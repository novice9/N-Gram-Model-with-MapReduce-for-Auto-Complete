Wikipedia
Wikipedia ( i / ˌ w ɪ k ᵻ ˈ p iː d i ə / or i / ˌ w ɪ k i ˈ p iː d i ə / WIK -i- PEE -dee-ə ) is a free online encyclopedia with the aim to allow anyone to edit articles. [3] Wikipedia is the largest and most popular general reference work on the Internet [4] [5] [6] and is ranked among the ten most popular websites. [7] Wikipedia is owned by the nonprofit Wikimedia Foundation . [8] [9] [10]
Wikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001, by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger . [11] Sanger coined its name , [12] [13] a portmanteau of wiki [notes 4] and encyclo pedia . There was only the English language version initially, but it quickly developed similar versions in other languages, which differ in content and in editing practices. With 5,412,796 articles , [notes 5] the English Wikipedia is the largest of the more than 290 Wikipedia encyclopedias. Overall, Wikipedia consists of more than 40 million articles in more than 250 different languages [15] and, as of February 2014 [update] , it had 18 billion page views and nearly 500 million unique visitors each month. [16]
As of March 2017, Wikipedia has about forty thousand high-quality articles known as Featured Articles and Good Articles that cover vital topics. [17] [18] In 2005, Nature published a peer review comparing 42 science articles from Encyclopædia Britannica and Wikipedia, and found that Wikipedia's level of accuracy approached Encyclopædia Britannica ' s. [19] Criticism of Wikipedia includes claims that it exhibits systemic bias , presents a mixture of "truths, half truths, and some falsehoods", [20] and that, in controversial topics, it is subject to manipulation and spin . [21]

History

Nupedia
Other collaborative online encyclopedias were attempted before Wikipedia, but none were so successful. [22]
Wikipedia began as a complementary project for Nupedia , a free online English-language encyclopedia project whose articles were written by experts and reviewed under a formal process. [11] Nupedia was founded on March 9, 2000, under the ownership of Bomis , a web portal company. Its main figures were Jimmy Wales , the CEO of Bomis, and Larry Sanger , editor-in-chief for Nupedia and later Wikipedia. Nupedia was licensed initially under its own Nupedia Open Content License, switching to the GNU Free Documentation License before Wikipedia's founding at the urging of Richard Stallman . [23] Sanger and Wales founded Wikipedia. [24] [25] While Wales is credited with defining the goal of making a publicly editable encyclopedia, [26] [27] Sanger is credited with the strategy of using a wiki to reach that goal. [28] On January 10, 2001, Sanger proposed on the Nupedia mailing list to create a wiki as a "feeder" project for Nupedia. [29]

Launch and early growth
Wikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001, as a single English-language edition at www.wikipedia.com, [30] and announced by Sanger on the Nupedia mailing list. [26] Wikipedia's policy of "neutral point-of-view" [31] was codified in its first months. Otherwise, there were relatively few rules initially and Wikipedia operated independently of Nupedia. [26] Originally, Bomis intended to make Wikipedia a business for profit. [32]
Wikipedia gained early contributors from Nupedia, Slashdot postings, and web search engine indexing. By August 8, 2001, Wikipedia had over 8,000 articles. [33] On September 25, 2001, Wikipedia had over 13,000 articles. [34] By the end of 2001, it had grown to approximately 20,000 articles and 18 language editions. It had reached 26 language editions by late 2002, 46 by the end of 2003, and 161 by the final days of 2004. [35] Nupedia and Wikipedia coexisted until the former's servers were taken down permanently in 2003, and its text was incorporated into Wikipedia. The English Wikipedia passed the mark of two million articles on September 9, 2007, making it the largest encyclopedia ever assembled, surpassing even the 1408 Yongle Encyclopedia , which had held the record for almost 600 years. [36]
Citing fears of commercial advertising and lack of control in Wikipedia, users of the Spanish Wikipedia forked from Wikipedia to create the Enciclopedia Libre in February 2002. [37] These moves encouraged Wales to announce that Wikipedia would not display advertisements, and to change Wikipedia's domain from wikipedia.com to wikipedia.org . [38]
Though the English Wikipedia reached three million articles in August 2009, the growth of the edition, in terms of the numbers of articles and of contributors, appears to have peaked around early 2007. [39] Around 1,800 articles were added daily to the encyclopedia in 2006; by 2013 that average was roughly 800. [40] A team at the Palo Alto Research Center attributed this slowing of growth to the project's increasing exclusivity and resistance to change. [41] Others suggest that the growth is flattening naturally because articles that could be called " low-hanging fruit "—topics that clearly merit an article—have already been created and built up extensively. [42] [43] [44]
In November 2009, a researcher at the Rey Juan Carlos University in Madrid ( Spain ) found that the English Wikipedia had lost 49,000 editors during the first three months of 2009; in comparison, the project lost only 4,900 editors during the same period in 2008. [45] [46] The Wall Street Journal cited the array of rules applied to editing and disputes related to such content among the reasons for this trend. [47] Wales disputed these claims in 2009, denying the decline and questioning the methodology of the study. [48] Two years later, in 2011, Wales acknowledged the presence of a slight decline, noting a decrease from "a little more than 36,000 writers" in June 2010 to 35,800 in June 2011. In the same interview, Wales also claimed the number of editors was "stable and sustainable". [49] A 2013 article titled "The Decline of Wikipedia" in MIT's Technology Review questioned this claim. The article revealed that since 2007, Wikipedia had lost a third of the volunteer editors who update and correct the online encyclopedia and those still there have focused increasingly on minutiae. [50] In July 2012, the Atlantic reported that the number of administrators is also in decline. [51] In the November 25, 2013, issue of New York magazine, Katherine Ward stated "Wikipedia, the sixth-most-used website, is facing an internal crisis". [52]

Milestones
In January 2007, Wikipedia entered for the first time the top-ten list of the most popular websites in the U.S., according to comScore Networks. With 42.9 million unique visitors, Wikipedia was ranked number 9, surpassing the New York Times (#10) and Apple (#11). This marked a significant increase over January 2006, when the rank was number 33, with Wikipedia receiving around 18.3 million unique visitors. [53] As of March 2015 [update] , Wikipedia has rank 5 [7] [54] among websites in terms of popularity according to Alexa Internet . In 2014, it received 8 billion pageviews every month. [55] On February 9, 2014, The New York Times reported that Wikipedia has 18 billion page views and nearly 500 million unique visitors a month, "according to the ratings firm comScore." [16]
On January 18, 2012, the English Wikipedia participated in a series of coordinated protests against two proposed laws in the United States Congress—the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the PROTECT IP Act (PIPA)—by blacking out its pages for 24 hours . [56] More than 162 million people viewed the blackout explanation page that temporarily replaced Wikipedia content. [57] [58]
Loveland and Reagle argue that, in process, Wikipedia follows a long tradition of historical encyclopedias that accumulated improvements piecemeal through " stigmergic accumulation". [59] [60]
On January 20, 2014, Subodh Varma reporting for The Economic Times indicated that not only had Wikipedia's growth flattened but that it has "lost nearly 10 per cent of its page-views last year. That's a decline of about 2 billion between December 2012 and December 2013. Its most popular versions are leading the slide: page-views of the English Wikipedia declined by 12 per cent, those of German version slid by 17 per cent and the Japanese version lost 9 per cent." [61] Varma added that, "While Wikipedia's managers think that this could be due to errors in counting, other experts feel that Google's Knowledge Graphs project launched last year may be gobbling up Wikipedia users." [61] When contacted on this matter, Clay Shirky, associate professor at New York University and fellow at Harvard's Berkman Center for Internet and Security indicated that he suspected much of the page view decline was due to Knowledge Graphs, stating, "If you can get your question answered from the search page, you don't need to click [any further]." [61]
By the end of December 2016, Wikipedia was ranked fifth in the most popular websites globally. [62]

Openness
Unlike traditional encyclopedias, Wikipedia follows the procrastination principle [notes 6] [64] regarding the security of its content. [64] It started almost entirely open—anyone could create articles, and any Wikipedia article could be edited by any reader, even those who did not have a Wikipedia account. Modifications to all articles would be published immediately. As a result, any article could contain inaccuracies such as errors, ideological biases, and nonsensical or irrelevant text.

Restrictions
Due to the increasing popularity of Wikipedia, popular editions, including the English version, have introduced editing restrictions in some cases. For instance, on the English Wikipedia and some other language editions, only registered users may create a new article. [65] On the English Wikipedia, among others, some particularly controversial, sensitive and/or vandalism-prone pages have been protected to some degree. [66] [67] A frequently vandalized article can be semi-protected or extended confirmed protected , meaning that only autoconfirmed or extended confirmed editors are able to modify it. [68] A particularly contentious article may be locked so that only administrators are able to make changes. [69]
In certain cases, all editors are allowed to submit modifications, but review is required for some editors, depending on certain conditions. For example, the German Wikipedia maintains "stable versions" of articles, [70] which have passed certain reviews. Following protracted trials and community discussion, the English Wikipedia introduced the "pending changes" system in December 2012. [71] Under this system, new and unregistered users' edits to certain controversial or vandalism-prone articles are reviewed by established users before they are published. [72]

Review of changes
Although changes are not systematically reviewed, the software that powers Wikipedia provides certain tools allowing anyone to review changes made by others. The "History" page of each article links to each revision. [notes 7] [73] On most articles, anyone can undo others' changes by clicking a link on the article's history page. Anyone can view the latest changes to articles, and anyone may maintain a "watchlist" of articles that interest them so they can be notified of any changes. "New pages patrol" is a process whereby newly created articles are checked for obvious problems. [74]
In 2003, economics PhD student Andrea Ciffolilli argued that the low transaction costs of participating in a wiki create a catalyst for collaborative development, and that features such as allowing easy access to past versions of a page favor "creative construction" over "creative destruction". [75]

Vandalism
Any change or edit that manipulates content in a way that purposefully compromises the integrity of Wikipedia is considered vandalism. The most common and obvious types of vandalism include additions of obscenities and crude humor. Vandalism can also include advertising and other types of spam. [76] Sometimes editors commit vandalism by removing content or entirely blanking a given page. Less common types of vandalism, such as the deliberate addition of plausible but false information to an article, can be more difficult to detect. Vandals can introduce irrelevant formatting, modify page semantics such as the page's title or categorization, manipulate the underlying code of an article, or use images disruptively. [77]
Obvious vandalism is generally easy to remove from Wikipedia articles; the median time to detect and fix vandalism is a few minutes. [78] [79] However, some vandalism takes much longer to repair. [80]
In the Seigenthaler biography incident , an anonymous editor introduced false information into the biography of American political figure John Seigenthaler in May 2005. Seigenthaler was falsely presented as a suspect in the assassination of John F. Kennedy. [80] The article remained uncorrected for four months. [80] Seigenthaler, the founding editorial director of USA Today and founder of the Freedom Forum First Amendment Center at Vanderbilt University , called Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales and asked whether he had any way of knowing who contributed the misinformation. Wales replied that he did not, although the perpetrator was eventually traced. [81] [82] After the incident, Seigenthaler described Wikipedia as "a flawed and irresponsible research tool". [80] This incident led to policy changes at Wikipedia, specifically targeted at tightening up the verifiability of biographical articles of living people . [83]

Policies and laws
Content in Wikipedia is subject to the laws (in particular, copyright laws) of the United States and of the U.S. state of Virginia , where the majority of Wikipedia's servers are located. Beyond legal matters, the editorial principles of Wikipedia are embodied in the "five pillars" and in numerous policies and guidelines intended to appropriately shape content. Even these rules are stored in wiki form, and Wikipedia editors write and revise the website's policies and guidelines. [84] Editors can enforce these rules by deleting or modifying non-compliant material. Originally, rules on the non-English editions of Wikipedia were based on a translation of the rules for the English Wikipedia. They have since diverged to some extent. [70]

Content policies and guidelines
According to the rules on the English Wikipedia, each entry in Wikipedia must be about a topic that is encyclopedic and is not a dictionary entry or dictionary-like. [85] A topic should also meet Wikipedia's standards of "notability" , [86] which generally means that the topic must have been covered in mainstream media or major academic journal sources that are independent of the article's subject. Further, Wikipedia intends to convey only knowledge that is already established and recognized. [87] It must not present original research . A claim that is likely to be challenged requires a reference to a reliable source . Among Wikipedia editors, this is often phrased as "verifiability, not truth" to express the idea that the readers, not the encyclopedia, are ultimately responsible for checking the truthfulness of the articles and making their own interpretations. [88] This can at times lead to the removal of information that is valid. [89] Finally, Wikipedia must not take sides. [90] All opinions and viewpoints, if attributable to external sources, must enjoy an appropriate share of coverage within an article. [91] This is known as neutral point of view (NPOV).

Governance
Wikipedia's initial anarchy integrated democratic and hierarchical elements over time. [92] [93] An article is not considered to be owned by its creator or any other editor and is not vetted by any recognized authority. [94] Wikipedia's contributors avoid a tragedy of the commons by internalizing benefits. They do this by experiencing flow and identifying with and gaining status in the Wikipedia community. [95]

Administrators
Editors in good standing in the community can run for one of many levels of volunteer stewardship: this begins with " administrator ", [96] [97] privileged users who can delete pages, prevent articles from being changed in case of vandalism or editorial disputes, and try to prevent certain persons from editing. Despite the name, administrators are not supposed to enjoy any special privilege in decision-making; instead, their powers are mostly limited to making edits that have project-wide effects and thus are disallowed to ordinary editors, and to implement restrictions intended to prevent certain persons from making disruptive edits (such as vandalism). [98] [99]
Fewer editors become administrators than in years past, in part because the process of vetting potential Wikipedia administrators has become more rigorous. [100]
Bureaucrats name new administrators, solely upon the recommendations from the community.

Dispute resolution
Wikipedians often have disputes regarding content, which may result in repeatedly making opposite changes to an article, known as edit warring [101] [102] Over time, Wikipedia has developed a semi-formal dispute resolution process to assist in such circumstances. In order to determine community consensus, editors can raise issues at appropriate community forums, [notes 8] or seek outside input through third opinion requests or by initiating a more general community discussion known as a request for comment .

Arbitration Committee
The Arbitration Committee presides over the ultimate dispute resolution process. Although disputes usually arise from a disagreement between two opposing views on how an article should read, the Arbitration Committee explicitly refuses to directly rule on the specific view that should be adopted. Statistical analyses suggest that the committee ignores the content of disputes and rather focuses on the way disputes are conducted, [103] functioning not so much to resolve disputes and make peace between conflicting editors, but to weed out problematic editors while allowing potentially productive editors back in to participate. Therefore, the committee does not dictate the content of articles, although it sometimes condemns content changes when it deems the new content violates Wikipedia policies (for example, if the new content is considered biased ). Its remedies include cautions and probations (used in 63% of cases) and banning editors from articles (43%), subject matters (23%) or Wikipedia (16%). Complete bans from Wikipedia are generally limited to instances of impersonation and anti-social behavior . When conduct is not impersonation or anti-social, but rather anti-consensus or in violation of editing policies, remedies tend to be limited to warnings. [104]

Community
Each article and each user of Wikipedia has an associated "Talk" page. These form the primary communication channel for editors to discuss, coordinate and debate. [105]
Wikipedia's community has been described as cult -like, [106] although not always with entirely negative connotations. [107] The project's preference for cohesiveness, even if it requires compromise that includes disregard of credentials , has been referred to as " anti-elitism ". [108]
Wikipedians sometimes award one another virtual barnstars for good work. These personalized tokens of appreciation reveal a wide range of valued work extending far beyond simple editing to include social support, administrative actions, and types of articulation work. [109]
Wikipedia does not require that its editors and contributors provide identification. [110] As Wikipedia grew, "Who writes Wikipedia?" became one of the questions frequently asked on the project. [111] Jimmy Wales once argued that only "a community ... a dedicated group of a few hundred volunteers" makes the bulk of contributions to Wikipedia and that the project is therefore "much like any traditional organization". [112] In 2008, a Slate magazine article reported that: "According to researchers in Palo Alto, 1 percent of Wikipedia users are responsible for about half of the site's edits." [113] This method of evaluating contributions was later disputed by Aaron Swartz , who noted that several articles he sampled had large portions of their content (measured by number of characters) contributed by users with low edit counts. [114]
The English Wikipedia has 5,412,796 articles, 31,022,168 registered editors, and 131,413 active editors. An editor is considered active if they have made one or more edits in the past thirty days.
Editors who fail to comply with Wikipedia cultural rituals, such as signing talk page comments, may implicitly signal that they are Wikipedia outsiders, increasing the odds that Wikipedia insiders may target or discount their contributions. Becoming a Wikipedia insider involves non-trivial costs: the contributor is expected to learn Wikipedia-specific technological codes, submit to a sometimes convoluted dispute resolution process, and learn a "baffling culture rich with in-jokes and insider references". [115] Editors who do not log in are in some sense second-class citizens on Wikipedia, [115] as "participants are accredited by members of the wiki community, who have a vested interest in preserving the quality of the work product, on the basis of their ongoing participation", [116] but the contribution histories of anonymous unregistered editors recognized only by their IP addresses cannot be attributed to a particular editor with certainty.
A 2007 study by researchers from Dartmouth College found that "anonymous and infrequent contributors to Wikipedia […] are as reliable a source of knowledge as those contributors who register with the site". [117] Jimmy Wales stated in 2009 that "(I)t turns out over 50% of all the edits are done by just .7% of the users... 524 people... And in fact the most active 2%, which is 1400 people, have done 73.4% of all the edits." [112] However, Business Insider editor and journalist Henry Blodget showed in 2009 that in a random sample of articles, most content in Wikipedia (measured by the amount of contributed text that survives to the latest sampled edit) is created by "outsiders", while most editing and formatting is done by "insiders". [112]
A 2008 study found that Wikipedians were less agreeable, open, and conscientious than others, [118] [119] although a later commentary pointed out serious flaws, including that the data showed higher openness, that the differences with the control group were small as were the samples. [120] According to a 2009 study, there is "evidence of growing resistance from the Wikipedia community to new content". [121]

Diversity
One study found that the contributor base to Wikipedia "was barely 13% women; the average age of a contributor was in the mid-20s". [122] A 2011 study by researchers from the University of Minnesota found that females comprised 16.1% of the 38,497 editors who started editing Wikipedia during 2009. [123] In a January 2011 New York Times article, Noam Cohen observed that just 13% of Wikipedia's contributors are female according to a 2008 Wikimedia Foundation survey. [124] Sue Gardner , a former executive director of the Wikimedia Foundation, hoped to see female contributions increase to 25% by 2015. [125] Linda Basch, president of the National Council for Research on Women, noted the contrast in these Wikipedia editor statistics with the percentage of women currently completing bachelor's degrees, master's degrees and PhD programs in the United States (all at rates of 50 percent or greater). [126]
In response, various universities have hosted edit-a-thons to encourage more women to participate in the Wikipedia community. In fall 2013, 15 colleges and universities — including Yale, Brown, and Pennsylvania State — offered college credit for students to "write feminist thinking" about technology into Wikipedia. [127] Estimates of the diversity of contributors by educational level have indicated that sixty-two percent of Wikipedia's editors are at the high school and undergraduate college level of education. [128]
In August 2014, Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales said in a BBC interview that the Wikimedia Foundation was "... really doubling down our efforts ..." to reach 25% of female editors (originally targeted by 2015), since the Foundation had "totally failed" so far. Wales said "a lot of things need to happen ... a lot of outreach, a lot of software changes". [129] Andrew Lih, writing in The New York Times , was quoted by Bloomberg News in December 2016 as supporting Wales comments concerning shortfalls in Wikipedia's outreach to female editors. Lih states his concern with the question indicating that: "How can you get people to participate in an (editing) environment that feels unsafe, where identifying yourself as a woman, as a feminist, could open you up to ugly, intimidating behavior". [130]

Language editions
There are currently 295 language editions of Wikipedia (also called language versions , or simply Wikipedias ). Thirteen of these have over one million articles each ( English , Swedish , Cebuano , German , Dutch , French , Russian , Italian , Spanish , Waray-Waray , Polish , Vietnamese and Japanese ), five more have over 500,000 articles ( Portuguese , Chinese , Ukrainian , Catalan and Persian ), 40 more have over 100,000 articles, and 77 more have over 10,000 articles. [131] [132] The largest, the English Wikipedia, has over 5.4 million articles. As of January 2017 [update] , according to Alexa, the English subdomain (en.wikipedia.org; English Wikipedia) receives approximately 55% of Wikipedia's cumulative traffic, with the remaining split among the other languages (Russian: 9%; Japanese: 7%; Spanish: 6%; French: 4%). [7] As of May 2017, the six largest language editions are (in order of article count) the English , Cebuano , Swedish , German , Dutch , and French Wikipedias. [133]
The unit for the numbers in bars is articles.
Since Wikipedia is based on the Web and therefore worldwide, contributors to the same language edition may use different dialects or may come from different countries (as is the case for the English edition ). These differences may lead to some conflicts over spelling differences (e.g. colour versus color ) [136] or points of view. [137]
Though the various language editions are held to global policies such as "neutral point of view", they diverge on some points of policy and practice, most notably on whether images that are not licensed freely may be used under a claim of fair use . [138] [139] [140]
Jimmy Wales has described Wikipedia as "an effort to create and distribute a free encyclopedia of the highest possible quality to every single person on the planet in their own language". [141] Though each language edition functions more or less independently, some efforts are made to supervise them all. They are coordinated in part by Meta-Wiki, the Wikimedia Foundation's wiki devoted to maintaining all of its projects (Wikipedia and others). [142] For instance, Meta-Wiki provides important statistics on all language editions of Wikipedia, [143] and it maintains a list of articles every Wikipedia should have. [144] The list concerns basic content by subject: biography, history, geography, society, culture, science, technology, and mathematics. As for the rest, it is not rare for articles strongly related to a particular language not to have counterparts in another edition. For example, articles about small towns in the United States might only be available in English, even when they meet notability criteria of other language Wikipedia projects.
Translated articles represent only a small portion of articles in most editions, in part because fully automated translation of articles is disallowed. [145] Articles available in more than one language may offer " interwiki links ", which link to the counterpart articles in other editions.
A study published by PLOS ONE in 2012 also estimated the share of contributions to different editions of Wikipedia from different regions of the world. It reported that the proportion of the edits made from North America was 51% for the English Wikipedia , and 25% for the simple English Wikipedia . [146] The Wikimedia Foundation hopes to increase the number of editors in the Global South to thirty-seven percent by 2015. [147]
On March 1, 2014, The Economist in an article titled "The Future of Wikipedia" cited a trend analysis concerning data published by Wikimedia stating that: "The number of editors for the English-language version has fallen by a third in seven years." [148] The attrition rate for active editors in English Wikipedia was cited by The Economist as substantially in contrast to statistics for Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia). The Economist reported that the number of contributors with an average of five of more edits per month was relatively constant since 2008 for Wikipedia in other languages at approximately 42,000 editors within narrow seasonal variances of about 2,000 editors up or down. The attrition rates for editors in English Wikipedia, by sharp comparison, were cited as peaking in 2007 at approximately 50,000 editors which has dropped to 30,000 editors as of the start of 2014. At the quoted trend rate, the number of active editors in English Wikipedia has lost approximately 20,000 editors to attrition since 2007, and the documented trend rate indicates the loss of another 20,000 editors by 2021, down to 10,000 active editors on English Wikipedia by 2021 if left unabated. [148] Given that the trend analysis published in The Economist presents the number of active editors for Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia) as remaining relatively constant and successful in sustaining its numbers at approximately 42,000 active editors, the contrast has pointed to the effectiveness of Wikipedia in other languages to retain its active editors on a renewable and sustained basis. [148] No comment was made concerning which of the differentiated edit policy standards from Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia) would provide a possible alternative to English Wikipedia for effectively ameliorating substantial editor attrition rates on the English language Wikipedia. [149]

Critical reception
Several Wikipedians have criticized Wikipedia's large and growing regulation , which includes over 50 policies and nearly 150,000 words as of 2014 [update] . [150] [151]
Critics have stated that Wikipedia exhibits systemic bias . Columnist and journalist Edwin Black criticizes Wikipedia for being a mixture of "truth, half truth, and some falsehoods". [20] Articles in The Chronicle of Higher Education and The Journal of Academic Librarianship have criticized Wikipedia's Undue Weight policy, concluding that the fact that Wikipedia explicitly is not designed to provide correct information about a subject, but rather focus on all the major viewpoints on the subject and give less attention to minor ones, creates omissions that can lead to false beliefs based on incomplete information. [152] [153] [154]
Journalists Oliver Kamm and Edwin Black noted how articles are dominated by the loudest and most persistent voices, usually by a group with an "ax to grind" on the topic. [20] [155] An article in Education Next Journal concluded that as a resource about controversial topics, Wikipedia is notoriously subject to manipulation and spin . [21]
In 2006, the Wikipedia Watch criticism website listed dozens of examples of plagiarism in the English Wikipedia. [156]

Accuracy of content
Articles for traditional encyclopedias such as Encyclopædia Britannica are carefully and deliberately written by experts, lending such encyclopedias a reputation for accuracy. [157] Conversely, Wikipedia is often cited for factual inaccuracies and misrepresentations. However, a peer review in 2005 of forty-two scientific entries on both Wikipedia and Encyclopædia Britannica by the science journal Nature found few differences in accuracy, and concluded that "the average science entry in Wikipedia contained around four inaccuracies; Britannica , about three." [19] Reagle suggested that while the study reflects "a topical strength of Wikipedia contributors" in science articles, "Wikipedia may not have fared so well using a random sampling of articles or on humanities subjects." [158] The findings by Nature were disputed by Encyclopædia Britannica , [159] [160] and in response, Nature gave a rebuttal of the points raised by Britannica . [161] In addition to the point-for-point disagreement between these two parties, others have examined the sample size and selection method used in the Nature effort, and suggested a "flawed study design" (in Nature ' s manual selection of articles, in part or in whole, for comparison), absence of statistical analysis (e.g., of reported confidence intervals ), and a lack of study "statistical power" (i.e., owing to small sample size, 42 or 4 x 10 1 articles compared, vs >10 5 and >10 6 set sizes for Britannica and the English Wikipedia, respectively). [162]
As a consequence of the open structure, Wikipedia "makes no guarantee of validity" of its content, since no one is ultimately responsible for any claims appearing in it. [163] Concerns have been raised by PC World in 2009 regarding the lack of accountability that results from users' anonymity, [164] the insertion of false information, [165] vandalism , and similar problems.
Economist Tyler Cowen wrote: "If I had to guess whether Wikipedia or the median refereed journal article on economics was more likely to be true, after a not so long think I would opt for Wikipedia." He comments that some traditional sources of non-fiction suffer from systemic biases and novel results, in his opinion, are over-reported in journal articles and relevant information is omitted from news reports. However, he also cautions that errors are frequently found on Internet sites, and that academics and experts must be vigilant in correcting them. [166]
Critics argue that Wikipedia's open nature and a lack of proper sources for most of the information makes it unreliable. [167] Some commentators suggest that Wikipedia may be reliable, but that the reliability of any given article is not clear. [168] Editors of traditional reference works such as the Encyclopædia Britannica have questioned the project's utility and status as an encyclopedia. [169]
Wikipedia's open structure inherently makes it an easy target for Internet trolls , spammers , and various forms of paid advocacy seen as counterproductive to the maintenance of a neutral and verifiable online encyclopedia. [73] [171] In response to paid advocacy editing and undisclosed editing issues, Wikipedia was reported in an article by Jeff Elder in The Wall Street Journal on June 16, 2014, to have strengthened its rules and laws against undisclosed editing. [172] The article stated that: "Beginning Monday [from date of article], changes in Wikipedia's terms of use will require anyone paid to edit articles to disclose that arrangement. Katherine Maher , the nonprofit Wikimedia Foundation's chief communications officer, said the changes address a sentiment among volunteer editors that, 'we're not an advertising service; we're an encyclopedia.'" [172] [173] [174] [175] [176] These issues, among others, had been parodied since the first decade of Wikipedia, notably by Stephen Colbert on The Colbert Report . [177]
Most university lecturers discourage students from citing any encyclopedia in academic work , preferring primary sources ; [178] some specifically prohibit Wikipedia citations. [179] [180] Wales stresses that encyclopedias of any type are not usually appropriate to use as citeable sources, and should not be relied upon as authoritative. [181] Wales once (2006 or earlier) said he receives about ten emails weekly from students saying they got failing grades on papers because they cited Wikipedia; he told the students they got what they deserved. "For God's sake, you're in college; don't cite the encyclopedia", he said. [182]
In February 2007, an article in The Harvard Crimson newspaper reported that a few of the professors at Harvard University were including Wikipedia articles in their syllabi , although without realizing the articles might change. [183] In June 2007, former president of the American Library Association Michael Gorman condemned Wikipedia, along with Google , [184] stating that academics who endorse the use of Wikipedia are "the intellectual equivalent of a dietitian who recommends a steady diet of Big Macs with everything".
A Harvard law textbook, Legal Research in a Nutshell (2011), cites Wikipedia as a "general source" that "can be a real boon" in "coming up to speed in the law governing a situation" and, "while not authoritative, can provide basic facts as well as leads to more in-depth resources". [185]

Medical information
On March 5, 2014, Julie Beck writing for The Atlantic magazine in an article titled "Doctors' #1 Source for Healthcare Information: Wikipedia", stated that "Fifty percent of physicians look up conditions on the (Wikipedia) site, and some are editing articles themselves to improve the quality of available information." [186] Beck continued to detail in this article new programs of Dr. Amin Azzam at the University of San Francisco to offer medical school courses to medical students for learning to edit and improve Wikipedia articles on health-related issues , as well as internal quality control programs within Wikipedia organized by Dr. James Heilman to improve a group of 200 health-related articles of central medical importance up to Wikipedia's highest standard of articles using its Featured Article and Good Article peer review evaluation process. [186] In a May 7, 2014, follow-up article in The Atlantic titled "Can Wikipedia Ever Be a Definitive Medical Text?", Julie Beck quotes Wikiproject Medicine's Dr. James Heilman as stating: "Just because a reference is peer-reviewed doesn't mean it's a high-quality reference." [187] Beck added that: "Wikipedia has its own peer review process before articles can be classified as 'good' or 'featured.' Heilman, who has participated in that process before, says 'less than 1 percent' of Wikipedia's medical articles have passed. [187]

Quality of writing
In 2008, researchers at Carnegie Mellon University found that the quality of a Wikipedia article would suffer rather than gain from adding more writers when the article lacked appropriate explicit or implicit coordination. [188] For instance, when contributors rewrite small portions of an entry rather than making full-length revisions, high- and low-quality content may be intermingled within an entry. Roy Rosenzweig , a history professor, stated that American National Biography Online outperformed Wikipedia in terms of its "clear and engaging prose", which, he said, was an important aspect of good historical writing. [189] Contrasting Wikipedia's treatment of Abraham Lincoln to that of Civil War historian James McPherson in American National Biography Online , he said that both were essentially accurate and covered the major episodes in Lincoln's life, but praised "McPherson's richer contextualization […] his artful use of quotations to capture Lincoln's voice […] and […] his ability to convey a profound message in a handful of words." By contrast, he gives an example of Wikipedia's prose that he finds "both verbose and dull". Rosenzweig also criticized the "waffling—encouraged by the NPOV policy—[which] means that it is hard to discern any overall interpretive stance in Wikipedia history". By example, he quoted the conclusion of Wikipedia's article on William Clarke Quantrill . While generally praising the article, he pointed out its "waffling" conclusion: "Some historians […] remember him as an opportunistic, bloodthirsty outlaw, while others continue to view him as a daring soldier and local folk hero." [189]
Other critics have made similar charges that, even if Wikipedia articles are factually accurate, they are often written in a poor, almost unreadable style. Frequent Wikipedia critic Andrew Orlowski commented: "Even when a Wikipedia entry is 100 per cent factually correct, and those facts have been carefully chosen, it all too often reads as if it has been translated from one language to another then into to a third, passing an illiterate translator at each stage." [190] A study of Wikipedia articles on cancer was conducted in 2010 by Yaacov Lawrence of the Kimmel Cancer Center at Thomas Jefferson University . The study was limited to those articles that could be found in the Physician Data Query and excluded those written at the "start" class or "stub" class level. Lawrence found the articles accurate but not very readable, and thought that "Wikipedia's lack of readability (to non-college readers) may reflect its varied origins and haphazard editing". [191] The Economist argued that better-written articles tend to be more reliable: "inelegant or ranting prose usually reflects muddled thoughts and incomplete information". [192]

Coverage of topics and systemic bias
Wikipedia seeks to create a summary of all human knowledge in the form of an online encyclopedia, with each topic covered encyclopedically in one article. Since it has terabytes of disk space, it can have far more topics than can be covered by any printed encyclopedia. [193] The exact degree and manner of coverage on Wikipedia is under constant review by its editors, and disagreements are not uncommon (see deletionism and inclusionism ). [194] [195] Wikipedia contains materials that some people may find objectionable, offensive, or pornographic because Wikipedia is not censored . The policy has sometimes proved controversial: in 2008, Wikipedia rejected an online petition against the inclusion of images of Muhammad in the English edition of its Muhammad article, citing this policy. The presence of politically, religiously, and pornographically sensitive materials in Wikipedia has led to the censorship of Wikipedia by national authorities in China , [196] Pakistan , [197] and the United Kingdom , [198] among other countries.
A 2008 study conducted by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University and Palo Alto Research Center gave a distribution of topics as well as growth (from July 2006 to January 2008) in each field: [199]
These numbers refer only to the quantity of articles: it is possible for one topic to contain a large number of short articles and another to contain a small number of large ones. Through its " Wikipedia Loves Libraries " program, Wikipedia has partnered with major public libraries such as the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts to expand its coverage of underrepresented subjects and articles. [200]
A 2011 study conducted by researchers at the University of Minnesota indicated that male and female editors focus on different coverage topics. There was a greater concentration of females in the People and Arts category, while males focus more on Geography and Science. [201]

Coverage of topics and selection bias
Research conducted by Mark Graham of the Oxford Internet Institute in 2009 indicated that the geographic distribution of article topics is highly uneven. Africa is most underrepresented. [202]
An editorial in The Guardian in 2014 noted that women porn stars are better covered than women writers as a further example. [203]

Systemic bias
When multiple editors contribute to one topic or set of topics, systemic bias may arise, due to the demographic backgrounds of the editors. In 2011, Wales noted that the unevenness of coverage is a reflection of the demography of the editors, which predominantly consists of young males with high education levels in the developed world (cf. previously). [49] The October 22, 2013 essay by Tom Simonite in MIT's Technology Review titled "The Decline of Wikipedia" discussed the effect of systemic bias and policy creep on the downward trend in the number of editors . [50]
Systemic bias on Wikipedia may follow that of culture generally, for example favoring certain nationalities, ethnicities or majority religions. [204] It may more specifically follow the biases of Internet culture , inclining to being young, male, English-speaking, educated, technologically aware, and wealthy enough to spare time for editing. Biases of its own may include over-emphasis on topics such as pop culture, technology, and current events. [204]
Taha Yasseri of the University of Oxford , in 2013, studied the statistical trends of systemic bias at Wikipedia introduced by editing conflicts and their resolution. [205] [206] His research examined the counterproductive work behavior of edit warring. Yasseri contended that simple reverts or "undo" operations were not the most significant measure of counterproductive behavior at Wikipedia and relied instead on the statistical measurement of detecting "reverting/reverted pairs" or "mutually reverting edit pairs". Such a "mutually reverting edit pair" is defined where one editor reverts the edit of another editor who then, in sequence, returns to revert the first editor in the "mutually reverting edit pairs". The results were tabulated for several language versions of Wikipedia. The English Wikipedia's three largest conflict rates belonged to the articles George W. Bush , Anarchism and Muhammad . [206] By comparison, for the German Wikipedia, the three largest conflict rates at the time of the Oxford study were for the articles covering (i) Croatia , (ii) Scientology and (iii) 9/11 conspiracy theories . [206]
Researchers from the Washington University developed a statistical model to measure systematic bias in the behavior of Wikipedia's users regarding controversial topics. The authors focused on behavioral changes of the encyclopedia's administrators after assuming the post, writing that systematic bias occurred after the fact. [207] [208]

Identifying the filter-bubble problem
Dimitra Kessenides, writing for Bloomberg News Weekly, identified the ' filter-bubble ' problem as a recurrent and long-standing issue at Wikipedia. [209] As Kessenides states: "If the only way to get an article about the developing world published on Wikipedia was to know a former board member, it was hard to imagine how a random editor in Johannesburg or Bangalore would have any hope... This so-called filter-bubble problem, coined by Eli Pariser , co-founder of the viral video site Upworthy , is the idea that the internet can contribute to the insularity of certain communities. Filter bubbles have been blamed for the spread of misinformation during the 2016 presidential election and for the failure of pundits in the U.K. to anticipate Brexit... Wikipedia's filter-bubble problem is a particularly acute threat for an organization whose stated mission is 'to empower and engage people around the world.'" [209]

Explicit content
Wikipedia has been criticized for allowing information of graphic content. Articles depicting arguably objectionable content (such as Feces , Cadaver , Human penis , Vulva , and Nudity ) contain graphic pictures and detailed information easily available to anyone with access to the internet, including children.
The site also includes sexual content such as images and videos of masturbation and ejaculation , photographs of nude children , illustrations of zoophilia , and photos from hardcore pornographic films in its articles.
The Wikipedia article about Virgin Killer — a 1976 album from German heavy metal band Scorpions —features a picture of the album's original cover, which depicts a naked prepubescent girl. The original release cover caused controversy and was replaced in some countries. In December 2008, access to the Wikipedia article Virgin Killer was blocked for four days by most Internet service providers in the United Kingdom after the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) decided the album cover was a potentially illegal indecent image and added the article's URL to a "blacklist" it supplies to British internet service providers. [211] That the IWF, a non-government-affiliated organization, had so much control was described as "alarming". [212]
In April 2010, Sanger wrote a letter to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, outlining his concerns that two categories of images on Wikimedia Commons contained child pornography, and were in violation of US federal obscenity law . [213] [214] Sanger later clarified that the images, which were related to pedophilia and one about lolicon , were not of real children, but said that they constituted "obscene visual representations of the sexual abuse of children", under the PROTECT Act of 2003 . [215] That law bans photographic child pornography and cartoon images and drawings of children that are obscene under American law . [215] Sanger also expressed concerns about access to the images on Wikipedia in schools. [216] Wikimedia Foundation spokesman Jay Walsh strongly rejected Sanger's accusation, [217] saying that Wikipedia did not have "material we would deem to be illegal. If we did, we would remove it." [217] Following the complaint by Sanger, Wales deleted sexual images without consulting the community. After some editors who volunteer to maintain the site argued that the decision to delete had been made hastily, Wales voluntarily gave up some of the powers he had held up to that time as part of his co-founder status. He wrote in a message to the Wikimedia Foundation mailing-list that this action was "in the interest of encouraging this discussion to be about real philosophical/content issues, rather than be about me and how quickly I acted". [218] Critics, including Wikipediocracy , noticed that many of the pornographic images deleted from Wikipedia since 2010 have reappeared. [219]

Privacy
One privacy concern in the case of Wikipedia is the right of a private citizen to remain a "private citizen" rather than a " public figure " in the eyes of the law. [220] [notes 9] It is a battle between the right to be anonymous in cyberspace and the right to be anonymous in real life (" meatspace "). A particular problem occurs in the case of an individual who is relatively unimportant and for whom there exists a Wikipedia page against her or his wishes.
In January 2006, a German court ordered the German Wikipedia shut down within Germany because it stated the full name of Boris Floricic , aka "Tron", a deceased hacker. On February 9, 2006, the injunction against Wikimedia Deutschland was overturned, with the court rejecting the notion that Tron's right to privacy or that of his parents was being violated. [221]
Wikipedia has a " Volunteer Response Team " that uses the OTRS system to handle queries without having to reveal the identities of the involved parties. This is used, for example, in confirming the permission for using individual images and other media in the project. [222]

Sexism
Wikipedia has been described as harboring a battleground culture of sexism and harassment . [223] [224] The perceived toxic attitudes and tolerance of violent and abusive language are also reasons put forth for the gender gap in Wikipedia editors. [225] In 2014, a female editor who requested a separate space on Wikipedia to discuss improving civility had her proposal referred to by a male editor using the words "the easiest way to avoid being called a cunt is not to act like one." [226]

Operation
A group of Wikipedia editors may form a WikiProject to focus their work on a specific topic area, using its associated discussion page to coordinate changes across multiple articles. [227]

Wikimedia Foundation and Wikimedia movement affiliates
Wikipedia is hosted and funded by the Wikimedia Foundation , a non-profit organization which also operates Wikipedia-related projects such as Wiktionary and Wikibooks . The foundation relies on public contributions and grants to fund its mission. [228] The foundation's 2013 IRS Form 990 shows revenue of $39.7 million and expenses of almost $29 million, with assets of $37.2 million and liabilities of about $2.3 million. [229]
In May 2014, Wikimedia Foundation named Lila Tretikov as its second executive director, taking over for Sue Gardner. [230] The Wall Street Journal reported on May 1, 2014, that Tretikov's information technology background from her years at University of California offers Wikipedia an opportunity to develop in more concentrated directions guided by her often repeated position statement that, "Information, like air, wants to be free." [231] [232] The same Wall Street Journal article reported these directions of development according to an interview with spokesman Jay Walsh of Wikimedia, who "said Tretikov would address that issue ( paid advocacy ) as a priority. 'We are really pushing toward more transparency... We are reinforcing that paid advocacy is not welcome.' Initiatives to involve greater diversity of contributors, better mobile support of Wikipedia, new geo-location tools to find local content more easily, and more tools for users in the second and third world are also priorities, Walsh said." [231]
Following the departure of Tretikov from Wikipedia due to issues concerning the use of the "superprotection" feature which some language versions of Wikipedia have adopted, Katherine Maher became the third executive director the Wikimedia Foundation in June 2016. [233] Maher has stated that one of her priorities would be the issue of editor harassment endemic to Wikipedia as identified by the Wikipedia board in December. Maher stated regarding the harassment issue that: "It establishes a sense within the community that this is a priority... (and that correction requires that) it has to be more than words." [234]
Wikipedia is also supported by many organizations and groups that are affiliated with the Wikimedia Foundation but independently-run, called Wikimedia movement affiliates . These include Wikimedia chapters (which are national or sub-national organizations, such as Wikimedia Deutschland and Wikimédia France), thematic organizations (such as Amical Wikimedia for the Catalan language community), and user groups. These affiliates participate in the promotion, development, and funding of Wikipedia.

Software operations and support
The operation of Wikipedia depends on MediaWiki , a custom-made, free and open source wiki software platform written in PHP and built upon the MySQL database system. [235] The software incorporates programming features such as a macro language , variables , a transclusion system for templates , and URL redirection . MediaWiki is licensed under the GNU General Public License and it is used by all Wikimedia projects, as well as many other wiki projects. Originally, Wikipedia ran on UseModWiki written in Perl by Clifford Adams (Phase I), which initially required CamelCase for article hyperlinks; the present double bracket style was incorporated later. Starting in January 2002 (Phase II), Wikipedia began running on a PHP wiki engine with a MySQL database; this software was custom-made for Wikipedia by Magnus Manske . The Phase II software was repeatedly modified to accommodate the exponentially increasing demand. In July 2002 (Phase III), Wikipedia shifted to the third-generation software, MediaWiki, originally written by Lee Daniel Crocker .
Several MediaWiki extensions are installed [236] to extend the functionality of the MediaWiki software.
In April 2005, a Lucene extension [237] [238] was added to MediaWiki's built-in search and Wikipedia switched from MySQL to Lucene for searching. The site currently uses Lucene Search 2.1, [239] [ needs update ] which is written in Java and based on Lucene library 2.3. [240]
In July 2013, after extensive beta testing, a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) extension, VisualEditor , was opened to public use. [241] [242] [243] [244] It was met with much rejection and criticism, and was described as "slow and buggy". [245] The feature was changed from opt-out to opt-in afterward.

Automated editing
Computer programs called bots have been used widely to perform simple and repetitive tasks, such as correcting common misspellings and stylistic issues, or to start articles such as geography entries in a standard format from statistical data. [246] [247] [248] One controversial contributor massively creating articles with his bot was reported to create up to ten thousand articles on the Swedish Wikipedia on certain days. [249] There are also some bots designed to automatically notify editors when they make common editing errors (such as unmatched quotes or unmatched parenthesis). [250] Edits misidentified by a bot as the work of a banned editor can be restored by other editors. An anti-vandal bot tries to detect and revert vandalism quickly and automatically. [247] Bots can also report edits from particular accounts or IP address ranges, as was done at the time of the MH17 jet downing incident in July 2014. [251] Bots on Wikipedia must be approved prior to activation. [252]
According to Andrew Lih , the current expansion of Wikipedia to millions of articles would be difficult to envision without the use of such bots. [253]

Wikiprojects, and assessments of articles' importance and quality
A " WikiProject " is a group of contributors who want to work together as a team to improve Wikipedia. These groups often focus on a specific topic area (for example, women's history ), a specific location or a specific kind of task (for example, checking newly created pages). The English Wikipedia currently has over 2,000 WikiProjects and activity varies. [254]
In 2007, in preparation for producing a print version, the English Wikipedia introduced an assessment scale of the quality of articles. [255] Articles are rated by WikiProjects. The range of quality classes begins with "Stub" (very short pages), followed by "Start", "C" and "B" (in increasing order of quality). Community peer review is needed for the article to enter one of the highest quality classes: either "A", " good article " or the highest, " featured article ". Of the about 4.4 million articles and lists assessed as of March 2015, a little more than 5,000 (0.12%) are featured articles, and fewer than 2,000 (0.04%) are featured lists. One featured article per day, as selected by editors, appears on the main page of Wikipedia. [256] [257]
The articles can also be rated as per "importance" as judged by a WikiProject. Currently, there are 5 importance categories: "low", "mid", "high", "top", and "???" for unclassified/uncertain level. For a particular article, different WikiProjects may assign different importance levels.
The Wikipedia Version 1.0 Editorial Team has developed a table (shown below) that displays data of all rated articles by quality and importance, on the English Wikipedia. If an article or list receives different ratings by two or more WikiProjects, then the highest rating is used in the table, pie-charts, and bar-chart. The software regularly auto-updates the data.
Researcher Giacomo Poderi found that articles tend to reach featured status via the intensive work of a few editors. [258] A 2010 study found unevenness in quality among featured articles and concluded that the community process is ineffective in assessing the quality of articles. [259]
[Note: The table above (prepared by the Wikipedia Version 1.0 Editorial Team ) is automatically updated daily by User:WP 1.0 bot , but the bar-chart and the two pie-charts are not auto-updated. In them, new data has to be entered by a Wikipedia editor (i.e. user).]

Hardware operations and support
Wikipedia receives between 25,000 and 60,000 page requests per second, depending on time of day. [261] As of 2008 [update] page requests are first passed to a front-end layer of Squid caching servers. [262] [ needs update ] Further statistics, based on a publicly available 3-month Wikipedia access trace, are available. [263] Requests that cannot be served from the Squid cache are sent to load-balancing servers running the Linux Virtual Server software, which in turn pass them to one of the Apache web servers for page rendering from the database. The web servers deliver pages as requested, performing page rendering for all the language editions of Wikipedia. To increase speed further, rendered pages are cached in a distributed memory cache until invalidated, allowing page rendering to be skipped entirely for most common page accesses.
Wikipedia currently runs on dedicated clusters of Linux servers (mainly Ubuntu ). [264] [265] As of December 2009 [update] , there were 300 in Florida and 44 in Amsterdam . [266] By January 22, 2013, Wikipedia had migrated its primary data center to an Equinix facility in Ashburn, Virginia . [267] [268]

Internal research and operational development
In accordance with growing amounts of incoming donations exceeding seven digits in 2013 as recently reported, [50] the Foundation has reached a threshold of assets which qualify its consideration under the principles of industrial organization economics to indicate the need for the re-investment of donations into the internal research and development of the Foundation. [269] Two of the recent projects of such internal research and development have been the creation of a Visual Editor and a largely under-utilized "Thank" tab which were developed for the purpose of ameliorating issues of editor attrition, which have met with limited success. [50] [245] The estimates for reinvestment by industrial organizations into internal research and development was studied by Adam Jaffe, who recorded that the range of 4% to 25% annually was to be recommended, with high end technology requiring the higher level of support for internal reinvestment. [270] At the 2013 level of contributions for Wikimedia presently documented as 45 million dollars, the computed budget level recommended by Jaffe and Caballero for reinvestment into internal research and development is between 1.8 million and 11.3 million dollars annually. [270] In 2016, the level of contributions were reported by Blomberg News as being at $77 million annually, updating the Jaffe estimates for the higher level of support to between 3.08 million and 19.2 million dollars annually. [270]

Internal news publications
Community-produced news publications include the English Wikipedia's The Signpost , founded in 2005 by Michael Snow, an attorney, Wikipedia administrator and former chair of the Wikimedia Foundation board of trustees. [271] It covers news and events from the site, as well as major events from other Wikimedia projects , such as Wikimedia Commons . Similar publications are the German-language Kurier , and the Portuguese-language Correio da Wikipédia . Other past and present community news publications on English Wikipedia include the "Wikiworld" web comic, the Wikipedia Weekly podcast, and newsletters of specific WikiProjects like The Bugle from WikiProject Military History and the monthly newsletter from The Guild of Copy Editors . There are also a number of publications from the Wikimedia Foundation and multilingual publications such as the Wikimedia Blog and This Month in Education .

Access to content

Content licensing
When the project was started in 2001, all text in Wikipedia was covered by the GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL), a copyleft license permitting the redistribution, creation of derivative works, and commercial use of content while authors retain copyright of their work. [272] The GFDL was created for software manuals that come with free software programs licensed under the GPL . This made it a poor choice for a general reference work: for example, the GFDL requires the reprints of materials from Wikipedia to come with a full copy of the GFDL text. In December 2002, the Creative Commons license was released: it was specifically designed for creative works in general, not just for software manuals. The license gained popularity among bloggers and others distributing creative works on the Web. The Wikipedia project sought the switch to the Creative Commons. [273] Because the two licenses, GFDL and Creative Commons, were incompatible, in November 2008, following the request of the project, the Free Software Foundation (FSF) released a new version of the GFDL designed specifically to allow Wikipedia to relicense its content to CC BY-SA by August 1, 2009. (A new version of the GFDL automatically covers Wikipedia contents.) In April 2009, Wikipedia and its sister projects held a community-wide referendum which decided the switch in June 2009. [274] [275] [276] [277]
The handling of media files (e.g. image files) varies across language editions. Some language editions, such as the English Wikipedia, include non-free image files under fair use doctrine, while the others have opted not to, in part because of the lack of fair use doctrines in their home countries (e.g. in Japanese copyright law ). Media files covered by free content licenses (e.g. Creative Commons ' CC BY-SA) are shared across language editions via Wikimedia Commons repository, a project operated by the Wikimedia Foundation. Wikipedia's accommodation of varying international copyright laws regarding images has led some to observe that its photographic coverage of topics lags behind the quality of the encyclopedic text. [278]
The Wikimedia Foundation is not a licensor of content, but merely a hosting service for the contributors (and licensors) of the Wikipedia. This position has been successfully defended in court. [279] [280]

Methods of access
Because Wikipedia content is distributed under an open license, anyone can reuse or re-distribute it at no charge. The content of Wikipedia has been published in many forms, both online and offline, outside of the Wikipedia website.
Obtaining the full contents of Wikipedia for reuse presents challenges, since direct cloning via a web crawler is discouraged. [291] Wikipedia publishes "dumps" of its contents, but these are text-only; as of 2007 [update] there was no dump available of Wikipedia's images. [292]
Several languages of Wikipedia also maintain a reference desk , where volunteers answer questions from the general public. According to a study by Pnina Shachaf in the Journal of Documentation , the quality of the Wikipedia reference desk is comparable to a standard library reference desk , with an accuracy of 55%. [293]

Mobile access
Wikipedia's original medium was for users to read and edit content using any standard web browser through a fixed Internet connection . Although Wikipedia content has been accessible through the mobile web since July 2013, The New York Times on February 9, 2014, quoted Erik Möller, deputy director of the Wikimedia Foundation, stating that the transition of internet traffic from desktops to mobile devices was significant and a cause for concern and worry. [16] The article in The New York Times reported the comparison statistics for mobile edits stating that, "Only 20 percent of the readership of the English-language Wikipedia comes via mobile devices, a figure substantially lower than the percentage of mobile traffic for other media sites, many of which approach 50 percent. And the shift to mobile editing has lagged even more." [16] The New York Times reports that Möller has assigned "a team of 10 software developers focused on mobile", out of a total of approximately 200 employees working at the Wikimedia Foundation. One principal concern cited by The New York Times for the "worry" is for Wikipedia to effectively address attrition issues with the number of editors which the online encyclopedia attracts to edit and maintain its content in a mobile access environment. [16]
Bloomberg Businessweek reported in July 2014 that Google's Android mobile apps have dominated the largest share of global smartphone shipments for 2013 with 78.6% of market share over their next closest competitor in iOS with 15.2% of the market. [294] At the time of the Tretikov appointment and her posted web interview with Sue Gardner in May 2014, Wikimedia representatives made a technical announcement concerning the number of mobile access systems in the market seeking access to Wikipedia. Directly after the posted web interview, the representatives stated that Wikimedia would be applying an all-inclusive approach to accommodate as many mobile access systems as possible in its efforts for expanding general mobile access, including BlackBerry and the Windows Phone system, making market share a secondary issue. [232] The latest version of the Android app for Wikipedia was released on July 23, 2014, to generally positive reviews, scoring over four of a possible five in a poll of approximately 200,000 users downloading from Google. [295] The latest version for iOS was released on April 3, 2013, to similar reviews. [296]
Access to Wikipedia from mobile phones was possible as early as 2004, through the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP), via the Wapedia service. In June 2007 Wikipedia launched en.mobile.wikipedia.org , an official website for wireless devices. In 2009 a newer mobile service was officially released, [297] located at en.m.wikipedia.org , which caters to more advanced mobile devices such as the iPhone , Android -based devices or WebOS -based devices. Several other methods of mobile access to Wikipedia have emerged. Many devices and applications optimize or enhance the display of Wikipedia content for mobile devices, while some also incorporate additional features such as use of Wikipedia metadata (See Wikipedia:Metadata ), such as geoinformation . [298] [299]
Wikipedia Zero is an initiative of the Wikimedia Foundation to expand the reach of the encyclopedia to the developing countries. [300]
Andrew Lih and Andrew Brown both maintain editing Wikipedia with smart phones is difficult and this discourages new potential contributors. Several years running the number of Wikipedia editors has been falling and Tom Simonite of MIT Technology Review claims the bureaucratic structure and rules are a factor in this. Simonite alleges some Wikipedians use the labyrinthine rules and guidelines to dominate others and those editors have a vested interest in keeping the status quo . [50] Lih alleges there is serious disagreement among existing contributors how to resolve this. Lih fears for Wikipedia's long term future while Brown fears problems with Wikipedia will remain and rival encyclopedias will not replace it. [301] [302]

Cultural impact

Readership
Wikipedia is extremely popular. In February 2014, The New York Times reported that Wikipedia is ranked fifth globally among all websites, stating "With 18 billion page views and nearly 500 million unique visitors a month […] Wikipedia trails just Yahoo, Facebook, Microsoft and Google, the largest with 1.2 billion unique visitors." [16]
In addition to logistic growth in the number of its articles, [303] Wikipedia has steadily gained status as a general reference website since its inception in 2001. [304] About 50% of search engine traffic to Wikipedia comes from Google, [305] a good portion of which is related to academic research. [306] The number of readers of Wikipedia worldwide reached 365 million at the end of 2009. [307] The Pew Internet and American Life project found that one third of US Internet users consulted Wikipedia. [308] In 2011 Business Insider gave Wikipedia a valuation of $4 billion if it ran advertisements. [309]
According to "Wikipedia Readership Survey 2011", the average age of Wikipedia readers is 36, with a rough parity between genders. Almost half of Wikipedia readers visit the site more than five times a month, and a similar number of readers specifically look for Wikipedia in search engine results. About 47% of Wikipedia readers do not realize that Wikipedia is a non-profit organization. [310]

Cultural significance
Wikipedia's content has also been used in academic studies, books, conferences, and court cases. [311] [312] [313] The Parliament of Canada 's website refers to Wikipedia's article on same-sex marriage in the "related links" section of its "further reading" list for the Civil Marriage Act . [314] The encyclopedia's assertions are increasingly used as a source by organizations such as the US federal courts and the World Intellectual Property Organization [315] – though mainly for supporting information rather than information decisive to a case. [316] Content appearing on Wikipedia has also been cited as a source and referenced in some US intelligence agency reports. [317] In December 2008, the scientific journal RNA Biology launched a new section for descriptions of families of RNA molecules and requires authors who contribute to the section to also submit a draft article on the RNA family for publication in Wikipedia. [318]
Wikipedia has also been used as a source in journalism, [319] [320] often without attribution, and several reporters have been dismissed for plagiarizing from Wikipedia. [321] [322] [323]
In 2006, Time magazine recognized Wikipedia's participation (along with YouTube , Reddit , MySpace , and Facebook [324] ) in the rapid growth of online collaboration and interaction by millions of people worldwide.
In July 2007 Wikipedia was the focus of a 30-minute documentary on BBC Radio 4 [325] which argued that, with increased usage and awareness, the number of references to Wikipedia in popular culture is such that the word is one of a select band of 21st-century nouns that are so familiar ( Google , Facebook, YouTube) that they no longer need explanation.
On September 28, 2007, Italian politician Franco Grillini raised a parliamentary question with the minister of cultural resources and activities about the necessity of freedom of panorama . He said that the lack of such freedom forced Wikipedia, "the seventh most consulted website", to forbid all images of modern Italian buildings and art, and claimed this was hugely damaging to tourist revenues. [326]
On September 16, 2007, The Washington Post reported that Wikipedia had become a focal point in the 2008 US election campaign , saying: "Type a candidate's name into Google, and among the first results is a Wikipedia page, making those entries arguably as important as any ad in defining a candidate. Already, the presidential entries are being edited, dissected and debated countless times each day." [327] An October 2007 Reuters article, titled "Wikipedia page the latest status symbol", reported the recent phenomenon of how having a Wikipedia article vindicates one's notability. [328]
Active participation also has an impact. Law students have been assigned to write Wikipedia articles as an exercise in clear and succinct writing for an uninitiated audience. [329]
A working group led by Peter Stone (formed as a part of the Stanford -based project One Hundred Year Study on Artificial Intelligence ) in its report called Wikipedia "the best-known example of crowdsourcing... that far exceeds traditionally-compiled information sources, such as encyclopedias and dictionaries, in scale and depth." [330]

Awards
Wikipedia won two major awards in May 2004. [331] The first was a Golden Nica for Digital Communities of the annual Prix Ars Electronica contest; this came with a €10,000 (£6,588; $12,700) grant and an invitation to present at the PAE Cyberarts Festival in Austria later that year. The second was a Judges' Webby Award for the "community" category. [332] Wikipedia was also nominated for a "Best Practices" Webby award.
In 2007, readers of brandchannel.com voted Wikipedia as the fourth-highest brand ranking, receiving 15% of the votes in answer to the question "Which brand had the most impact on our lives in 2006?" [333]
In September 2008, Wikipedia received Quadriga A Mission of Enlightenment award of Werkstatt Deutschland along with Boris Tadić , Eckart Höfling , and Peter Gabriel . The award was presented to Wales by David Weinberger . [334]
In 2015, Wikipedia was awarded both the annual Erasmus Prize , which recognizes exceptional contributions to culture, society or social sciences, [335] and the Spanish Princess of Asturias Award on International Cooperation. [336] Speaking at the Asturian Parliament in Oviedo, the city that hosts the awards ceremony, Jimmy Wales praised the work of the Asturian language Wikipedia users. [337] The night of the ceremony, members of the Wikimedia Foundation held a meeting with Wikipedians from all parts of Spain, including the local Asturian community .

Satire
Many parodies target Wikipedia's openness and susceptibility to inserted inaccuracies, with characters vandalizing or modifying the online encyclopedia project's articles.
Comedian Stephen Colbert has parodied or referenced Wikipedia on numerous episodes of his show The Colbert Report and coined the related term wikiality , meaning "together we can create a reality that we all agree on—the reality we just agreed on". [177] Another example can be found in "Wikipedia Celebrates 750 Years of American Independence", a July 2006 front-page article in The Onion , [338] as well as the 2010 The Onion article "'L.A. Law' Wikipedia Page Viewed 874 Times Today". [339]
In an episode of the television comedy The Office U.S. , which aired in April 2007, an incompetent office manager ( Michael Scott ) is shown relying on a hypothetical Wikipedia article for information on negotiation tactics in order to assist him in negotiating lesser pay for an employee. [340] The tactics he used failed, as a joke about the unreliability of Wikipedia and what anyone can do to change its contents. Viewers of the show tried to add the episode's mention of the page as a section of the actual Wikipedia article on negotiation, but this effort was prevented by other users on the article's talk page. [341]
" My Number One Doctor ", a 2007 episode of the television show Scrubs , played on the perception that Wikipedia is an unreliable reference tool with a scene in which Dr. Perry Cox reacts to a patient who says that a Wikipedia article indicates that the raw food diet reverses the effects of bone cancer by retorting that the same editor who wrote that article also wrote the Battlestar Galactica episode guide . [342]
In 2008, the comedic website CollegeHumor produced a video sketch named "Professor Wikipedia", in which the fictitious Professor Wikipedia instructs a class with a medley of unverifiable and occasionally absurd statements. [343]
The Dilbert comic strip from May 8, 2009, features a character supporting an improbable claim by saying "Give me ten minutes and then check Wikipedia." [344]
In July 2009, BBC Radio 4 broadcast a comedy series called Bigipedia , which was set on a website which was a parody of Wikipedia. Some of the sketches were directly inspired by Wikipedia and its articles. [345]
In 2010, comedian Daniel Tosh encouraged viewers of his show, Tosh.0 , to visit the show's Wikipedia article and edit it at will. On a later episode, he commented on the edits to the article, most of them offensive, which had been made by the audience and had prompted the article to be locked from editing. [346] [347]
On August 23, 2013, the New Yorker website published a cartoon with this caption: "Dammit, Manning, have you considered the pronoun war that this is going to start on your Wikipedia page?" [348]
In December 2015, John Julius Norwich stated, in a letter published in The Times newspaper, that as an historian he resorted to Wikipedia "at least a dozen times a day", and had never yet caught it out. He described it as "a work of reference as useful as any in existence", with so wide a range that it is almost impossible to find a person, place or thing that it has left uncovered, and that he could never have written his last two books without it. [349] [350]

Sister projects – Wikimedia
Wikipedia has also spawned several sister projects, which are also wikis run by the Wikimedia Foundation . These other Wikimedia projects include Wiktionary , a dictionary project launched in December 2002, [351] Wikiquote , a collection of quotations created a week after Wikimedia launched, Wikibooks , a collection of collaboratively written free textbooks and annotated texts, Wikimedia Commons , a site devoted to free-knowledge multimedia, Wikinews , for citizen journalism, and Wikiversity , a project for the creation of free learning materials and the provision of online learning activities. [352] Another sister project of Wikipedia, Wikispecies , is a catalogue of species. In 2012 Wikivoyage , an editable travel guide, and Wikidata , an editable knowledge base, launched.

Publishing
The most obvious economic effect of Wikipedia has been the death of commercial encyclopedias, especially the printed versions, e.g. Encyclopædia Britannica , which were unable to compete with a product that is essentially free. [353] [354] [355] Nicholas Carr wrote a 2005 essay, "The amorality of Web 2.0 ", that criticized websites with user-generated content , like Wikipedia, for possibly leading to professional (and, in his view, superior) content producers' going out of business, because "free trumps quality all the time". Carr wrote: "Implicit in the ecstatic visions of Web 2.0 is the hegemony of the amateur. I for one can't imagine anything more frightening." [356] Others dispute the notion that Wikipedia, or similar efforts, will entirely displace traditional publications. For instance, Chris Anderson , the editor-in-chief of Wired Magazine , wrote in Nature that the " wisdom of crowds " approach of Wikipedia will not displace top scientific journals , with their rigorous peer review process. [357]
There is also an ongoing debate about the influence of Wikipedia on the biography publishing business. "The worry is that, if you can get all that information from Wikipedia, what's left for biography?" said Kathryn Hughes , professor of life writing at UEA and author of The Short Life and Long Times of Mrs Beeton and George Eliot: the Last Victorian . [358]

Scientific use
Wikipedia has seen been widely used as a corpus for linguistic research in computational linguistics , information retrieval and natural language processing . In particular, it commonly serves as a target knowledge base for the entity linking problem, which is then called "wikification", [359] and to the related problem of word sense disambiguation . [360] Methods similar to wikification can in turn be used to find "missing" links in Wikipedia. [361]
In 2015, French researchers Dr José Lages of the University of Franche-Comté in Besançon and Dima Shepelyansky of Paul Sabatier University in Toulouse published a global university ranking based on Wikipedia scholarly citations. [362] [363] [364] They used PageRank "followed by the number of appearances in the 24 different language editions of Wikipedia (descending order) and the century in which they were founded (ascending order)." [364]

Related projects
A number of interactive multimedia encyclopedias incorporating entries written by the public existed long before Wikipedia was founded. The first of these was the 1986 BBC Domesday Project , which included text (entered on BBC Micro computers) and photographs from over 1 million contributors in the UK, and covered the geography, art, and culture of the UK. This was the first interactive multimedia encyclopedia (and was also the first major multimedia document connected through internal links), with the majority of articles being accessible through an interactive map of the UK. The user interface and part of the content of the Domesday Project were emulated on a website until 2008. [365]
Several free-content, collaborative encyclopedias were created around the same period as Wikipedia (e.g. Everything2 ), [366] with many later being merged into the project (e.g. GNE ). [367] One of the most successful early online encyclopedias incorporating entries by the public was h2g2 , which was created by Douglas Adams in 1999. The h2g2 encyclopedia is relatively light-hearted, focusing on articles which are both witty and informative.
Subsequent collaborative knowledge websites have drawn inspiration from Wikipedia. Some, such as Susning.nu , Enciclopedia Libre , Hudong , and Baidu Baike likewise employ no formal review process, although some like Conservapedia are not as open. Others use more traditional peer review , such as Encyclopedia of Life and the online wiki encyclopedias Scholarpedia and Citizendium . The latter was started by Sanger in an attempt to create a reliable alternative to Wikipedia. [368] [369]

Rodent
Rodents (from Latin rodere , "to gnaw") are mammals of the order Rodentia , which are characterized by a single pair of continuously growing incisors in each of the upper and lower jaws . About 40% of all mammal species are rodents; they are found in vast numbers on all continents except Antarctica . They are the most diversified mammalian order and live in a variety of terrestrial habitats , including human-made environments.
Species can be arboreal , fossorial (burrowing), or semiaquatic. Well-known rodents include mice , rats , squirrels , prairie dogs , porcupines , beavers , guinea pigs , hamsters , gerbils and capybaras . Other animals such as rabbits , hares , and pikas , whose incisors also grow continually, were once included with them, but are now considered to be in a separate order, the Lagomorpha . Nonetheless, Rodentia and Lagomorpha are sister groups , sharing a most recent common ancestor and forming the clade of Glires .
Most rodents are small animals with robust bodies, short limbs, and long tails. They use their sharp incisors to gnaw food, excavate burrows, and defend themselves. Most eat seeds or other plant material, but some have more varied diets. They tend to be social animals and many species live in societies with complex ways of communicating with each other. Mating among rodents can vary from monogamy , to polygyny , to promiscuity . Many have litters of underdeveloped, altricial young, while others are precocial (relatively well developed) at birth.
The rodent fossil record dates back to the Paleocene on the supercontinent of Laurasia . Rodents greatly diversified in the Eocene , as they spread across continents, sometimes even crossing oceans . Rodents reached both South America and Madagascar from Africa, and were the only terrestrial placental mammals to reach and colonize Australia.
Rodents have been used as food, for clothing, as pets, and as laboratory animals in research. Some species, in particular the brown rat , the black rat , and the house mouse , are serious pests , eating and spoiling food stored by humans, and spreading diseases. Accidentally introduced species of rodents are often considered to be invasive , and have caused the extinction of numerous species, such as island birds, previously isolated from land-based predators.

Characteristics
The distinguishing feature of the rodents is their pairs of continuously growing, razor-sharp incisors . [1] These incisors have thick layers of enamel on the front and little enamel on the back. [2] Because they do not stop growing, the animal must continue to wear them down so that they do not reach and pierce the skull. As the incisors grind against each other, the softer dentine on the rear of the teeth wears away, leaving the sharp enamel edge shaped like the blade of a chisel . [3] Most species have up to 22 teeth with no canines or anterior premolars . A gap, or diastema , occurs between the incisors and the cheek teeth in most species. This allows rodents to suck in their cheeks or lips to shield their mouth and throat from wood shavings and other inedible material, discarding this waste from the sides of their mouths. [4] Chinchillas and guinea pigs have a high-fiber diet; their molars have no roots and grow continuously like their incisors. [5]
In many species, the molars are relatively large, intricately structured, and highly cusped or ridged, though some, such as Pseudohydromys , have smaller and simpler ones. Rodent molars are well equipped to grind food into small particles. [1] The jaw musculature is strong. The lower jaw is thrust forward while gnawing and is pulled backwards during chewing. [2] Rodent groups differ in the arrangement of the jaw muscles and associated skull structures, both from other mammals and amongst themselves. The Sciuromorpha , such as the eastern grey squirrel , have a large deep masseter , making them efficient at biting with the incisors. The Myomorpha , such as the brown rat, have enlarged temporalis muscles, making them able to chew powerfully with their molars. The Hystricomorpha , such as the guinea pig, have larger superficial masseter muscles and smaller deep masseter muscles than rats or squirrels, possibly making them less efficient at biting with the incisors, but their enlarged internal pterygoid muscles may allow them to move the jaw further sideways when chewing. [6] The cheek pouch is a specific morphological feature used for storing food and is evident in particular subgroups of rodents like kangaroo rats, hamsters, chipmunks and gophers which have two bags that may range from the mouth to the front of the shoulders. [7] True mice and rats do not contain this structure but their cheeks are elastic due to a high degree of musculature and innervation in the region. [8]
While the largest species, the capybara , can weigh as much as 66 kg (146 lb), most rodents weigh less than 100 g (3.5 oz). The smallest rodent is the Baluchistan pygmy jerboa , which averages only 4.4 cm (1.7 in) in head and body length, with adult females weighing only 3.75 g (0.132 oz). Rodents have wide-ranging morphologies, but typically have squat bodies and short limbs. [1] The fore limbs usually have five digits, including an opposable thumb, while the hind limbs have three to five digits. The elbow gives the fore arms great flexibility. [3] [9] The majority of species are plantigrade , walking on both the palms and soles of their feet, and have claw-like nails. The nails of burrowing species tend to be long and strong, while arboreal rodents have shorter, sharper nails. [9] Rodent species use a wide variety of methods of locomotion including quadrupedal walking, running, burrowing, and climbing, bipedal hopping ( kangaroo rats and hopping mice ), swimming, and even gliding. Scaly-tailed squirrels and flying squirrels , although not closely related, can both glide from tree to tree using parachute-like membranes that stretch from the fore to the hind limbs. [10] The agouti is fleet-footed and antelope -like, being digitigrade and having hoof-like nails. The majority of rodents have tails, which can be of many shapes and sizes. Some tails are prehensile , as in the Eurasian harvest mouse , and the fur on the tails can vary from bushy to completely bald. The tail is sometimes used for communication, as when beavers slap their tails on the water surface or house mice rattle their tails to indicate alarm. Some species have vestigial tails or no tails at all. [1] In some species, the tail is capable of regeneration if a part is broken off. [3]
Rodents generally have well-developed senses of smell , hearing, and vision. Nocturnal species often have enlarged eyes and some are sensitive to ultraviolet light. Many species have long, sensitive whiskers or vibrissae for touch or "whisking" . Some rodents have cheek pouches , which may be lined with fur. These can be turned inside out for cleaning. In many species, the tongue cannot reach past the incisors. Rodents have efficient digestive systems, absorbing nearly 80% of ingested energy. When eating cellulose , the food is softened in the stomach and passed to the cecum , where bacteria reduce it to its carbohydrate elements. The rodent then practices coprophagy , eating its own fecal pellets, so the nutrients can be absorbed by the gut. Rodents therefore often produce a hard and dry fecal pellet. [1] In many species, the penis contains a bone, the baculum ; the testes can be located either abdominally or at the groin. [3]
Sexual dimorphism occurs in many rodent species. In some rodents, males are larger than females, while in others the reverse is true. Male-bias sexual dimorphism is typical for ground squirrels , kangaroo rats, solitary mole rats , and pocket gophers ; it likely developed due to sexual selection and greater male-male combat. Female-bias sexual dimorphism exists among chipmunks and jumping mice . It is not understood why this pattern occurs, but in the case of yellow-pine chipmunks , males may have selected larger females due to their greater reproductive success. In some species, such as voles , sexual dimorphism can vary from population to population. In bank voles , females are typically larger than males, but male-bias sexual dimorphism occurs in alpine populations, possibly because of the lack of predators and greater competition between males. [11]
The diversity of characteristics of rodents is great, sometimes even in closely related species. Characteristics of several rodents are given in the table below. [12]

Distribution and habitat
One of the most widespread groups of mammals, rodents can be found on every continent except Antarctica. They are the only terrestrial placental mammals to have colonized Australia and New Guinea without human intervention. Humans have also allowed the animals to spread to many remote oceanic islands (e.g., the Polynesian rat ). [3] Rodents have adapted to almost every terrestrial habitat, from cold tundra (where they can live under snow) to hot deserts.
Some species such as tree squirrels and New World porcupines are arboreal , while some, such as gophers , tuco-tucos , and mole rats, live almost completely underground, where they build complex burrow systems. Others dwell on the surface of the ground, but may have a burrow into which they can retreat. Beavers and muskrats are known for being semiaquatic, [1] but the rodent best-adapted for aquatic life is probably the earless water rat from New Guinea. [22] Rodents have also thrived in human-created environments such as agricultural and urban areas . [23]
Though some species are common pests for humans, rodents also play important ecological roles. [1] Some rodents are considered keystone species and ecosystem engineers in their respective habitats. In the Great Plains of North America, the burrowing activities of prairie dogs play important roles in soil aeration and nutrient redistribution, raising the organic content of the soil and increasing the absorption of water. They maintain these grassland habitats, [24] and some large herbivores such as bison and pronghorn prefer to graze near prairie dog colonies due to the increased nutritional quality of forage. [25]
Extirpation of prairie dogs can also contribute to regional and local biodiversity loss, increased seed depredation, and the establishment and spread of invasive shrubs. [24] Burrowing rodents may eat the fruiting bodies of fungi and spread spores through their feces, thereby allowing the fungi to disperse and form symbiotic relationships with the roots of plants (which usually cannot thrive without them). As such, these rodents may play a role in maintaining healthy forests. [26]
In many temperate regions, beavers play an essential hydrological role. When building their dams and lodges, beavers alter the paths of streams and rivers [27] and allow for the creation of extensive wetland habitats. One study found that engineering by beavers leads to a 33 percent increase in the number of herbaceous plant species in riparian areas . [28] Another study found that beavers increase wild salmon populations. [29]

Behavior and life history

Feeding
Most rodents are herbivorous , feeding exclusively on plant material such as seeds, stems, leaves, flowers, and roots. Some are omnivorous and a few are predators. [2] The field vole is a typical herbivorous rodent and feeds on grasses, herbs, root tubers, moss, and other vegetation, and gnaws on bark during the winter. It occasionally eats invertebrates such as insect larvae. [30] The plains pocket gopher eats plant material found underground during tunneling, and also collects grasses, roots, and tubers in its cheek pouches and caches them in underground larder chambers. [31]
The Texas pocket gopher avoids emerging onto the surface to feed by seizing the roots of plants with its jaws and pulling them downwards into its burrow. It also practices coprophagy. [32] The African pouched rat forages on the surface, gathering anything that might be edible into its capacious cheek pouches until its face bulges out sideways. It then returns to its burrow to sort through the material it has gathered and eats the nutritious items. [33]
The agouti is one of the few animals that can break open the large capsules of the Brazil nut fruit. Too many seeds are inside to be consumed in one meal, so the agouti carries some off and caches them. This helps dispersal of the seeds as any that the agouti fails to retrieve are distant from the parent tree when they germinate. Other nut-bearing trees tend to bear a glut of fruits in the autumn. These are too numerous to be eaten in one meal and squirrels gather and store the surplus in crevices and hollow trees. In desert regions, seeds are often available only for short periods. The kangaroo rat collects all it can find and stores them in larder chambers in its burrow. [33]
A strategy for dealing with seasonal plenty is to eat as much as possible and store the surplus nutrients as fat. Marmots do this, and may be 50% heavier in the autumn than in the spring. They rely on their fat reserves during their long winter hibernation . [33] Beavers feed on the leaves, buds, and inner bark of growing trees, as well as aquatic plants. They store food for winter use by felling small trees and leafy branches in the autumn and immersing them in their pond, sticking the ends into the mud to anchor them. Here, they can access their food supply underwater even when their pond is frozen over. [34]
Although rodents have been regarded traditionally as herbivores, a number of species opportunistically include insects, fish, or meat in their diets and more specialized forms rely on such foods. A functional-morphological study of the rodent tooth system supports the idea that primitive rodents were omnivores rather than herbivores. Studies of the literature show that numerous members of the Sciuromorpha and Myomorpha, and a few members of the Hystricomorpha, have either included animal matter in their diets or been prepared to eat such food when offered it in captivity. Examination of the stomach contents of the North American white-footed mouse , normally considered to be herbivorous, showed 34% animal matter. [35]
More specialized carnivores include the shrewlike rats of the Philippines, which feed on insects and soft-bodied invertebrates, and the Australian water rat , which devours aquatic insects, fish, crustaceans, mussels, snails, frogs, birds' eggs, and water birds. [35] [36] The grasshopper mouse from dry regions of North America feeds on insects, scorpions, and other small mice, and only a small part of its diet is plant material. It has a chunky body with short legs and tail, but is agile and can easily overpower prey as large as itself. [37]

Social behavior
Rodents exhibit a wide range of types of social behavior ranging from the mammalian caste system of the naked mole-rat , [38] the extensive "town" of the colonial prairie dog , [39] through family groups to the independent, solitary life of the edible dormouse . Adult dormice may have overlapping feeding ranges, but they live in individual nests and feed separately, coming together briefly in the breeding season to mate. The pocket gopher is also a solitary animal outside the breeding season, each individual digging a complex tunnel system and maintaining a territory. [9]
Larger rodents tend to live in family units where parents and their offspring live together until the young disperse. Beavers live in extended family units typically with a pair of adults, this year's kits, the previous year's offspring, and sometimes older young. [40] Brown rats usually live in small colonies with up to six females sharing a burrow and one male defending a territory around the burrow. At high population densities, this system breaks down and males show a hierarchical system of dominance with overlapping ranges. Female offspring remain in the colony while male young disperse. [41] The prairie vole is monogamous and forms a lifelong pair bond. Outside the breeding season, prairie voles live in close proximity with others in small colonies. A male is not aggressive towards other males until he has mated, after which time he defends a territory, a female, and a nest against other males. The pair huddles together, grooms one another, and shares nesting and pup-raising responsibilities. [42]
Among the most social of rodents are the ground squirrels, which typically form colonies based on female kinship, with males dispersing after weaning and becoming nomadic as adults. Cooperation in ground squirrels varies between species and typically includes making alarm calls, defending territories, sharing food, protecting nesting areas, and preventing infanticide. [43] The black-tailed prairie dog forms large towns that may cover many hectares. The burrows do not interconnect, but are excavated and occupied by territorial family groups known as coteries. A coterie often consists of an adult male, three or four adult females, several nonbreeding yearlings, and the current year's offspring. Individuals within coteries are friendly with each other, but hostile towards outsiders. [39]
Perhaps the most extreme examples of colonial behavior in rodents are the eusocial naked mole rat and Damaraland mole rat . The naked mole rat lives completely underground and can form colonies of up to 80 individuals. Only one female and up to three males in the colony reproduce, while the rest of the members are smaller and sterile, and function as workers. Some individuals are of intermediate size. They help with the rearing of the young and can take the place of a reproductive if one dies. [44] The Damaraland mole rat is characterized by having a single reproductively active male and female in a colony where the remaining animals are not truly sterile, but become fertile only if they establish a colony of their own. [45]

Communication

Olfactory
Rodents use scent marking in many social contexts including inter- and intra-species communication, the marking of trails and the establishment of territories. Their urine provides genetic information about individuals including the species, the sex and individual identity, and metabolic information on dominance, reproductive status and health. Compounds derived from the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) are bound to several urinary proteins. The odor of a predator depresses scent-marking behavior. [46]
Rodents are able to recognize close relatives by smell and this allows them to show nepotism (preferential behavior toward their kin) and also avoid inbreeding. This kin recognition is by olfactory cues from urine, feces and glandular secretions. The main assessment may involve the MHC, where the degree of relatedness of two individuals is correlated to the MHC genes they have in common. In non-kin communication, where more permanent odor markers are required, as at territorial borders, then non-volatile major urinary proteins (MUPs), which function as pheromone transporters, may also be used. MUPs may also signal individual identity, with each male house mouse ( Mus musculus ) excreting urine containing about a dozen genetically encoded MUPs. [47]
House mice deposit urine, which contains pheromones, for territorial marking, individual and group recognition, and social organization. This can occur in a range of ways: [48]
Territorial beavers and red squirrels investigate and become familiar with the scents of their neighbors and respond less aggressively to intrusions by them than to those made by non-territorial "floaters" or strangers. This is known as the " dear enemy effect ". [49] [50]

Auditory
Many rodent species, particularly those that are diurnal and social, have a wide range of alarm calls that are emitted when they perceive threats. There are both direct and indirect benefits of doing this. A potential predator may stop when it knows it has been detected, or an alarm call can allow conspecifics or related individuals to take evasive action. [51] Several species, for example prairie dogs, have complex anti-predator alarm call systems. These species may have different calls for different predators (e.g. aerial predators or ground-based predators) and each call contains information about the nature of the precise threat. [52] The urgency of the threat is also conveyed by the acoustic properties of the call. [53]
Social rodents have a wider range of vocalizations than do solitary species. Fifteen different call-types have been recognized in adult Kataba mole rats and four in juveniles. [54] Similarly, the degu , another social, burrowing rodent, exhibits a wide array of communication methods and has an elaborate vocal repertoire comprising fifteen different categories of sound. [55] Ultrasonic calls play a part in social communication between dormice and are used when the individuals are out of sight of each other. [56]
House mice use both audible and ultrasonic calls in a variety of contexts. Audible vocalizations can often be heard during agonistic or aggressive encounters, whereas ultrasound is used in sexual communication and also by pups when they have fallen out of the nest. [48]
Laboratory rats (which are brown rats, Rattus norvegicus ) emit short, high frequency, ultrasonic vocalizations during purportedly pleasurable experiences such as rough-and-tumble play, when anticipating routine doses of morphine , during mating, and when tickled. The vocalization, described as a distinct "chirping", has been likened to laughter , and is interpreted as an expectation of something rewarding. In clinical studies, the chirping is associated with positive emotional feelings, and social bonding occurs with the tickler, resulting in the rats becoming conditioned to seek the tickling. However, as the rats age, the tendency to chirp declines. Like most rat vocalizations, the chirping is at frequencies too high for humans to hear without special equipment, so bat detectors have been used for this purpose. [57]
It has been reported that brown rats use ultrasound for echolocation . [48] The frequencies heard by rodents differ between species. The table below shows the hearing ranges of several species. [58]

Visual
Rodents, like all placental mammals except primates, have just two types of light receptive cones in their retina, [59] a short wavelength "blue-UV" type and a middle wavelength "green" type. They are therefore classified as dichromats ; however, they are visually sensitive into the ultraviolet (UV) spectrum and therefore can see light that humans can not. The functions of this UV sensitivity are not always clear. In degus , for example, the belly reflects more UV light than the back. Therefore, when a degu stands up on its hind legs, which it does when alarmed, it exposes its belly to other degus and ultraviolet vision may serve a purpose in communicating the alarm. When it stands on all fours, its low UV-reflectance back could help make the degu less visible to predators. [60] Ultraviolet light is abundant during the day but not at night. There is a large increase in the ratio of ultraviolet to visible light in the morning and evening twilight hours. Many rodents are active during twilight hours (crepuscular activity), and UV-sensitivity would be advantageous at these times. Ultraviolet reflectivity is of dubious value for nocturnal rodents. [61]
The urine of many rodents (e.g. voles, degus, mice, rats) strongly reflects UV light and this may be used in communication by leaving visible as well as olfactory markings. [62] However, the amount of UV that is reflected decreases with time, which in some circumstances can be disadvantageous; the common kestrel can distinguish between old and fresh rodent trails and has greater success hunting over more recently marked routes. [63]

Tactile
Vibrations can provide cues to conspecifics about specific behaviors being performed, predator warning and avoidance, herd or group maintenance, and courtship. The Middle East blind mole rat was the first mammal for which Seismic communication was documented. These fossorial rodents bang their head against the walls of their tunnels. This behavior was initially interpreted as part of their tunnel building behavior, but it was eventually realized that they generate temporally patterned seismic signals for long-distance communication with neighboring mole rats. [64]
Footdrumming is used widely as a predator warning or defensive action. It is used primarily by fossorial or semi-fossorial rodents. [65] The banner-tailed kangaroo rat produces several complex footdrumming patterns in a number of different contexts, one of which is when it encounters a snake. The footdrumming may alert nearby offspring but most likely conveys that the rat is too alert for a successful attack, thus preventing the snake's predatory pursuit. [64] [66] Several studies have indicated intentional use of ground vibrations as a means of intra-specific communication during courtship among the Cape mole rat . [67] Footdrumming has been reported to be involved in male-male competition; the dominant male indicates its resource holding potential by drumming, thus minimizing physical contact with potential rivals. [64]

Mating strategies
Some species of rodent are monogamous, with an adult male and female forming a lasting pair bond . Monogamy can come in two forms; obligate and facultative. In obligate monogamy, both parents care for the offspring and play an important part in their survival. This occurs in species such as California mice , oldfield mice , Malagasy giant rats and beavers. In these species, males usually mate only with their partners. In addition to increased care for young, obligate monogamy can also be beneficial to the adult male as it decreases the chances of never finding a mate or mating with an infertile female. In facultative monogamy, the males do not provide direct parental care and stay with one female because they cannot access others due to being spatially dispersed. Prairie voles appear to be an example of this form of monogamy, with males guarding and defending females within their vicinity. [68]
In polygynous species, males will try to monopolize and mate with multiple females. As with monogamy, polygyny in rodents can come in two forms; defense and non-defense. Defense polygyny involves males controlling territories that contain resources that attract females. This occurs in ground squirrels like yellow-bellied marmots , California ground squirrels , Columbian ground squirrels and Richardson's ground squirrels . Males with territories are known as "resident" males and the females that live within the territories are known as "resident" females. In the case of marmots, resident males do not appear to ever lose their territories and always win encounters with invading males. Some species are also known to directly defend their resident females and the ensuing fights can lead to severe wounding. In species with non-defense polygyny, males are not territorial and wander widely in search of females to monopolize. These males establish dominance hierarchies, with the high-ranking males having access to the most females. This occurs in species like Belding's ground squirrels and some tree squirrel species. [68]
Promiscuity , in which both males and females mate with multiple partners, also occurs in rodents. In species such as the white-footed mouse, females give birth to litters with multiple paternities. Promiscuity leads to increased sperm competition and males tend to have larger testicles. In the Cape ground squirrel , the male's testes can be 20 percent of its head-body length. [68] Several rodent species have flexible mating systems that can vary between monogamy, polygyny and promiscuity. [68]
Female rodents play an active role in choosing their mates. Factors that contribute to female preference may include the size, dominance and spatial ability of the male. [69] In the eusocial naked mole rats, a single female monopolizes mating from at least three males. [44]
In most rodent species, such as brown rats and house mice, ovulation occurs on a regular cycle while in others, such as voles, it is induced by mating . During copulation, males of some rodent species deposit a mating plug in the female's genital opening, both to prevent sperm leakage and to protect against other males inseminating the female. Females can remove the plug and may do so either immediately or after several hours. [69]

Birth and parenting
Rodents may be born either altricial (blind, hairless and relatively underdeveloped) or precocial (mostly furred, eyes open and fairly developed) depending on the species. The altricial state is typical for squirrels and mice, while the precocial state usually occurs in species like guinea pigs and porcupines. Females with altricial young typically build elaborate nests before they give birth and maintain them until their offspring are weaned . The female gives birth sitting or lying down and the young emerge in the direction she is facing. The newborns first venture out of the nest a few days after they have opened their eyes and initially keep returning regularly. As they get older and more developed, they visit the nest less often and leave permanently when weaned. [70]
In precocial species, the mothers invest little in nest building and some do not build nests at all. The female gives birth standing and the young emerge behind her. Mothers of these species maintain contact with their highly mobile young with maternal contact calls. Though relatively independent and weaned within days, precocial young may continue to nurse and be groomed by their mothers. Rodent litter sizes also vary and females with smaller litters spend more time in the nest than those with larger litters. [70]
Mother rodents provide both direct parental care, such as nursing, grooming, retrieving and huddling, and indirect parenting, such as food caching, nest building and protection to their offspring. [70] In many social species, young may be cared for by individuals other then their parents, a practice known as alloparenting or cooperative breeding . This is known to occur in black-tailed prairie dogs and Belding's ground squirrels, where mothers have communal nests and nurse unrelated young along with their own. There is some question as to whether these mothers can distinguish which young are theirs. In the Patagonian mara , young are also placed in communal warrens, but mothers do not permit youngsters other than their own to nurse. [71]
Infanticide exists in numerous rodent species and may be practiced by adult conspecifics of either sex. Several reasons have been proposed for this behavior, including nutritional stress, resource competition, avoiding misdirecting parental care and, in the case of males, attempting to make the mother sexually receptive. The latter reason is well supported in primates and lions but less so in rodents. [72] Infanticide appears to be widespread in black-tailed prairie dogs, including infanticide from invading males and immigrant females, as well as occasional cannibalism of an individual's own offspring. [73] To protect against infanticide from other adults, female rodents may employ avoidance or direct aggression against potential perpetrators, multiple mating, territoriality or early termination of pregnancy. [72] Feticide can also occur among rodents; in Alpine marmots , dominant females tend to suppress the reproduction of subordinates by being antagonistic towards them while they are pregnant. The resulting stress causes the fetuses to abort. [74]

Cognition
Rodents have advanced cognitive abilities. They can quickly learn to avoid poisoned baits, which makes them difficult pests to deal with. [1] Guinea pigs can learn and remember complex pathways to food. [75] Squirrels and kangaroo rats are able to locate caches of food by spatial memory , rather than just by smell. [76] [77]
Because laboratory mice (house mice) and rats (brown rats) are widely used as scientific models to further our understanding of biology, a great deal has come to be known about their cognitive capacities. Brown rats exhibit cognitive bias , where information processing is biased by whether they are in a positive or negative affective state. [78] For example, laboratory rats trained to respond to a specific tone by pressing a lever to receive a reward, and to press another lever in response to a different tone so as to avoid receiving an electric shock, are more likely to respond to an intermediate tone by choosing the reward lever if they have just been tickled (something they enjoy), indicating "a link between the directly measured positive affective state and decision making under uncertainty in an animal model." [79]
Laboratory (brown) rats may have the capacity for metacognition —to consider their own learning and then make decisions based on what they know, or do not know, as indicated by choices they make apparently trading off difficulty of tasks and expected rewards, making them the first animals other than primates to have this capacity, [80] [81] but these findings are disputed, since the rats may have been following simple operant conditioning principles, [82] or a behavioral economic model. [83]
Brown rats use social learning in a wide range of situations, but perhaps especially so in acquiring food preferences. Learning about suitable foods can be divided into four life stages. [84] [85]

Classification and evolution

Evolutionary history
Dentition is the key feature by which fossil rodents are recognized and the earliest record of such mammals comes from the Paleocene , shortly after the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs some 66 million years ago. These fossils are found in Laurasia , [86] the supercontinent composed of modern-day North America, Europe, and Asia. The divergence of Glires , a clade consisting of rodents and lagomorphs (rabbits, hares and pikas), from other placental mammals occurred within a few million years after the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary; rodents and lagomorphs then radiated during the Cenozoic . [87] Some molecular clock data suggest modern rodents (members of the order Rodentia) had appeared by the late Cretaceous , although other molecular divergence estimations are in agreement with the fossil record. [88] [89]
Rodents are thought to have evolved in Asia, where local multituberculate faunas were severely affected by the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event and never fully recovered, unlike their North American and European relatives. In the resulting ecological vacuum, rodents and other Glires were allowed to evolve and diversify, taking the niches left by extinct multituberculates. The correlation between the spread of rodents and the demise of multituberculates is a controversial topic, not fully resolved. American and European multituberculate assemblages do decline in diversity in correlation with the introduction of rodents in these areas, but the remaining Asian multituberculates co-existed with rodents with no observable replacement taking place, and ultimately both clades co-existed for at least 15 million years. [90]
The history of the colonization of the world's continents by rodents is complex. The movements of the large superfamily Muroidea (including hamsters , gerbils , true mice and rats ) may have involved up to seven colonizations of Africa, five of North America, four of Southeast Asia, two of South America and up to ten of Eurasia. [91]
During the Eocene , rodents began to diversify. Beavers appeared in North America in the late Eocene before spreading to Eurasia. [93] Late in the Eocene, hystricognaths invaded Africa, most probably having originated in Asia at least 39.5 million years ago. [94] From Africa, fossil evidence shows that some hystricognaths ( caviomorphs ) colonized South America , which was an isolated continent at the time, evidently making use of ocean currents to cross the Atlantic on floating debris . [95] Caviomorphs had arrived in South America by 41 million years ago (implying a date at least as early as this for hystricognaths in Africa), [94] and had reached the Greater Antilles by the early Oligocene , suggesting that they must have dispersed rapidly across South America. [96]
Nesomyid rodents are thought to have rafted from Africa to Madagascar 20–24 million years ago. [97] All 27 species of native Malagasy rodents appear to be descendents of a single colonization event.
By 20 million years ago, fossils recognizably belonging to the current families such as Muridae had emerged. [86] By the Miocene , when Africa had collided with Asia, African rodents such as the porcupine began to spread into Eurasia . [98] Some fossil species were very large in comparison to modern rodents and included the giant beaver, Castoroides ohioensis , which grew to a length of 2.5 m (8 ft 2 in) and weight of 100 kg (220 lb). [99] The largest known rodent was Josephoartigasia monesi , a pacarana with an estimated body length of 3 m (10 ft). [100]
The first rodents arrived in Australia via Indonesia around 5 million years ago. Although marsupials are the most prominent mammals in Australia, many rodents , all belonging to the subfamily Murinae , are among the continent's mammal species . [101] There are about fifty species of 'old endemics', the first wave of rodents to colonize the country in the Miocene and early Pliocene , and eight true rat ( Rattus ) species of 'new endemics', arriving in a subsequent wave in the late Pliocene or early Pleistocene . The earliest fossil rodents in Australia have a maximum age of 4.5 million years, [102] and molecular data is consistent with the colonization of New Guinea from the west during the late Miocene or early Pliocene followed by rapid diversification. A further wave of adaptive radiation occurred after one or more colonizations of Australia some 2 to 3 million years later. [103]
Rodents participated in the Great American Interchange that resulted from the joining of the Americas by formation of the Isthmus of Panama , around 3 million years ago in the Piacenzian age. [104] In this exchange, a small number of species such as the New World porcupines (Erethizontidae) headed north. [86] However, the main southward invasion of sigmodontines preceded formation of the land bridge by at least several million years, probably occurring via rafting. [105] [106] [107] Sigmodontines diversified explosively once in South America, although some degree of diversification may have already occurred in Central America before the colonization. [106] [107] Their "head start" has relegated other North American rodent groups (sciurids, geomyids, heteromyids and nonsigmodontine cricetids) to a minor presence in the contemporary South American fauna.

Standard classification
The use of the order name "Rodentia" is attributed to the English traveler and naturalist Thomas Edward Bowdich (1821). [108] The Modern Latin word "Rodentia" is derived from "rodens", present participle of "rodere" – "to gnaw", "eat away". [109] The hares , rabbits and pikas (order Lagomorpha) have continuously growing incisors, as do rodents, and were at one time included in the order. However, they have an additional pair of incisors in the upper jaw and the two orders have quite separate evolutionary histories. [110] The phylogeny of the rodents places them in the clades Glires, Euarchontoglires and Boreoeutheria . The cladogram below shows the inner and outer relations of Rodentia based on a 2012 attempt by Wu et al. to align the molecular clock with paleontological data: [111]
The living rodent families based on the study done by Fabre et al. 2012. [112]
The order Rodentia may be divided into suborders , infraorders , superfamilies and families . There is a great deal of parallelism and convergence among rodents caused by the fact that they have tended to evolve to fill largely similar niches. This parallel evolution includes not only the structure of the teeth, but also the infraorbital region of the skull (below the eye socket) and makes classification difficult as similar traits may not be due to common ancestry. [113] [114] Brandt (1855) was the first to propose dividing Rodentia into three suborders, Sciuromorpha, Hystricomorpha and Myomorpha, based on the development of certain muscles in the jaw and this system was widely accepted. Schlosser (1884) performed a comprehensive review of rodent fossils, mainly using the cheek teeth, and found that they fitted into the classical system, but Tullborg (1899) proposed just two sub-orders, Sciurognathi and Hystricognathi. These were based on the degree of inflection of the lower jaw and were to be further subdivided into Sciuromorpha, Myomorpha, Hystricomorpha and Bathyergomorpha. Matthew (1910) created a phylogenetic tree of New World rodents but did not include the more problematic Old World species. Further attempts at classification continued without agreement, with some authors adopting the classical three suborder system and others Tullborg's two suborders. [113]
These disagreements remain unresolved, nor have molecular studies fully resolved the situation though they have confirmed the monophyly of the group and that the clade has descended from a common Paleocene ancestor. Carleton and Musser (2005) in Mammal Species of the World have provisionally adopted a five suborder system: Sciuromorpha, Castorimorpha, Myomorpha, Anomaluromorpha, and Hystricomorpha. These include 33 families, 481 genera and 2277 species: [115] [116]

Interaction with humans

Conservation
While rodents are not the most seriously threatened order of mammals, there are 168 species in 126 genera that are said to warrant conservation attention [117] in the face of limited appreciation by the public. Since 76 percent of rodent genera contain only one species, much phylogenetic diversity could be lost with a comparatively small number of extinctions. In the absence of more detailed knowledge of species at risk and accurate taxonomy, conservation must be based mainly on higher taxa (such as families rather than species) and geographical hot spots. [117] Several species of rice rat have become extinct since the 19th century, probably through habitat loss and the introduction of alien species. [118] In Colombia, the brown hairy dwarf porcupine was recorded from only two mountain localities in the 1920s, while the red crested soft-furred spiny rat is known only from its type locality on the Caribbean coast, so these species are considered vulnerable. [119] The IUCN Species Survival Commission writes "We can safely conclude that many South American rodents are seriously threatened, mainly by environmental disturbance and intensive hunting". [120]
The "three now cosmopolitan commensal rodent pest species" [121] (the brown rat, the black rat and the house mouse) have been dispersed in association with humans, partly on sailing ships in the Age of Exploration , and with a fourth species in the Pacific, the Polynesian rat ( Rattus exulans ), have severely damaged island biotas around the world. For example, when the black rat reached Lord Howe Island in 1918, over 40 percent of the terrestrial bird species of the island, including the Lord Howe fantail , [122] became extinct within ten years. Similar destruction has been seen on Midway Island (1943) and Big South Cape Island (1962). Conservation projects can with careful planning completely eradicate these pest rodents from islands using an anticoagulant rodenticide such as brodifacoum . [121] This approach has been successful on the island of Lundy in the United Kingdom, where the eradication of an estimated 40,000 brown rats is giving populations of Manx shearwater and Atlantic puffin a chance to recover from near-extinction. [123] [124]

Exploitation
Humanity has long used animal skins for clothing, as the leather is durable and the fur provides extra insulation. [2] The native people of North America made much use of beaver pelts, tanning and sewing them together to make robes. Europeans appreciated the quality of these and the North American fur trade developed and became of prime importance to early settlers. In Europe, the soft underfur known as "beaver wool" was found to be ideal for felting and was made into beaver hats and trimming for clothing. [125] [126] Later, the coypu took over as a cheaper source of fur for felting and was farmed extensively in America and Europe; however, fashions changed, new materials became available and this area of the animal fur industry declined. [127] The chinchilla has a soft and silky coat and the demand for its fur was so high that it was nearly wiped out in the wild before farming took over as the main source of pelts. [127] The quills and guardhairs of porcupines are used for traditional decorative clothing. For example, their guardhairs are used in the creation of the Native American "porky roach" headdress. The main quills may be dyed, and then applied in combination with thread to embellish leather accessories such as knife sheaths and leather bags. Lakota women would harvest the quills for quillwork by throwing a blanket over a porcupine and retrieving the quills it left stuck in the blanket. [128]
At least 89 species of rodent, mostly Hystricomorpha such as guinea pigs, agoutis and capybaras, are eaten by humans; in 1985, there were at least 42 different societies in which people eat rats. [129] Guinea pigs were first raised for food around 2500 B.C. and by 1500 B.C. had become the main source of meat for the Inca Empire . Dormice were raised by the Romans in special pots called "gliraria", or in large outdoor enclosures, where they were fattened on walnuts, chestnuts, and acorns. The dormice were also caught from the wild in autumn when they were fattest, and either roasted and dipped into honey or baked while stuffed with a mixture of pork, pine nuts, and other flavorings. Researchers found that in Amazonia, where large mammals were scarce, pacas and common agoutis accounted for around 40 percent of the annual game taken by the indigenous people, but in forested areas where larger mammals were abundant, these rodents constituted only about 3 percent of the take. [129]
Guinea pigs are used in the cuisine of Cuzco , Peru, in dishes such as cuy al horno , baked guinea pig. [2] [130] The traditional Andean stove, known as a qoncha or a fogón , is made from mud and clay reinforced with straw and hair from animals such as guinea pigs. [131] In Peru, there are at any time 20 million domestic guinea pigs, which annually produce 64 million edible carcasses. This animal is an excellent food source since the flesh is 19% protein. [129] In the United States, mostly squirrels, but also muskrats, porcupines, and ground hogs are eaten by humans. The Navajo people ate prairie dog baked in mud, while the Paiute ate gophers, squirrels, and rats. [129]
Rodents including guinea pigs, [132] mice, rats, hamsters, gerbils, chinchillas, degus and chipmunks make convenient pets able to live in small spaces, each species with its own qualities. [133] Most are normally kept in cages of suitable sizes and have varied requirements for space and social interaction. If handled from a young age, they are usually docile and do not bite. Guinea pigs have a long lifespan and need a large cage. [75] Rats also need plenty of space and can become very tame, can learn tricks and seem to enjoy human companionship. Mice are short-lived but take up very little space. Hamsters are solitary but tend to be nocturnal. They have interesting behaviors, but unless handled regularly they may be defensive. Gerbils are not usually aggressive, rarely bite and are sociable animals that enjoy the company of humans and their own kind. [134]
Rodents are used widely as model organisms in animal testing. [2] [135] Albino mutant rats were first used for research in 1828 and later became the first animal domesticated for purely scientific purposes. [136] Nowadays, the house mouse is the most commonly used laboratory rodent, and in 1979 it was estimated that fifty million were used annually worldwide. They are favored because of their small size, fertility, short gestation period and ease of handling and because they are susceptible to many of the conditions and infections that afflict humans. They are used in research into genetics , developmental biology , cell biology , oncology and immunology . [137] Guinea pigs were popular laboratory animals until the late 20th century; about 2.5 million guinea pigs were used annually in the United States for research in the 1960s, [138] but that total decreased to about 375,000 by the mid-1990s. [139] In 2007, they constituted about 2% of all laboratory animals. [138] Guinea pigs played a major role in the establishment of germ theory in the late 19th century, through the experiments of Louis Pasteur , Émile Roux , and Robert Koch . [140] They have been launched into orbital space flight several times—first by the USSR on the Sputnik 9 biosatellite of March 9, 1961, with a successful recovery. [141] The naked mole rat is the only known mammal that is poikilothermic ; it is used in studies on thermoregulation . It is also unusual in not producing the neurotransmitter substance P , a fact which researchers find useful in studies on pain . [142]
Rodents have sensitive olfactory abilities, which have been used by humans to detect odors or chemicals of interest. [143] The Gambian pouched rat is able to detect tuberculosis bacilli with a sensitivity of up to 86.6%, and specificity (detecting the absence of the bacilli) of over 93%; the same species has been trained to detect land mines . [144] [145] Rats have been studied for possible use in hazardous situations such as in disaster zones. They can be trained to respond to commands, which may be given remotely, and even persuaded to venture into brightly lit areas, which rats usually avoid. [146] [147] [148]

As pests and disease vectors
Some rodent species are serious agricultural pests , eating large quantities of food stored by humans. [149] For example, in 2003, the amount of rice lost to mice and rats in Asia was estimated to be enough to feed 200 million people. Most of the damage worldwide is caused by a relatively small number of species, chiefly rats and mice. [150] In Indonesia and Tanzania, rodents reduce crop yields by around fifteen percent, while in some instances in South America losses have reached ninety percent. Across Africa, rodents including Mastomys and Arvicanthis damage cereals, groundnuts, vegetables and cacao. In Asia, rats, mice and species such as Microtus brandti , Meriones unguiculatus and Eospalax baileyi damage crops of rice, sorghum, tubers, vegetables and nuts. In Europe, as well as rats and mice, species of Apodemus , Microtus and in occasional outbreaks Arvicola terrestris cause damage to orchards, vegetables and pasture as well as cereals. In South America, a wider range of rodent species, such as Holochilus , Akodon , Calomys , Oligoryzomys , Phyllotis , Sigmodon and Zygodontomys , damage many crops including sugar cane, fruits, vegetables, and tubers. [150]
Rodents are also significant vectors of disease. [151] The black rat, with the fleas that it carries , plays a primary role in spreading the bacterium Yersinia pestis responsible for bubonic plague , [152] and carries the organisms responsible for typhus , Weil's disease , toxoplasmosis and trichinosis . [153] A number of rodents carry hantaviruses , including the Puumala , Dobrava and Saaremaa viruses , which can infect humans. [154] Rodents also help to transmit diseases including babesiosis , cutaneous leishmaniasis , human granulocytic anaplasmosis , Lyme disease , Omsk hemorrhagic fever , Powassan virus , rickettsialpox , relapsing fever , Rocky Mountain spotted fever , and West Nile virus . [155]
Because rodents are a nuisance and endanger public health , human societies often attempt to control them. Traditionally, this involved poisoning and trapping, methods that were not always safe or effective. More recently, integrated pest management attempts to improve control with a combination of surveys to determine the size and distribution of the pest population, the establishment of tolerance limits (levels of pest activity at which to intervene), interventions, and evaluation of effectiveness based on repeated surveys. Interventions may include education, making and applying laws and regulations, modifying the habitat, changing farming practices, and biological control using pathogens or predators , as well as poisoning and trapping. [156] The use of pathogens such as Salmonella has the drawback that they can infect man and domestic animals, and rodents often become resistant. The use of predators including ferrets , mongooses and monitor lizards has been found unsatisfactory. Domestic and feral cats are able to control rodents effectively, provided the rodent population is not too large. [157] In the UK, two species in particular, the house mouse and the brown rat, are actively controlled to limit damage in growing crops, loss and contamination of stored crops and structural damage to facilities, as well as to comply with the law. [158]

Interorbital region
The interorbital region of the skull is located between the eyes , anterior to the braincase . The form of the interorbital region may exhibit significant variation between taxonomic groups.
In oryzomyine rodents , for example, the width, form, and presence of beading in the interorbital region vary among species. In birds and many other animals whose eyes are set on the side of the skull, the interorbital region normally consists of a thin interorbital septum only. This may be pierced by a hole of larger or smaller size, connecting the eye sockets .

St. Laurentii, Itzehoe
The church St. Laurentii is the parish church of a Lutheran congregation in the centre of Itzehoe , Schleswig-Holstein , Germany. The full name is Stadtkirche St. Laurentii (town church of Lawrence of Rome ). Completed in 1718, it is the town's largest religious building. It serves as a parish church and as a concert venue.

History
A church dedicated to St. Laurentius was first mentioned in a document from 1196. [1] It was a Gothic hall church with two naves, which was destroyed when the town burnt in 1657 due to the Second Northern War . The church was rebuilt only provisionally. The cloisters survived and are the only medieval building left in Itzehoe.
The present church was built from 1716 to 1718 in Baroque style . [1] The tower was first only slightly higher than the church. The present tower was built from 1894 to 1896 after designs by Johannes Otzen . It is 79.45 metres (260.7 ft) high, crowned with an onion dome and four corner towers, and was equipped with a viewing platform. The tower was severely damaged by a storm on 8 January 2002. The restoration was completed in 2005. [2]
Below the church, ladies ( Stiftsdamen ) of the Itzehoe Abbey ( de ) and members of the noble family of Rantzau were buried in metal sarcophages, including: [3]

Furnishing
Most pieces date back to the time between the burning and the new church, including an altar from the workshop of Hein Baxmann ( de ) , a wood carver from Hamburg who created 24 biblical scenes, and the chancel, which was until 1962 in the centre of a rood screen . [1]

Church music
The organ was begun in 1715 by Arp Schnitger . [1] After his death in 1719, his pupil Lambert Daniel Kastens ( de ) completed the work. The Schnitger organ was replaced in 1905 by an instrument built by Wilhelm Sauer who retained the case ( Prospekt ). Franz Grollmann rebuilt and expanded the organ in 1976. [4] The church is a venue of the Schleswig-Holstein Musik Festival and other concerts. [5]

Biography

Early years
Howard was born on September 2, 1798, in Bandon, County Cork in the Republic of Ireland , the son of John Howard and Mary Scot. He left Ireland in 1819 and briefly settled in Fredericton, New Brunswick where he married, before moving to York in 1820. He was the son-in-law of Archibald McLean . [1] [2] Shortly after arriving in York, he was appointed to the staff of the First Toronto Post Office , where he worked under William Allan. On July 2, 1828, he succeeded Allan as postmaster of the Town of York, [3] a "plum position" in a colonial capital. His annual salary in the position of Postmaster was 713 pounds . He reported to Thomas Stayner, the Deputy Postmaster General for British North America stationed in Quebec City . The postmaster of York was the unofficial Deputy Postmaster General for Upper Canada, the most important postal official in the colony. To the residents of York, being a British and very Anglican town, having an Irish Methodist in this position caused him to be viewed with wariness by some. Howard moved his family north to an area close to Yonge St and St. Clair Avenue. The move freed up his former living space in the post office, allowing it to expand. He would commute to the post office on horseback. [4]
During this busy time, Stayner offered Howard the newly created position of Post Office Surveyor of Upper Canada. Having recently relocated his family and happy with his job in Toronto, he declined the position ( Charles Albert Berczy would accept the position). This decision would have "dire consequences" for Howard in the future. [4] Amid the tension surrounding the Rebellion and growing suspicious, Howard wrote to Berczy asking for an investigation on December 9, 1837. He was assured that there was nothing against him except that he had associated too much with "those people" (the rebels); however, he was removed from his post by Lieutenant Governor Francis Bond Head on December 13, 1837, much to his surprise. Howard would learn from Thomas Stayner in January 1838 that Governor Head suspected him "of compliance with the aims and plans of the rebels" because of prior contact he had with John and Joseph Lesslie and that fact that he mostly appointed revolutionary party sympathizers to the Toronto post office. Howard did not take up arms against the rebels, further reinforcing Head's doubts about him. Howard tried to answer the accusations against him by stressing his political neutrality and explaining that as postmaster he had never voted nor attended a political meeting. He was never asked to leave his post and take up arms. Despite this, Head wanted a "zealously loyal man" in charge of the post office and he was unable to understand nor tolerate Howard's neutrality. [3] Howard also refused to open mail of suspected rebels before the 1837 uprising, further infuriating his superiors. [4]
Howard's case was brought before Lord Glenelg , the colonial secretary in February 1838. Glenelg consulted both Bond Head and his successor, George Arthur ; Head stood firm in his position; though Arthur agreed, he did obtain a report from the Executive Council in May 1838, signed by Robert Baldwin Sullivan, Allan, and Augustus Baldwin. Although supporting Howard's political neutrality, it upheld Head's action to dismiss Howard. Lord Glenelg chose not to act and would let the matter rest. [3] During the Rebellion, William Lyon Mackenzie entered Howard's house, harassed his wife, and commandeered provisions for the rebel troops. [3]
After Howard's wrongful dismissal, postal operations were moved in 1839 to a location at Front and Yonge Streets in Toronto. [5]

Later years
After losing his job at the Post Office, he was employed as Treasurer of the Home District from 1842–1866, also serving as Secretary of the Upper Canada Bible Society and serving on the Board of Education from 1846 to his death in 1866. [1] [2]
Howard was granted a coat of arms on January 23, 1857, bearing the motto "PRO FIDE" by Letters Patent . [6] At the time of issuance, Howard was a Justice of the Peace and the Treasurer of the United Counties of York and Peel. [7]
Howard died on March 1, 1866, in Toronto, Canada West. [3]

Legacy
His firing has been called "the best documented drama of the 1837 Rebellion" by one source. [8] Another source explains "Ultimately, the shadowy prejudices and self-interest of the ruling colonial elite, the Family Compact , conspired to deny justice to a man not part of the in-crowd. He fought and fought and fought for a year and a half, and eventually lost his house and his farm." [9]

Mataram Sultanate
The Sultanate of Mataram / m ə ˈ t ɑːr əm / was the last major independent Javanese kingdom on Java before the island was colonised by the Dutch. It was the dominant political force radiating from the interior Central Java from the late 16th century until the beginning of the 18th century. [1]
Mataram reached its peak of power during the reign of Sultan Agung Hanyokrokusumo ( r. 1613 – 1645 ), and began to decline after his death in 1645. By the mid-18th century, Mataram lost both power and territory to the Dutch East India Company (Dutch: Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie ; VOC ). It had become a vassal state of the company by 1749.

Etymology
The name Mataram itself was never the official name of any polity, as the Javanese often refer to their realm simply as Bhumi Jawa or Tanah Jawi ("Land of Java"). Mataram refers to the historical areas of plains south of Mount Merapi around present-day Muntilan , Sleman , Yogyakarta , to Prambanan . More precisely, it refer to Kota Gede area, the capital of the Sultanate in the outskirt of southern Yogyakarta.
A common practise in Java is to refer to their kingdom by metonymy , specifically by the location of its capital. Historically, there were two kingdoms that have existed in this region and both are called Mataram . The later kingdom however, is often called as Mataram Islam or "Mataram Sultanate" to distinguish it from the Hindu-Buddhist 9th-century Kingdom of Mataram .

Historiography
The key sources to uncover the history of Mataram Sultanate are local Javanese historical accounts called Babad , and Dutch accounts of Dutch East India Company (VOC). The problem with traditional Javanese Babad , are often undated, obscure and incorporates non-historic, mythological and fantastic elements. Most of this Javanese historical account are used as the tool to legitimise the authority of the ruler. The example of a mythical element is the sacred bonds between Panembahan Senapati with mythical Ratu Kidul , the ruler of Java's Southern Seas as his spiritual consort, as claimed in the Babad Tanah Jawi . [2]
The dates for events before the Siege of Batavia in the reign of Sultan Agung , third king of Mataram, are difficult to determine. There are several annals used by H.J. de Graaf in his histories such as Babad Sangkala and Babad Momana which contain list of events and dates in Javanese calendar (A.J., Anno Javanicus), but besides de Graaf’s questionable practice of simply adding 78 to Javanese years to obtain corresponding Christian years, the agreement between Javanese sources themselves is less than perfect.
The Javanese sources are very selective in putting dates to events. Events such as the rise and fall of kratons, the death of important princes, great wars, etc. are the only kind of events deemed important enough to be dated, by using a poetic formula chronogram called candrasengkala , which can be expressed verbally and pictorially, the rest being simply described in narrative succession without dates. Again these candrasengkalas do not always match the annals.
Therefore, it is suggested to follow the following rule of thumb: the dates from de Graaf and Ricklefs for the period before the Siege of Batavia can be accepted as best guess. For the period after the Siege of Batavia (1628–29) until the first War of Succession (1704), the years of events in which foreigners participated can be accepted as certain, but –again- are not always consistent with Javanese version of the story. The events in the period 1704–1755 can be dated with greater certainty since in this period the Dutch interfered deeply in Mataram affairs but events behind kraton walls are in general difficult to be dated precisely.

Formation and growth

Establishment of the kingdom
Details in Javanese sources about the early years of the kingdom are limited, and the line is unclear between the historical record and myths since there are indications of the efforts of later rulers, especially Agung, to establish a long line of legitimate descent by inventing predecessors. However, by the time more reliable records begin in the mid-17th century the kingdom was so large and powerful that most historians concur it had already been established for several generations.
According to Javanese records, the kings of Mataram were descended from one Ki Ageng Sela (Sela is a village near the present-day Demak ). In the 1570s, one of Ki Ageng Sela's descendants, Kyai Gedhe Pamanahan was awarded to rule the land of Mataram by King of Pajang , Sultan Hadiwijaya , as the reward for his service on defeating Arya Panangsang, Hadiwijaya's enemy. [3] Pajang was located near the current site of Surakarta , and Mataram was originally a vassal of Pajang. [1] Pamanahan was often referred to as Kyai Gedhe Mataram.
Meanwhile, in Pajang, there were major power struggles took place after the death of Sultan Hadiwijaya in 1582; Hadiwijaya's heir, Prince Benowo, was ousted by Arya Pangiri of Demak, and being removed to Jipang. Pamanahan's son, Sutawijaya or Panembahan Senapati Ingalaga, replaced his father around 1584, and he began to released Mataram from Pajang's control. Under Sutawijaya, Mataram grew substantially through military campaigns against Mataram's overlord of Pajang and Pajang's former overlord, Demak. The new Pajang Sultan, Arya Pangiri, was an unpopular ruler, and Benowo quickly rallied support to regain his throne and recruited Sutawijaya's support against Pajang. Subsequently Pajang was attacked from two directions, by Prince Benowo from Jipang and by Sutawijaya from Mataram, and finally was defeated. [3] After the defeat of Pajang, Prince Benowo did not dare to stand against Senapati and agreed to bowed down to him and submitted Pajang under Mataram's rule. This event in 1586, marked the end of Pajang kingdom and the rise of its former vassal, the Mataram Sultanate.

The rise of Mataram
Senapati assumed royal status by wearing the title "Panembahan" (literally "one who is worshipped/ sembah "). He revealed the expansive nature of his reign and began the fateful campaign to the East along the course of Solo River that would bring endless conflicts. In 1586, the wealthy port city of Surabaya rose against Panembahan Senapati. [3] Senapati however was unable to penetrate Surabayan defence. He then conquered Madiun in 1590-1 instead, and turned east from Madiun to conquer Kediri in 1591 and Ponorogo . [4] Perhaps during the same time he also conquered Jipang (present day Bojonegoro ) and Jagaraga (north of present-day Magetan). He reached east as far as Pasuruan , who may have used his threat to reduce pressure from the then powerful Surabaya. After his campaign in Central and East Java, Panembahan Senapati turned his attention to the West, as he forced Cirebon and Galuh in West Java to acknowledge Mataram's overlordship in 1595. [4] His effort to conquer Banten in West Java in 1597  — witnessed by Dutch sailors  — failed, perhaps due to lack of water transport. Later, Demak and Pati revolted and their forces almost reach the Mataram capital, before Senapati's cavalry manage to destroy them. [4] Panembahan Senapati died in 1601 and entombed in Kota Gede, he succeed on establishing a firm foundation of a new state. His successor, Mas Jolang or later known as Panembahan Seda ing Krapyak (Hanyakrawati), would face further rebellion. [4]
The reign of Panembahan Hanyakrawati ( circa 1601–1613), the son of Senapati, was dominated by further warfare, especially against powerful Surabaya, already a major centre of power in East Java. He faced rebellion from his relatives who were installed in the newly conquered Demak (1601–4), Ponorogo (1607–8) and Kediri (1608). In 1612 Surabaya, again, rose against Mataram, as the response Hanyakrawati conquered Mojokerto, destroyed Gresik and burned villages around Surabaya. Surabaya however, was still indomitable. [4]
The first contact between Mataram and the Dutch East India Company (VOC) occurred under Panembahan Hanyakrawati. Dutch activities at the time were limited to trading from limited coastal settlements, so their interactions with the inland Mataram kingdom were limited, although they did form an alliance against Surabaya in 1613. Panembahan Hanyakrawati died accidentally that year when he was in Krapyak forest, hunting for deer. He was given posthumous title Panembahan Seda ing Krapyak (His Majesty who Died in Krapyak)

Golden age
Panembahan Hanyakrawati was succeeded by his son, Adipati Martapura. Adipati Martapura however, was of poor health and quickly replaced by his brother, Raden Mas Rangsang in 1613, who assumed the title Panembahan ing Alaga, and later in 1641 took the title of Sultan Agung Hanyokrokusumo ("Great Sultan "). [4] Mataram Sultanate under the reign of Sultan Agung is popularly remembered as the apogee of Mataram's rule on Java, and the golden age of native Javanese power prior to European colonisation in following century.

Surabaya campaign and eastern conquests
Panembahan ing Alaga was an able military general and also a warlike ambitious leader, and he aspired to unite Java under Mataram's banner. [5] He responsible for the great expansion and lasting historical legacy of Mataram due to the extensive military conquests of his long reign from 1613 to 1646. [6] Under Sultan Agung, Mataram was able to expand its territory to include most of Java after capturing several port cities of northern Java. [1] Surabaya with its strong fortification and surrounded by swamps, was still the most formidable enemy of Mataram. In 1614, Surabaya forged an alliance with Kediri, Tuban and Pasuruan, and launched invasion against Mataram. In the following year, Sultan Agung managed to repel allied Surabaya forces in Wirasaba (present day Mojoagung, near Mojokerto). [6] He also conquered Malang , south of Surabaya. In 1616, Surabaya tried to attack Mataram but this army was crushed by Sultan Agung's forces in Siwalan, Pajang (near Solo). The coastal city of Lasem , near Rembang , was conquered in 1616 and Pasuruan, southeast of Surabaya, was taken in 1617. Tuban , one of the oldest and largest port cities on the coast of Java, was taken in 1619.
Surabaya was Mataram's most difficult enemy. Senapati was not strong enough to attack this powerful city and Hanyakrawati attacked it to no avail. Sultan Agung tried to weakened Surabaya by launching a naval campaign across Java Sea and capturing Sukadana , Surabaya's ally in southwest Kalimantan in 1622, and the island of Madura , another ally of Surabaya, was taken in 1624 after a fierce battle. [6] Soon Madura's fortifications in Sumenep and Pamekasan fell, Agung installed Adipati of Sampang as the Adipati of Madura, stylised as Prince Cakraningrat I. [6]
After five years of war, Agung finally conquered Surabaya in 1625. The city was taken not through outright military invasion, but instead through a siege; Agung installed a tight blockade from the land and sea, starving Surabaya into submission. [6] With Surabaya brought into the empire, the Mataram kingdom encompassed all of central and eastern Java, also Madura and Sukadana on southwest Borneo, [5] except for the west and east end of the island and its mountainous south (except for Mataram — of course). Sultan Agung consolidated his political unity by forging marriage alliance of his Adipati to the Princesses of Mataram. Agung himself took the hand of Cirebon Princess as his consort, in an effort to sealed Cirebon as Mataram's loyal ally. [5] By 1625, Mataram was undisputed ruler of Java. Such a mighty feat of arms, however, did not deter Mataram's former overlords from rebellion. Pajang rebelled in 1617, and Pati rebelled in 1627. After the capture of Surabaya in 1625, expansion stopped while the empire was busied by rebellions.

Batavia campaign and western conquests
Along western Java, Banten and the Dutch settlement in Batavia remained outside of Agung's control. In his effort to unite Java, Agung claimed Mataram as the successor state of Demak, which historically held Banten as a vassal state. However, the Banten Sultanate opposed Agung's claim, preferring to remain as a sovereign state. Agung therefore considered military conquest as a means to coerce Banten into Mataram's hegemony. However if Agung were march his armies to Banten, the port city of Batavia would stand as a potential opponent too near to the proximity of the Banten region. This did not deter Agung from pursuing his claim as he already perceived Dutch rule of Batavia as a threat to the Mataram hegemony, thereby inciting further reason to march upon Batavia whilst en-route to Banten. [5]
In 1628, Agung and his armies began the siege of Batavia . [1] The initial stages of the campaign against Batavia proved difficult due to a lack of logistical support for Agung's troops. To avoid a repeat of such inadequacy, Agung established farming settlements along the northern coast of West Java. This saw support from constructed rice barns and Javanese ships filled with rice rations to support Mataram troops. Upon discovery from Dutch ships and spies however, operations of these Javanese ships and rice barns were eventually put to a stop or burned down. [5] As a result, large numbers of Mataram troops again suffered from ill-adequate logistical support and eventually, starvation. Agung's attempt to invade Batavia ultimately ended in failure.

Cracking down rebellions and eastern campaign
In 1630, Mataram crushed a rebellion in Tembayat (southeast of Klaten ) and in 1631–36, Mataram had to suppress rebellion of Sumedang and Ukur in West Java. Ricklefs and de Graaf argued that these rebellions in the later part of Sultan Agung’s reign was mainly due to his inability to capture Batavia in 1628–29, which shattered his reputation of invincibility and inspired Mataram’s vassal to rebel. This argument seems untenable due to two reason: first, rebellions against Sultan Agung already began as far back as 1617 and occurred in Pati even during his peak of invincibility after taking Surabaya in 1625. The second, and more importantly, the military failure to capture Batavia was not seen as political failure by Javanese point of view. After the failed Batavia campaign, Gresik tried to regain power in East Java and led a revolt that quickly cracked down completely in 1635. [7]
The sultan also launched a " holy war " against the still-Hindu Blambangan in the extreme eastern Java. [1] At that time Blambangan kingdom was supported by Kingdom of Gelgel in Bali that treated it as a buffer against the Islamic expansion of Muslim Mataram. Blambangan surrendered in 1639, but quickly regained their independence and rejoined Bali soon after the Mataram troops withdrew. [7]
In 1641, Javanese envoys sent by Agung to Arabia have arrived home after obtaining permission to wear the title "Sultan" from Mecca . Mecca also sent numbers of ulama to Agung's court. His Islamic name and title gained from Mecca is "Sultan Abdul Muhammad Maulana Matarami". [8]
In 1645 Sultan Agung began building Imogiri , his burial place, about fifteen kilometres south of Yogyakarta. Imogiri remains the resting place of most of the royalty of Yogyakarta and Surakarta to this day. Agung died in the spring of 1646, leaving behind an empire that covered most of Java and stretched to its neighbouring islands.

Decline

Struggles for power
Upon taking the throne, Agung's son Susuhunan Amangkurat I tried to bring long-term stability to Mataram's realm, by murdering local leaders that were insufficiently deferential to him, including the still-powerful noble from Surabaya, Pangeran Pekik, his father-in-law, and executed Panembahan Adiningkusuma (posthumous: Panembahan Girilaya), king of Cirebon, his son in-law. He also had closing ports and destroying ships in Javanese coastal cities to prevent them from getting too powerful from their wealth. This action devastated Javanese coastal economy and has crippled Javanese maritime prowess that has been nurtured since Singhasari and Majapahit era, thus making Mataram mainly as an agricultural inland kingdom for centuries to come. Because of this deeds, Amangkurat I was notorious as a ruthless king. [9] Despite his political ruthlessness, unlike his father, Amangkurat I was not an accomplished military leader and dare not to pursue confrontation against the Dutch, as in 1646 he signed peace agreement with them. [9] To further his glory, the new king abandoned Karta, Sultan Agung’s capital, and moved to a grander red-brick palace in Plered (formerly the palace was built of wood).
By the mid-1670s dissatisfaction with the king was turning into open revolt, beginning from the recalcitrant Eastern Java and creeping inward. The Crown Prince (future Amangkurat II) felt that his life was not safe in the court after he took his father’s concubine with the help of his maternal grandfather, Pangeran Pekik of Surabaya, making Amangkurat I suspicious of a conspiracy among Surabayan factions to grab power in the capital by using Pekiks’ grandson’s powerful position as the Crown Prince. He conspired with Panembahan Rama from Kajoran, west of Magelang, who proposed a stratagem in which the Crown Prince financed Rama’s son-in-law, Trunajaya, to begin a rebellion in the East Java. Raden Trunajaya , a prince from Arosbaya, Madura, led a revolt supported by itinerant fighters from faraway Makassar led by Kraeng Galesong. [9] The Trunajaya rebellion moved swiftly and strong, and captured the king's court at Plered in Mataram in mid-1677. The king escaped to the north coast with his eldest son, the future king Amangkurat II , leaving his younger son Pangeran Puger in Mataram. Apparently more interested in profit and revenge than in running a struggling empire, the rebel Trunajaya looted the court and withdrew to his stronghold in Kediri, East Java, leaving Prince Puger in control of a weak court. Seizing this opportunity, Puger assumed the throne in the ruins of Plered with the title Susuhanan ing Alaga.

Amangkurat II and the beginning of foreign involvement
On his way to Batavia to ask for Dutch's help, Amangkurat I died in the village of Tegalarum near Tegal just after his expulsion, making Amangkurat II king in 1677. [9] He too was nearly helpless, having fled without an army nor treasury to build one. In an attempt to regain his kingdom, he made substantial concessions to the Dutch East India Company (VOC), who then went to war to reinstate him. He promised to give VOC the port town of Semarang if they lend him some troops. [9] For the Dutch, a stable Mataram empire that was deeply indebted to them would help ensure continued trade on favourable terms. They were willing to lend their military might to keep the kingdom together.
The multinational Dutch forces, consisting of light-armed troops from Makasar and Ambon, in addition to heavily equipped European soldiers, first defeated Trunajaya in Kediri in November 1678 and Trunajaya himself was captured in 1679 near Ngantang west of Malang, then in 1681, the alliance of VOC and Amangkurat II forced Susuhunan ing Alaga (Puger) to relinquish the throne in favour of his elder brother Amangkurat II. In 1680, Amangkurat II ascends as the king of Mataram by receiving his crown from the Dutch. As the compensation for Dutch supports, other than Semarang, Mataram has to hand over Bogor , Karawang and Priangan to VOC. [9] Cirebon too was forced to shift allegiance from Mataram to the Dutch, and becomes Dutch's protectorate state. Since the fallen Plered was considered inauspicious, Amangkurat II move the capital to Kartasura in the land of Pajang (northern part of the stretch of land between Mount Merapi and Mount Lawu, the southern part being Mataram). The Dutch also erected a fort in Kartasura in an effort to control as well as protect the new capital. [9]
By providing help in regaining his throne, the Dutch brought Amangkurat II under their tight control. Amangkurat II was apparently unhappy with the situation, especially the increasing Dutch control of the coast, but he was helpless in the face of a crippling financial debt and the threat of Dutch military power. The king engaged in a series of intrigues to try to weaken the Dutch position without confronting them head on; for example, by trying to co-operate with other kingdoms such as Cirebon and Johor and the court sheltered people wanted by the Dutch for attacking colonial offices or disrupting shipping such as Untung Surapati. In 1685, Batavia sent Captain Tack, the officer who captured Trunojoyo, to capture Surapati and negotiate further details into the agreement between VOC and Amangkurat II but the king arranged a ruse in which he pretended to help Tack. Tack was killed when pursuing Surapati in Kartasura, then capital of Mataram (present day Kartasura near Solo), but Batavia decided to do nothing since the situation in Batavia itself was far from stable, such as the insurrection of Captain Jonker, native commander of Ambonese settlement in Batavia, in 1689. Mainly due to this incident, by the end of his reign, Amangkurat II was deeply distrusted by the Dutch, but Batavia were similarly uninterested in provoking another costly war on Java.

Wars of succession
Amangkurat II died in 1703 and was briefly succeeded by his son, Amangkurat III . [9] However, this time the Dutch believed they had found a more reliable client, and hence supported his uncle Pangeran Puger, formerly Susuhunan ing Alaga, who had previously been defeated by VOC and Amangkurat II. Before the Dutch, he accused Amangkurat III of planning an uprising in East Java. Unlike Pangeran Puger, Amangkurat III inherited a blood connection with Surabayan ruler, Jangrana II, from Amangkurat II and this lent credibility to the allegation that he cooperated with the now powerful Untung Surapati in Pasuruan. Panembahan Cakraningrat II of Madura, VOC’s most trusted ally, persuaded the Dutch to support Pangeran Puger. Though Cakraningrat II harboured personal hatred towards Puger, this move is understandable since alliance between Amangkurat III and his Surabaya relatives and Surapati in Bangil would be a great threat to Madura’s position, even though Jangrana II’s father was Cakraningrat II’s son-in-law.
Pangeran Puger took the title of Pakubuwana I upon his accession in June 1704. The conflict between Amangkurat III and Pakubuwana I, the latter allied with the Dutch, usually termed First Javanese War of Succession , dragged on for five years before the Dutch managed to install Pakubuwana. In August 1705, Pakubuwono I’s retainers and VOC forces captured Kartasura without resistance from Amangkurat III, whose forces cowardly turned back when the enemy reached Ungaran. Surapati’s forces in Bangil, near Pasuruan, was crushed by the alliance of VOC, Kartasura and Madura in 1706. Jangrana II, who tended to side with Amangkurat III and did not venture any assistance to the capture of Bangil, was called to present himself before Pakubuwana I and murdered there by VOC’s request in the same year. Amangkurat III ran away to Malang with Surapati’s descendants and his remnant forces but Malang was then a no-man’s-land who offered no glory fit for a king. Therefore, though allied operations to the eastern interior of Java in 1706–08 did not gain much success in military terms, the fallen king surrendered in 1708 after being lured with the promises of household (lungguh) and land, but he was banished to Ceylon along with his wives and children. This is the end of Surabayan faction in Mataram, and – as we shall see later – this situation would ignite the political time bomb planted by Sultan Agung with his capture of Surabaya in 1625.
With the installation of Pakubuwana, the Dutch substantially increased their control over the interior of Central Java. Pakubuwana I was more than willing to agree to anything the VOC asked of him. In 1705 he agreed to cede the regions of Cirebon and eastern part of Madura (under Cakraningrat II), in which Mataram had no real control anyway, to the VOC. The VOC was given Semarang as new headquarters, the right to build fortresses anywhere in Java, a garrison in the kraton in Kartasura, monopoly over opium and textiles, and the right to buy as much rice as they wanted. Mataram would pay an annual tribute of 1300 metric tons of rice. Any debt made before 1705 was cancelled. In 1709, Pakubuwana I made another agreement with the VOC in which Mataram would pay annual tribute of wood, indigo and coffee (planted since 1696 by VOC’s request) in addition to rice. These tributes, more than anything else, made Pakubuwana I the first genuine puppet of the Dutch. On paper, these terms seemed very advantageous to the Dutch, since the VOC itself was in financial difficulties during the period of 1683–1710. But the ability of the king to fulfil the terms of agreement depended largely on the stability of Java, for which VOC has made a guarantee. It turned out later that the VOC’s military might was incapable of such a huge task.
The last years of Pakubuwana's reign, from 1717 to 1719, were dominated by rebellion in East Java against the kingdom and its foreign patrons. The murder of Jangrana II in 1706 incited his three brothers, regents of Surabaya, Jangrana III, Jayapuspita and Surengrana, to raise a rebellion with the help of Balinese mercenaries in 1717. Pakubuwana I’s tributes to the VOC secured him a power which was feared by his subjects in Central Java, but this is for the first time since 1646 that Mataram was ruled by a king without any eastern connection. Surabaya had no reason to submit any more and thirst for vengeance made the brother regents openly contest Mataram’s power in Eastern Java. Cakraningkrat III who ruled Madura after ousting the VOC’s loyal ally Cakraningrat II, had every reason to side with his cousins this time. The VOC managed to capture Surabaya after a bloody war in 1718 and Madura was pacified when Cakraningrat III was killed in a fight on board of the VOC’s ship in Surabaya in the same year though the Balinese mercenaries plundered eastern Madura and was repulsed by VOC in the same year. However, similar to the situation after Trunajaya’s uprising in 1675, the interior regencies in East Java (Ponorogo, Madiun, Magetan, Jogorogo) joined the rebellion en masse. Pakubuwana I sent his son, Pangeran Dipanagara (not to be confused with another prince with the same title who fought the Dutch in 1825–1830) to suppress the rebellion in the eastern interior but instead Dipanagara joined the rebel and assumed the messianic title of Panembahan Herucakra.
In 1719 Pakubuwana I died and his son Amangkurat IV took the throne in 1719, but his brothers, Pangeran Blitar and Purbaya, contested the succession. They attacked the kraton in June 1719. When they were repulsed by the cannons in VOC’s fort, they retreated south to the land of Mataram. Another royal brother, Pangeran Arya Mataram, ran to Japara and proclaimed himself king, thus began the Second War of Succession. Before the year ended, Arya Mataram surrendered and was strangled in Japara by king’s order, and Blitar and Purbaya was dislodged from their stronghold in Mataram in November. In 1720, these two princes ran away to the still rebellious interior of East Java. Luckily for VOC and the young king, the rebellious regents of Surabaya, Jangrana III and Jayapuspita died in 1718–20 and Pangeran Blitar died in 1721. In May and June 1723, the remnants of the rebels and their leaders surrendered, including Surengrana of Surabaya, Pangeran Purbaya and Dipanagara, all of whom were banished to Ceylon, except Purbaya, who was taken to Batavia to serve as “backup” to replace Amangkurat IV in case of any disruption in the relationship between the king and VOC since Purbaya was seen to have equal "legitimacy" by VOC. It is obvious from these two Wars of Succession that even though the VOC was virtually invincible in the field, mere military prowess was not sufficient to pacify Java.

Court intrigues in 1723–1741
After 1723, the situation seemed to stabilise, much to the delight of the Dutch. Javanese nobility had learned that the alliance of VOC’s military with any Javanese faction made them nearly invincible. It seemed that VOC’s plan to reap the profit from a stable Java under a kingdom which was deeply indebted to VOC would soon be realised. In 1726, Amangkurat IV fell to an illness that resembled poisoning. His son assumed the throne as Pakubuwana II , this time without any serious resistance from anybody. The history for the period of 1723 until 1741 was dominated by a series of intrigues which further showed the fragile nature of Javanese politics, held together by Dutch’s effort. In this relatively peaceful situation, the king could not gather the support of his "subjects" and instead was swayed by short-term ends siding with this faction for a moment and then to another. The king never seemed to lack challenges to his "legitimacy".
The descendants of Amangkurat III, who were allowed to return from Ceylon, and the royal brothers, especially Pangeran Ngabehi Loring Pasar and the banished Pangeran Arya Mangkunegara, tried to gain the support of the Dutch by spreading gossips of rebellion against the king and the patih (vizier), Danureja. At the same time, the patih tried to strengthen his position by installing his relatives and clients in the regencies, sometimes without king’s consent, at the expense of other nobles’ interests, including the powerful queens dowager, Ratu Amangkurat (Amangkurat IV’s wife) and Ratu Pakubuwana (Pakubuwana I’s wife), much to the confusion of the Dutch.
The king tried to break the dominance of this Danureja by asking the help of the Dutch to banish him, but Danureja’s successor, Natakusuma, was influenced heavily by the Queen’s brother, Arya Purbaya, son of the rebel Pangeran Purbaya, who was also Natakusuma’s brother-in-law. Arya Purbaya’s erratic behaviour in court, his alleged homosexuality which was abhorred by the pious king and rumours of his planning a rebellion against the “heathen” (the Dutch) caused unrest in Kartasura and hatred from the nobles. After his sister, the Queen, died of miscarriage in 1738, the king asked the Dutch to banish him, to which the Dutch complied gladly. Despite these faction strruggles, the situation in general did not show any signs of developing into full-scale war. Eastern Java was quiet: though Cakraningrat IV refused to pay homage to the court with various excuses, Madura was held under firm control by VOC and Surabaya did not stir. But dark clouds were forming. This time, the explosion came from the west: Batavia itself.

Chinese War 1741–1743
In the meantime, the Dutch were contending with other problems. The excessive use of land for sugar cane plantation in the interior of West Java reduced the flow of water in Ciliwung River (which flows through the city of Batavia) and made the city canals an ideal breeding ground for mosquitoes, resulting in a series of malaria outbreaks in 1733–1795. This was aggravated by the fall of sugar price in European market, bringing bankruptcy to sugar factories in the areas around Batavia (the Ommelanden), which were mostly operated by Chinese labour. The unrest prompted VOC authorities to reduce the number of unlicensed Chinese settlers, who had been smuggled into Batavia by Chinese sugar factory owners. These labourers were loaded onto ships out of Batavia but the rumour that these people were thrown into the sea as soon as the ship was beyond the horizon caused panic among the remaining Chinese. On 7 October 1740, several Chinese mobs attacked Europeans outside the city and incited the Dutch to order a massacre two days later. The Chinese settlement in Batavia was looted for several days, in which 10,000 Chinese were killed . The Chinese ran away and captured Bekasi, which was dislodged by VOC in June 1741.
In 1741, Chinese rebels were present in Central Java, particularly around Tanjung (Welahan), Pati , Grobogan , and Kaliwungu . In May 1741 Juwana was captured by the Chinese. The Javanese at first sided with the Dutch and reinforced Demak on 10 June 1741. Two days later, a detachment of Javanese forces together with VOC forces of European, Balinese and Buginese in Semarang to defend Tugu, west of Semarang. The Chinese rebel lured them into their main forces’s position in Mount Bergota through narrow road and ambushed them. The allied forces were dispersed and ran as fast as they could back to Semarang. The Chinese pursued them but were repulsed by Dutch cannons in the fortress. Semarang was seized by panic. By July 1741, the Chinese occupied Kaligawe, south of Semarang, Rembang, and besieged Jepara. This is the most dangerous time for VOC. Military superiority would enable VOC to hold Semarang without any support from Mataram forces, but it would mean nothing since a turbulent interior would disrupt trade and therefore profit, VOC’s main objective. One VOC high official, Abraham Roos, suggested that VOC assumed royal function in Java by denying Pakubuwana II’s “legitimacy” and asking the regents to take an oath of loyalty to VOC’s sovereignty. This was turned down by the Council of Indies (Raad van Indie) in Batavia, since even if VOC managed to conquer the coast, it would not be strong enough to conquer the mountainous interior of Java, which do not provide much level plain required by Western method of warfare. Therefore, the Dutch East India Company must support its superior but inadequate military by picking the right allies. One such ally had presented itself, that is Cakraningkrat IV of Madura who could be relied on to gold the eastern coast against the Chinese, but the interior of Eastern and Central Java was beyond the reach of this quarrelsome prince. Therefore, VOC had no choice but to side with Pakubuwana II.
VOC’s dire situation after the Battle of Tugu in July 1741 did not escape the king’s attention, but – like Amangkurat II – he avoided any open breach with VOC since his own kraton was not lacking of factions against him. He ordered Patih Natakusuma to do all the dirty work, such as ordering the Arch-Regent (Adipati) of Jipang (Bojonegoro), one Tumenggung Mataun, to join the Chinese. In September 1741, the king ordered Patih Natakusuma and several regents to help the Chinese besiege Semarang and let Natakusuma attack VOC garrison in Kartasura, who were starved into submission in August. However, reinforcement from VOC’s posts in Outer Islands were arriving since August and they were all wisely concentrated to repel the Chinese around Semarang. In the beginning of November, the Dutch attacked Kaligawe, Torbaya around Semarang, and repulsed the alliance of Javanese and Chinese forces who were stationed in four separate fortress and did not co-ordinate with each other. At the end of November, Cakraningrat IV had controlled the stretch of east coast from Tuban to Sedayu and the Dutch relieved Tegal of Chinese rebels. This caused Pakubuwana II to change sides and open negotiations with the Dutch.
In the next year 1742, the alliance of Javanese and Chinese let Semarang alone and captured Kudus and Pati in February. In March, Pakubuwana II sent a messenger to negotiate with the Dutch in Semarang and offered them absolute control over all northern coasts of Java and the privilege to appoint patih. VOC promptly sent van Hohendorff with a small force to observe the situation in Kartasura. Things began to get worse for Pakubuwana II. In April, the rebels set up Raden Mas Garendi, a descendant of Amangkurat III, as king with the title of Sunan Kuning.
In May, the Dutch agreed to support Pakubuwana II after considering that after all, the regencies in eastern interior were still loyal to this weak king but the Javano-Chinese rebel alliance had occupied the only road from Semarang to Kartasura and captured Salatiga. The princes in Mataram tried to attack the Javano-Chinese alliance but they were repulsed. On 30 June 1742, the rebels captured Kartasura and van Hohendorff had to run away from a hole in kraton wall with the helpless Pakubuwana II on his back. The Dutch, however, ignored Kartasura’s fate in rebel hands and concentrated its forces under Captain Gerrit mother and Nathaniel Steinmets to repulse the rebels around Demak, Welahan, Jepara, Kudus and Rembang. By October 1742, the northern coast of Central Java was cleaned of the rebels, who seemed to disperse into the traditional rebel hideout in Malang to the east and the Dutch forces returned to Semarang in November. Cakraningrat IV, who wished to free the eastern coast of Java from Mataram influence, could not deter the Dutch from supporting Pakubuwana II but he managed to capture and plunder Kartasura in November 1742. In December 1742, VOC negotiated with Cakraningrat and managed to persuade him to relieve Kartasura of Madurese and Balinese troops under his pay. The treasures, however, remained in Cakraningrat’s hand.
The reinstatement of Pakubuwana II in Kartasura on 14 December 1742 marked the end of the Chinese war. It showed who was in control of the situation. Accordingly, Sunan Kuning surrendered in October 1743, followed by other rebel leaders. In the mid-18th century, Mataram lost much of their lands, by 1743 Mataram only consists of areas around Surakarta, Yogyakarta, Kedu and Bagelen. [10] Cakraningrat IV was definitely not pleased with this situation and he began to make alliance with Surabaya, the descendants of Untung Surapati, and hired more Balinese mercenaries. He stopped paying tribute to VOC in 1744, and after a failed attempt to negotiate, the Dutch attacked Madura in 1745 and ousted Cakraningrat, who was banished to the Cape in 1746.

Division of Mataram
The fall of Kartasura made the palace inauspicious for the king and Pakubuwana II built a new kraton in Surakarta or Solo and moved there in 1746. However, Pakubuwana II was far from secure in this throne. Raden Mas Said , or Pangeran Sambernyawa (meaning "Soul Reaper"), son of banished Arya Mangkunegara, who later would establish the princely house of Mangkunagara in Solo, and several other princes of the royal blood still maintained rebellion. Pakubuwana II declared that anyone who can suppress the rebellion in Sukawati, areas around present day Sragen, would be rewarded with 3000 households. Pangeran Mangkubumi , Pakuwana II’s brother, who would later establish the royal house of Yogyakarta took the challenge and defeated Mas Said in 1746. But when he claimed his prize, his old enemy, patih Pringgalaya, advised the king against it. In the middle of this problem, VOC’s Governor General, van Imhoff, paid a visit to the kraton, the first one to do so during the whole history of the relation between Mataram and VOC, to confirm the de facto Dutch possession of coastal and several interior regions. Pakubuwana II hesitantly accepted the cession in lieu of 20,000 real per year. Mangkubumi was dissatisfied with his brother’s decision to yield to van Imhoff’s insistence, which was made without consulting the other members of royal family and great nobles. van Imhoff had neither experience nor tactfulness to understand the delicate situation in Mataram and he rebuked Mangkubumi as “too ambitious” before the whole court when Mangkubumi claimed the 3000 households. This shameful treatment from a foreigner who had wrested the most prosperous lands of Mataram from his weak brother led him to raise his followers into rebellion in May 1746, this time with the help of Mas Said.
In the midst of Mangkubumi rebellion in 1749, Pakubuwana II fell ill and called van Hohendorff, his trusted friend who saved his life during the fall of Kartasura in 1742. He asked Hohendorff to assume control over the kingdom. Hohendorff was naturally surprised and refused, thinking that he would be made king of Mataram, but when the king insisted on it, he asked his sick friend to confirm it in writing. On 11 December 1749, Pakubuwana II signed an agreement in which the "sovereignty" of Mataram was given to VOC.
On 15 December 1749, Hohendorff announced the accession of Pakubuwana II’s son as the new king of Mataram with the title Pakubuwana III. However, three days earlier, Mangkubumi in his stronghold in Yogyakarta also announced his accession with the title Mangkubumi, with Mas Said as his patih. This rebellion got stronger day by day and even in 1753 the Crown Prince of Surakarta joined the rebels. VOC decided that it did have not the military capability to suppress this rebellion, though in 1752, Mas Said broke away from Hamengkubuwana. By 1754, all parties were tired of war and ready to negotiate.
The kingdom of Mataram was divided in 1755 under an agreement signed in Giyanti between the Dutch under the Governor General Nicolaas Hartingh and rebellious prince Mangkubumi. The treaty divided nominal control over central Java between Yogyakarta Sultanate , under Mangkubumi, and Surakarta , under Pakubuwana. [10] Mas Said, however, proved to be stronger than the combined forces of Solo, Yogya and VOC. In 1756, he even almost captured Yogyakarta, but he realised that he could not defeat the three powers all by himself. In February 1757 he surrendered to Pakubuwana III and was given 4000 households, all taken from Pakubuwana III’s own lungguh, and a parcel of land near Solo, the present day Mangkunegaran Palace, and the title of " Pangeran Arya Adipati Mangkunegara ". This settlement proved successful in that political struggle was again confined to palace or inter-palace intrigues and peace was maintained until 1812.

Culture
Despite being an Islamic Sultanate, Mataram had never adopted Islamic culture, systems and institutions thoroughly. Its political system was more like a syncretism of earlier Javanese Hindu civilisation merged with Islamic elements. The major formation took place during Sultan Agung's reign as he adapted Islam to the Hindu-Javanese tradition and introduced a new calendar in 1633 based on Islamic and Javanese practice. The arts during Sultan Agung's reign were a mixture of Islamic and Hindu-Javanese elements. [1] The mainstream belief system was the Kejawen tradition, while the Islamic beliefs was held by a handful of kiyai or ulama religious elite clustering around Kauman area near court's mosque. The Javanese court ceremonies, culture and rituals of Mataram still bears Hindu-Buddhist elements. Javanese cultural elements , such as gamelan , batik , kris , wayang kulit and Javanese dance were formulated, codified and took its present form during this period, and inherited by its successors, the courts of Surakarta and Yogyakarta , and the princedom of Mangkunegaran and Pakualaman .

Javanese kingship
Javanese kingship varies from Western kingship, which is essentially based on the idea of legitimacy from the people ( Democracy ), or from God ( divine authority ), or both. The Javanese language does not include words with these meanings. The concept of the Javanese kingdom is a mandala , or a centre of the world, in the sense of both a central location and a central being, focused on the person of the king (variously called Sri Bupati, Sri Narendra, Sang Aji, Prabu ). The king is regarded as a semi-divine being, a union of divine and human aspects ( binathara , the passive form of “bathara”, god). Javanese kingship is a matter of royal-divine presence, not a specific territory or population. People may come and go without interrupting the identity of a kingdom which lies in the succession of semi-divine kings. Power, including royal power is not qualitatively different from the power of dukuns or shamans , but it is much stronger. Javanese kingship is not based on the legitimacy of a single individual, since anyone can contest power by tapa or asceticism, and many did contest the kings of Mataram.

List of Sultans of Mataram
Mataram was divided in 1755, and the succeeding rulers of the new sultanates are not generally considered as Sultans of Mataram .

Legacy
Mataram Sultanate was the last major native polity in Java prior the kingdom broke into of courts of Surakarta and Yogyakarta , and the princedom of Mangkunegaran and Pakualaman , and prior the island was completely ruled by the Dutch. For some Central Javanese, especially those hailed from Yogyakarta and Surakarta city, the Mataram Sultanate, especially Sultan Agung's era, was remembered with pride as a glorious past, as Mataram become the regional hegemon after Majapahit, almost completely unified Java island, and almost succeed to drive the Dutch out of Java. However, for those of former Mataram's rivals or vassals; East Javanese Surabayan, Madurese and Blambangan, also Priangan and Cirebon of West Java, Mataram era is remembered as the era of Central Javanese overlordship over them, marked with authoritarianism and arbitrariness of feudal Javanese regime. In the future this would lead to interregional Madura - Central Java animosity. [11] Also to some degree, Priangan –Mataraman rivalry. Within Mataraman realm, the disintegration of Mataram Sultanate into several competing keratons , also would lead to Surakarta–Yogyakarta rivalry.
In art and culture, the Mataram Sultanate has left an everlasting mark in Javanese culture , as many of Javanese cultural elements, such as gamelan , batik , kris , wayang kulit and Javanese dance were formulated, codified and took its present form during this period, inherited and preserved diligently by its successor keratons . During the height of Mataram Sultanate in the first half of the 17th century, Javanese culture expanded, much of Western and East Java region are being Javanized. Mataram's campaign on Eastern Javanese principalities such as Surabaya and Pasuruan expanded Mataraman influences on Java. Mataram expansion includes Sundanese principalities of Priangan highlands; from Galuh Ciamis, Sumedang, Bandung and Cianjur. It was during this period that Sundanese people were exposed and assimilated further into Javanese Kejawen culture. Wayang Golek are Sundanese taking on Javanese Wayang Kulit culture, similar shared culture such as gamelan and batik also flourished. It is probably during this times that Sundanese language began to adopt the stratified degree of term and vocabulary to denote politeness, as reflected in Javanese language . In addition, Javanese scripts also used to write Sundanese as cacarakan .
In political aspect, the incessant war of succession, treason, rebellion and court intrigue of Javanese Mataram keraton during the last period of its history, has made Mataram being remembered in quite unflattering way. Combined with Javanese behaviour, such as obsession with elegance and refinements (Javanese: alus ), subtleness, politeness, courtesy, indirectness, emotional restraint and consciousness to one's social stature, has made Mataram politics quite complicated, intricate and deceitful. As the result the negative aspects of Javanisation of contemporary Indonesian politics, such as dishonesty, deceptive, treacherousness, rigidity of social hierarchy, authoritarianism and arbitrariness, accompanied by fondness of status display and arrogance, is often attributed to and called as "Mataramization". [12] A typical negative description of priyayi behaving like the member of Javanese upper class.

Rodrigo Duterte
Rodrigo " Rody " Roa Duterte ( Tagalog: [roˈdɾigo dʊˈtɛrtɛ] ; born March 28, 1945), also known as Digong , [5] is a Filipino lawyer and politician who is the 16th and current President of the Philippines . [6] [7] [8] He is the first Mindanaoan to hold the office, and the fourth of Visayan descent . [9] At 71 years old, Duterte is the oldest person to assume the Philippine presidency ; the record was previously held by Sergio Osmeña 's at the age of 65. [10]
Duterte studied political science at the Lyceum of the Philippines University , graduating in 1968, before obtaining a law degree from San Beda College of Law in 1972. He then worked as a lawyer and was a prosecutor for Davao City , a highly urbanized city on Mindanao island , before becoming vice mayor and, subsequently, mayor of the city in the wake of the Philippine Revolution of 1986 . Duterte was among the longest-serving mayors in the Philippines , serving seven terms totaling more than 22 years in office.
Duterte's political success has been aided by his vocal support for the extrajudicial killing of drug users and other criminals. [11] According to Reuters , human rights groups have documented over 1,400 killings allegedly by vigilante groups occurring in Davao between 1998 and May 2016; the victims were mainly drug users, petty criminals and street children . [12] Duterte has alternately confirmed and denied his involvement in the killings. [13] A January 2016 decision by the Office of the Ombudsman on the alleged death squad in Davao between 2005 and 2009 found "no evidence to support 'the killings attributed or attributable to the Davao Death Squad much less the involvement of Mayor Rodrigo Duterte". [14] Duterte has repeatedly confirmed that he personally killed three kidnapping suspects while Mayor of Davao in 1988. [15] [16]
On May 9, 2016, Duterte won the Philippine presidential election with 39.01% of the votes, defeating his Liberal opponent, Mar Roxas [17] after a campaign in which he promised to crush criminality by killing tens of thousands of criminals. [18] His domestic policy has focused on combating the illegal drug trade by initiating the Philippine Drug War . Following criticism from United Nations human rights experts that extrajudicial killings had increased since the election, he threatened to withdraw the Philippines from the UN and form a new organization with China and African nations. [19] He has declared to pursue an " independent foreign policy ", [20] though he has sought to distance the Philippines from the United States and Europe and pursue closer ties with China and Russia.

Early life
Duterte was born on March 28, 1945, in Maasin (now the capital of Southern Leyte but was then part of the insular province of Leyte in the Philippine Commonwealth ). [21] His maternal grandfather was a Chinese immigrant from Xiamen , Fujian . [22] His father was Vicente G. Duterte (1911–1968), a Cebuano lawyer; and his mother Soledad Duterte ( née Roa) (1916–2012), was a school teacher from Cabadbaran , Agusan and a civic leader of Maranao descent. Duterte's father was acting mayor of Danao , Cebu and subsequently the provincial governor of (the then-undivided) Davao province .
Rodrigo's cousin Ronald, on the other hand, served as Cebu City mayor from 1983 to 1986. Ronald's father, Ramon Duterte, also held the position from 1957 to 1959. The Dutertes consider the Cebu-based political families of the Durano and the Almendras clan as relatives. [23] Duterte also has relatives from the Roa clan in Leyte through his mother's side. [24] Before they resettled to Davao, Duterte's family briefly lived in his birthplace in Maasin, Leyte, and in his father's hometown in Danao, Cebu, until he was four years old. [25]
The Dutertes initially moved to Mindanao in 1948 but still went back and forth to the Visayas until 1949. [26] They finally settled in the Davao Region in 1950. Vicente as a lawyer engaged in private practice, while Soledad taught in public schools as a teacher. Mrs Duterte, however, retired as a supervisor in 1952 when her lawyer-husband entered politics there.

Education
Duterte went to Laboon Elementary School in Maasin, for a year. [24] He spent his remaining elementary days at the Santa Ana Elementary School in Davao City , where he graduated in 1956. He finished his secondary education in the High School Department of the then Holy Cross College of Digos (now Cor Jesu College ) in today's city of Digos in the now defunct Davao province , after being expelled twice from previous schools, including one in Ateneo de Davao University High School due to misconduct. [23] He graduated in 1968 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science at the Lyceum of the Philippines in Manila. He obtained a law degree from San Beda College of Law in 1972. In the same year, he passed the bar exam. Duterte eventually became Special Counsel at the City Prosecution Office in Davao City from 1977–79, Fourth Assistant City Prosecutor from 1979–81, Third Assistant City Prosecutor from 1981–83, and Second Assistant City Prosecutor from 1983–86.

Abuse
Duterte has said that he was sexually abused by a priest when he was a minor. [27] After he was challenged by the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) and AdDU officials to name the priest and file a case against him, Duterte then revealed the priest's name as Fr. Mark Falvey, SJ (d. 1975). [27] The Jesuits of the Society of Jesus in the Philippines confirmed that according to press reports in the United States, in May 2007, the Society of Jesus agreed to a tentative payout of USD16 million to settle claims that Falvey sexually abused at least nine children in Los Angeles from 1959 to 1975. Accusations against Falvey began in 2002 and he was never charged with a crime. Additionally in May 2008, the Diocese of Sacramento paid $100,000 settlement to a person allegedly raped and molested by Mark's brother, Fr. Arthur Falvey. However, it was not clearly indicated in the report if Mark Falvey was assigned at the Jesuit-run Ateneo de Davao. [28] When asked why he didn't complain when the abuse supposedly happened, Duterte claimed that he was too young to complain about the priest's abuse and was intimidated by authorities at that time. He also stated that he never disclosed that information after he was expelled and moved to a different high school and especially not to his family. [29]

Shooting of student at law school
Duterte stated at a rally in April 2016 that he shot a fellow student who had belittled him about his Visayan origin as well as other students of the same ethnicity, while at San Beda law college. He said "But the truth is, I'm used to shooting people. When we were about to graduate from San Beda, I shot a person." Duterte said that he shot the student in a corridor at the college. He later told a reporter that the student survived, but refused to answer any further questions about the incident. [30]

Mayor of Davao City
After the 1986 People Power Revolution , Duterte was appointed officer-in-charge vice mayor by president Corazon Aquino . [31] In 1988, he ran for mayor and won, serving until 1998. He set a precedent by designating deputy mayors that represented the Lumad and Moro peoples in the city government, which was later copied in other parts of the Philippines. In 1998, because he was term-limited to run again for mayor, he ran for the House of Representatives and won as Congressman of the 1st District of Davao City (under the Laban ng Makabayang Masang Pilipino coalition). In 2001, he ran again for mayor in Davao and was again elected for his fourth term. He was re-elected in 2004 and in 2007. [32]
In 2013, Davao City sent rescue and medical teams to Tacloban to give aid to the victims of Typhoon Haiyan , locally known in the country as Typhoon Yolanda. Financial assistance was also given to Bohol and Cebu for the earthquake victims. [33]
In 2010, he was elected vice mayor, succeeding his daughter, Sara Duterte-Carpio , who was elected as mayor. He has been offered the Interior Secretary post 4 times, by presidents Fidel V. Ramos , Joseph Ejercito Estrada , Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo , and Benigno S. Aquino III but rejected all of them. [23]
Duterte banned swimsuit competitions in beauty pageants in Davao City. [34] Duterte also gained prominence for supporting the first-ever Gawad Kalinga Village inside a jail facility which is only located in Davao City. It is a home-type jail with ten cottages built inside the compound, which now serve as home for women inmates. [35]

Law and order
Through the support of Duterte, the City Council amended ordinance No. 1627, Series of 1994, to impose a prohibition on selling, serving, drinking and consuming alcoholic beverages from 01:00 until 08:00 each morning. Executive Order No. 39 was signed by Duterte, reducing the speed limits for all kinds of motor vehicles within the territorial jurisdiction of Davao City in the interest of public safety and order. [36] Duterte also signed Executive Order No. 04, Series of 2013 to impose an order creating the implementing of rules and regulations for the new comprehensive anti-smoking ordinance no. 0367-12, Series of 2012. [37] Davao City's Firecracker Ban was also implemented with ordinance No. 060-02/1406-02, Series of 2002 by the City Council through the support of Duterte. [38]
Another known accomplishment was that the City Government of Davao was able to acquire 10 more ambulances for central 911 intended for medical emergencies and 42 new mobile patrol vehicles and motorcycles for the Davao City Police Office (the first and only 9-1-1 emergency telephone number in Asia which is also free of charge). [39] Duterte, through Executive Order No. 24, ordered all shopping malls and commercial centers to install, operate and maintain high end and high definition closed circuit television (CCTV) cameras at all entrance and exit points of their premises. [40]
Duterte also passed the city's Women Development Code, the first and only in the country, which aims "to uphold the rights of women and the belief in their worth and dignity as human beings" and pushed for the Magna Carta for Women in Davao. It is a comprehensive women's human rights law that seeks to eliminate discrimination against women. [41] [42]

Crime rate
Reuters reported in May 2016 that according to national police Davao City has the highest murder rate and the second highest rape rate among 15 Philippine cities, and that locals think that the city has become safer because of Duterte's campaigns against drugs and crime. [43] [44]
Crime figures reported by Duterte, stated that crime in the city was significantly reduced during the period 1985–2000. Duterte suggested that there had been a decrease in crime from a triple-digit crime rate per 1,000 people in 1985, to 0.8 cases per 10,000 inhabitants in the period 1999 to 2005. Furthermore, according to police statistics, the population in Davao City grew from 1.12 million to 1.44 million between 1999 and 2008 (29 per cent). In the corresponding period, the incidence of reported crime rose from 975 to 3,391 (248 per cent). [45]
The number of index crimes have significantly decreased since 2013 and 2015, with most killings occurring during police operations. [46]
Prostitution in the Philippines is illegal. In Davao, by city ordinance, police ensure that prostitutes have a valid health card, but do not arrest them. [47] In 2010, the Philippine Child Protection Unit stated that Davao was one of the top five areas for child prostitution and sex tourism in the Philippines. [48] Jeanette Ampog, the executive director of Talikala , a Davao-based NGO that helps prostitutes, said in October 2016 that child prostitution had sharply increased over the past two years. She said that children were cheaper and more marketable. [49]

Alleged extrajudicial killings
Duterte, who has been dubbed "The Punisher" by Time magazine, [50] has been linked by human rights groups such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch to extrajudicial killings of over 1,400 alleged criminals and street children by vigilante death squads . [11] [51] In the April 2009 UN General Assembly of the Human Rights Council, the UN report (Eleventh Session Agenda item 3, par 21) said, "The Mayor of Davao City has done nothing to prevent these killings, and his public comments suggest that he is, in fact, supportive." [52] Human Rights Watch reported that in 2001–2002, Duterte appeared on local television and radio and announced the names of "criminals", some of whom were later executed. [53] In July 2005 at a crime summit at the Manila Hotel , Duterte said, "Summary execution of criminals remains the most effective way to crush kidnapping and illegal drugs". [54]
Duterte has denied responsibility for the extrajudicial killings. He has also frequently announced his support for them. According to Reuters, "Duterte's loud approval for hundreds of execution-style killings of drug users and criminals over nearly two decades helped propel him to the highest office of a crime-weary land." [11] In 2009 Duterte said: "If you are doing an illegal activity in my city, if you are a criminal or part of a syndicate that preys on the innocent people of the city, for as long as I am the mayor, you are a legitimate target of assassination." [55] In 2015, Duterte confirmed his links to extrajudicial killings in Davao, and warned that, if elected president, he may kill up to 100,000 criminals. After the said confirmation, Duterte challenged human rights officials to file a case against him if they could provide evidence to his links with vigilante groups. [56] Following a December 1 phone call between Donald Trump and Duterte, the latter said Trump wished him "success," in his war on drugs, and looked forward to his visiting Washington in 2017. An estimated 4,800 persons had been killed in the preceding six months in which Chief of Police Ronald dela Rosa claims that not all deaths are drug-related. [57] [58]

Federalism advocacy
In September 2014, Duterte and former mayors and governors, calling themselves the Mindanao Council of Leaders, advocated for a federalist government. [59] A month later, Duterte attended an event sponsored by the Federal Movement for a Better Philippines in Cebu City . [60] In December 2014 Duterte held a summit entitled Mindanawons Forging Unity Toward a Federal System of Government. [61]

2016 Presidential campaign
As early as the first quarter of 2015, Duterte made hints to the media of his intention to run for president in the 2016 elections. However, he denied these plans numerous times amidst clamor from his supporters for him to run.
In January, Duterte said he would abolish Congress if he chose to run for President and was elected. [62] On November 21, in a private gathering with fraternity brothers from San Beda College of Law , Duterte formally announced his presidential bid and also finally accepted Alan Peter Cayetano 's offer to be his running mate, and named his daughter, Sara Duterte , as his substitute for Mayor. [63] [64]
In his campaign he said he would introduce a federal parliamentary form of government. He also promised to kill tens of thousands of criminals, and eradicate crime in six months. [65] [66]

Constitutional reform
Rodrigo Duterte campaigned for decentralization and a shift to federal government during the 2016 presidential election. In an October 2014 forum organized by Federal Movement for a Better Philippines in Cebu City prior to joining the presidential race, the then mayor of Davao City called for the creation of two federal states for Moro people as a solution to the problems besetting Mindanao . [67] Mayor Duterte said that Nur Misuari and his Moro National Liberation Front don't see eye-to-eye with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front which the administration of President Benigno Aquino III had inked a peace deal with. He also said that the "template of the Bangsamoro Basic Law is federal," but what is granted to the Bangsamoro should also be granted to other Moro groups and other regions in the country. [68] In a dialogue with the Makati Business Club prior to the elections, Duterte said he is open to "toning down the Constitution" in order to accommodate more foreign investors to the Philippines. [69] He also said he is open to up to 70 percent foreign ownership of businesses in the country and foreign lease of lands up to 60 years, but will "leave it to Congress to decide." [69]

Rape comments
At a campaign rally on April 12, 2016, Duterte told supporters that, as Mayor, he thought he "should have been first" to rape Jacqueline Hamill, an Australian missionary who was gang-raped and killed during the 1989 Davao hostage crisis . He recalled examining her corpse:
After being condemned for his comments, Duterte later apologized for the incident and acknowledged the comment as a "bad remark" saying he regretted his "gutter language" but would not apologize for being misinterpreted. He insists though that the remark was not a "joke" as reported by some media outlets, saying that he stated it in a narrative. He further said that he was not apologizing for stating the remark reasoning that he made the remark out of "utter anger" when he recalled the events. [71] He threatened to sever diplomatic ties with the US and Australia, if elected, after their ambassadors criticized his comments. [66]
His daughter Sara Duterte subsequently announced on social media that she was a rape victim , but would still vote for her father. He said that he doubted her story, jokingly referring to her as a "drama queen". [72]

Human rights
In a campaign speech on April 27 to business leaders, he said his presidency would be "a bloody one", but that he would issue "a thousand pardons a day" to police and soldiers accused of human rights abuses, and would also issue a presidential pardon to himself for mass murder at the end of his six-year term. [66]

Election to the Presidency
On May 30, 2016, the 16th Congress of the Philippines proclaimed Duterte as the President-elect of the Philippines after he topped the official count by the Congress of the Philippines for the 2016 presidential election with 16,601,997 votes, 6.6 million more than his closest rival, Mar Roxas . [73] [74] [75] Camarines Sur representative Leni Robredo on the other hand, was proclaimed as the Vice President-elect of the Philippines with 14,418,817 votes, narrowly defeating Senator Bongbong Marcos by 263,473 votes. [76]

Presidency
The Presidency of Rodrigo Duterte began at noon on June 30, 2016, when he became the 16th President of the Philippines , succeeding Benigno Aquino III .
At the age of 71, Duterte became the oldest person ever elected to the presidency. Duterte is also the first local chief executive to get elected straight to the Office of the President, the second Cebuano to become president (after Osmeña), the third Cebuano -speaking president (after Osmeña and Carlos P. Garcia ), the first Visayan from Mindanao and the fourth Visayan overall (after Osmeña, Manuel Roxas and Garcia). [80]
A Pulse Asia survey conducted from July 2–8 showed that Duterte had a trust rating of 91%, the highest of the six presidents since the Marcos dictatorship (the previous highest was Duterte's predecessor, Benigno Aquino III with 87%). [17] Shortly after his inauguration on June 30, Duterte held his first Cabinet meeting to lay out their first agenda, which included the country's disaster risk reduction management, decongesting the Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Manila, the country's main gateway, and expressed his ideas and concerns regarding the territorial disputes in the South China Sea prior to the announcement of the verdict of the Philippines' arbitration case against China over the issue, [81] which the Philippines later won. [82] Four days later, on July 4, Duterte issued his first executive order entitled "Reengineering the Office of the President Towards Greater Responsiveness to the Attainment of Development Goals", allowing his Cabinet Secretary , Leoncio Evasco, Jr. , to supervise over several agencies that focus on poverty reduction . [83] On July 23, Duterte signed Executive Order No. 2 also known as the Freedom of Information Order . [84]
On August 1, 2016, Duterte launched a 24-hour complaint office accessible to the public through a nationwide complaint hotline, 8888 , while also changing the country's emergency telephone number from 117 to 911 . [85]
On August 7, Duterte approved the burial of former President Ferdinand Marcos at the Heroes' Cemetery in Taguig scheduled for October 18, [86] saying that Marcos is qualified for the burial at the cemetery due to him being a "former president and a soldier". The decision was vehemently opposed, due to "the brutal, oppressive and corrupt nature of Marcos's two-decade regime." [87] An online petition which received over 30,000 signatures stated:
Following the September 2 bombing in Davao City that killed 14 people in the city's central business district, on September 3 Duterte declared a "state of lawlessness", and on the following day signed a declaration of a " state of national emergency on account of lawless violence in Mindanao". [88] The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and the Philippine National Police (PNP) were ordered to "suppress all forms of lawless violence in Mindanao" and to "prevent lawless violence from spreading and escalating elsewhere". Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea said that the declaration "does not specify the imposition of curfews", and would remain in force indefinitely. He explained: "The recent incidents, the escape of terrorists from prisons, the beheadings, then eventually what happened in Davao. That was the basis." [89]
In December 2016, Duterte was ranked 70th on Forbes list of The World's Most Powerful People . [90] [91] On December 7, Duterte signed Executive Order No. 10 creating a consultative committee to review the 1987 Constitution of the Philippines . [92] The latest target in Duterte's war on vice is tobacco products, when he signed Executive Order 26 imposing a smoking ban in all public places in the country on May 16, 2017. [93] In the same month, the Duterte administration began to implement the Anti-Distracted Driving Act . [94]
While adjusting to working and residing at the Malacañang Palace , Duterte divides his workweek between Manila and Davao City by spending three days in each city, utilizing the Malacañang of the South while in Davao. [95]

Domestic policy

Anti-drug campaign
In the first three months of Duterte's term in office, according to police figures, over 3,000 killings were attributed to his nationwide anti-drug campaign. More than half were attributed to vigilantes. At the beginning of October, a senior police officer told The Guardian that 10 "special ops" official police death squads had been operating, and that he had personally been involved in killing 87 suspects. He described how the corpses were dumped at the roadside ("salvage" victims), or had their heads wrapped in masking tape with a cardboard placard labelling them as a drug offender, so that the killing would not be investigated. The chairman of the Commission on Human Rights , Chito Gascon , was quoted in the report: "I am not surprised, I have heard of this." The Philippine National Police declined to comment. The report stated: "although the Guardian can verify the policeman's rank and his service history, there is no independent, official confirmation for the allegations of state complicity and police coordination in mass murder." [96]
Duterte has justified the drug war by claiming that the Philippines was becoming a " narco-state ". In October 2016, Amnesty International stated there is "little evidence" of this; according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime , the prevalence of drug use in the country is lower than the global average. [97] He has dismissed the UN's human rights concerns by dehumanizing drug users, stating in August 2016: "Crime against humanity? In the first place, I'd like to be frank with you. Are they humans? What is your definition of a human being?" [98] Despite the controversial war on Drugs, Duterte public approval remains at over 80% as of October 2016. [99]
During his presidential campaign and transition, Duterte called for the reimposition of capital punishment in the country to execute criminals involved in "heinous" crimes, such as illegal drug trade , insisting on hanging . [100] Capital punishment in the Philippines was abolished by President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo on June 24, 2006.
After his inauguration, Duterte spoke to journalists in Tondo, Manila , where he urged Filipino citizens to voluntarily kill drug pushers and addicts. [101] A day after his inauguration, Duterte requested for the New People's Army , the armed wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines , to "disarm and arrest" drug lords. [102]
That same day, police chief Ronald dela Rosa warned police officers and personnel involved in illegal drug trade with the option to voluntarily surrender within 48 hours or "take an absence without official leave, continue being a drug lord, and declare war against the police." [103] On July 5, 2016, Duterte revealed the names of five police officials who were allegedly involved in illegal drug trade. [104] On July 7, during a press conference, Duterte presented a chart identifying three Chinese nationals who serve as drug lords in the Philippines. [105] [106] Chief dela Rosa added that there are 23 mayors on Duterte's list of officials involved in illegal drug trade. [107]
The Philippine Daily Inquirer published a "kill list" documenting the extrajudicial killings of suspected criminals involved in drug trafficking by police. [108] Lawmakers responded with criticism to the rise of extrajudicial killings called by Duterte and demanded congressional inquiries and investigation on the incidents. Ifugao Representative Teddy Baguilat urged the Philippine House of Representatives to investigate the "spate of extrajudicial killings and/or summary executions of suspected violators of laws on illegal drugs and other suspected criminals," defending Article III, Section 1 of the Philippine Constitution which states that "no person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law, nor shall any person be denied the equal protection of the laws." [109] Senator and former Justice Secretary Leila de Lima urged Duterte's administration to cease the extrajudicial killings and said that she would file a resolution for the Philippine Senate to conduct an investigation, expressing worry that it could cause disorderly violence in communities. [110] While praising Duterte's effort to eradicate illegal drug trade, the militant group Bagong Alyansang Makabayan also asked Duterte to investigate the increasing number of extrajudicial killings, expressing concern over the deaths of alleged drug dealers. [111] The Duterte administration, through Presidential Spokesman Ernesto Abella , responded to the criticism by demanding critics to provide substantive evidence during investigation, which he says the administration is opened to cooperating with. [112] Since Duterte took office, the PNP has reported 5,617 drug-related deaths, 1,959 at the hands of the police. Some are the result of shoot-outs during drug bust operations, they say and 3,658 vigilante-style killings, usually performed by masked men on motorcycles in pursuit of marked targets. [113]

Mindanao insurgency
Nur Misuari's wife Tarhata Misuari received help from Duterte when he interceded on their behalf after the events of Zamboanga. [114] Duterte has said that Moro dignity is what the MILF and MNLF are struggling for, and that they are not terrorists. He acknowledged that the Moros were subjected to wrongdoing, historical and in territory. [115]
Duterte was endorsed in the election by Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) leader Nur Misuari [116] due to his background in Mindanao. [117] Jesus Dureza was his second choice. [118] Other Muslims also supported Duterte and denounced Roxas, the Aquino supported pick. [119]
During the Mindanao Hariraya Eid al-Fitr 2016 convention in Davao City on July 8, 2016, Duterte vowed to address the Moro conflict and bring peace in Mindanao, assuring the Filipino Muslim community that "something will change" before the end of his term. He said that the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) and the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) both support his proposal for federalism in the Philippines , which he says is the only solution to the Bangsamoro peace process. Duterte said that if the proposal for the country's shift to federalism fails or is not desired by the Filipino people, he will vow to pass the Bangsamoro Basic Law , which would establish the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region . He also added that the Basic Law should benefit both MILF and MNLF, saying he is willing to negotiate with both secessionists to initiate a "reconfiguration" of territory. [120] [121]
A crowd of Muslims were attending the speech by Duterte where he accused America of bringing terrorism to themselves, saying that terrorism is not the result of the Middle East. [122] He railed against the actions undertaken in the Middle East by the USA. [123] Duterte blamed the war on Mindanao on colonialist Christianity being brought to the Philippines in 1521 by Ferdinand Magellan saying there was peace before that, and that they were made to fight their "Malay brother" by Christians. [124]
The Bud Dajo Massacre inflicted upon the Moros was mentioned by President Duterte to criticize the United States and its President Barack Obama . [125] The massacre was cited a second time by Duterte in criticizing America while calling for the exit of American troops. [126]
On November 6, 2016, Duterte signed an executive order to expand the Bangsamoro Transition Commission to 21 members from 15, in which 11 will be decided by the MILF and 10 will be nominated by the government. The commission was formed in December 2013 and is tasked to draft the Bangsamoro Basic Law in accordance with the Framework Agreement on the Bangsamoro [127]
The MNLF and MILF both count some of Duterte's relatives in their ranks. [128] Criminals were treated ruthlessly by Duterte while the MILF, MNLF and NPA have received sympathetic treatment from him. [129] Duterte attacked terrorists and criminals and said there would be no ceasefire for them, while other groups like the MNLF, MILF and NPA all received a ceasefire from Duterte over the December holiday in 2016. [130] [131]
On May 23, 2017, Duterte declared a 60-day martial law in Mindanao following clashes between the AFP and the Maute group in Marawi , Lanao del Sur . [132] He said that the implementation is similar to Proclamation No. 1081 and expressed the possibility of extending the scope of the martial law nationwide if deemed necessary. [133]

Communist insurgency
In July 2016, Duterte directed his peace process advisor for the CPP–NPA–NDF rebellion, Silvestre Bello III , to lead a government panel in resuming peace talks with the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP), the New People's Army (NPA), and the National Democratic Front (NDF) in Oslo , Norway, expressing hope that a peace treaty between the rebellions would be reached within a year. [134] The first talks began on August 22–26, 2016, where the parties agreed upon were "the affirmation of previously signed agreements, the reconstitution of the Joint Agreement on Safety and Immunity Guarantees which 'protects the rights of negotiators, consultants, staffers, security and other personnel involved in peace nogtiations,' [135] and the accelerated progress for negotiations." [136] In February 2017, due to recent attacks and kidnapping of soldiers by members of the NPA despite the imposed ceasefire by the government and the rebel groups, President Duterte cancelled all negotiations with the CPP–NPA–NDF and labeled them a terrorist group . [137] He also ordered the arrest of all NDF negotiators. [138] Military offensive against the group resumed after Duterte's cancellation of ceasefire. [139]

Foreign policy
The Duterte administration has vowed to pursue an "independent foreign policy" that would reject any meddling by foreign governments, reiterating Article II , Section 7 of the 1987 Constitution which states: "The State shall pursue an independent foreign policy. In its relations with other states the paramount consideration shall be national sovereignty , territorial integrity , national interest , and the right to self-determination ." In September 2016, Duterte said: "We will observe and must insist on the time-honored principle of sovereignty, sovereign equality, non-interference and the commitment of peaceful settlements of dispute that will serve our people and protect the interests of our country." [20]
Duterte made his first international trips as president to Vientiane , Laos and Jakarta , Indonesia on September 5–9, 2016. [140]

China and Russia
Following his inauguration as president, Duterte mentioned his willingness to "reorient" his foreign policy towards China and Russia, particularly in the areas of trade and commerce. [141] During an interview with Al Jazeera , he expressed his willingness to conduct joint military exercises with China and Russia. [142] In September, Duterte said that he is considering purchasing military equipment, particularly weaponries and armaments, from China and Russia to strengthen the capabilities of the Armed Forces of the Philippines in addressing insurgency and counter-terrorism, saying that deals between the Philippines and the two countries are already in discussion and that the Chinese and Russian governments have offered the Philippines soft loans that would be payable in 2025. [143]
On October 18–21, 2016, Duterte visited Beijing to meet with Chinese officials, including President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang . While announcing his "separation" from the United States in front of Chinese and Filipino businessmen at the Philippines–China Trade and Investment Forum in Beijing on October 20, Duterte also said that he would realign himself with the Chinese ideological flow and that he might also travel to Russia to meet with President Vladimir Putin to "tell him that there are three of us against the world – China, Philippines, and Russia." [144] [145]
On November 20, Duterte met with Putin during the sidelines of the APEC summit in Lima , Peru . Duterte has praised Putin's leadership skills and called him his "idol". Putin also invited Duterte to visit Moscow . [146] [147] Duterte said that he would visit Moscow on May 25, 2017, where a defense cooperation agreement between the Philippines and Russia is expected to be finalized. [148]
During an interview with RT in November, Duterte said that the Philippines is "not ready" for military alliances with China and Russia due to the Mutual Defense Treaty signed between the Philippines and the U.S.; however, he clarified that the Philippines could seek stronger diplomatic cooperation with China and Russia, as well as other countries, "to make the world more peaceful." [149] Russian Ambassador to the Philippines Igor Khovaev expounded on Duterte's statement by saying that the Russian government is offering a strategic partnership with the Philippines, not a military alliance, and added that Russia does not believe in establishing military alliances with Asia. However, Khovaev explained that the Russian government is open to assisting the Philippines in purchasing Russian-made weaponry . [150]
On May 1, 2017, following a visit to three Chinese naval ships at the Port of Davao , Duterte expressed interest in conducting joint military exercises between the Philippine Armed Forces and China's People's Liberation Army in Mindanao, particularly in the Sulu Sea . [151]

Territorial disputes
On July 12, 2016, the Permanent Court of Arbitration tribunal in the Hague announced its ruling in favor of the Philippines in its case filed under the Benigno Aquino III administration in 2013 against China on issues regarding the South China Sea under the provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea , including the latter's nine-dash line claim which the tribunal ruled had no legal basis. [82] Three days after, during a testimonial dinner in San Juan , Duterte asked former President Fidel Ramos to lead the Philippine envoy to Beijing for bilateral negotiations with China over the disputes. [152] Ramos accepted the offer on July 23, [153] but resigned on October 31. [154] During his first State of the Nation Address on July 25, Duterte said that his administration "strongly affirms and respects" the ruling and would use it as a guide to negotiate for a resolution on the territorial disputes. [155] Duterte prefers to discuss the issue quietly and directly with China and has vowed not to raise the issue before the Association of Southeast Asian Nations . [156] [157] Duterte said "he would not want to antagonize China" and would want to "maintain good relations with China" to "create an environment where we sit down and talk directly." [157]
On October 12, Duterte declared his intention to terminate joint US–Philippine naval patrols in the South China Sea, which he believes could needlessly antagonize China. [158] His reticent approach with China contrasts with his otherwise "belligerent rhetoric and swaggering persona"; he has received support to some political ads from an anonymous Chinese donor. [159]
On October 20 in Beijing, Duterte and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to resume direct talks on the dispute. [160]
When then U.S. Secretary of State-designate Rex Tillerson threatened China's positions on the islands, the Philippines said that Tillerson was speaking for the U.S. only in the U.S.'s interest and prerogatives. [161] Delfin Lorenzana , Duterte's Defense Secretary, rejected the possibility of war against China over the islands in the South China Sea. [162]
On April 6, 2017, Duterte ordered the Armed Forces of the Philippines to occupy and fortify at least nine uninhabited islands in the South China Sea. He announced plans to visit the Philippine-administered Thitu (Pag-asa) Island during Independence Day and raise a Philippine flag there. [163] Duterte also ordered the Philippine Navy to build structures on the Benham Rise in order to reassure the Philippines' sovereignty over the undersea region, following the sighting of Chinese survey vessels . [164] He also announced plans to rename the Benham Rise to the Philippine Ridge. [165] On April 12, Duterte canceled his plan to visit the Thitu (Pag-asa) Island, citing goodwill and friendship with China. [166] On April 21, Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana announced the allocation of ₱1.6 billion to develop the Thitu (Pag-asa) Island, despite rejection from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs . [167] The development of the island is expected to include the construction of a marine research center , beaching facilities, a radio station, an ice plant , and a power station , as well as the improvement of the Rancudo airstrip runway. [168] On May 16, 2017, Duterte signed an executive order formally renaming the Benham Rise to the Philippine Rise. [169]

United States
On September 12, 2016, Duterte said that he is "not a fan of the Americans" and wants to "reorient" foreign policy with the United States. He requested that U.S. forces in Mindanao should leave the Philippines, specifically those who are part of the Operation Enduring Freedom , saying that it would "inflame the situation with the Abu Sayyaf ." [170] [171] Duterte said on September 13 that he does not plan to cut ties with the United States, but wants to reiterate the administration's pursuit of an "independent foreign policy" in accordance with the Constitution; the administration will continue to honor mutual agreements like the Visiting Forces Agreement and the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement . [172] On September 20, Duterte said: "I never said get out of the Philippines, for after all, we need them there in the China Sea. We don't have armaments." [173] [174]
On September 27, Duterte vowed not to allow the U.S. government to interfere with the policies of his administration. He criticized the U.S. government for "lecturing" his administration on human rights amidst their campaign on illegal drugs and said that he will " cross the Rubicon with the U.S." Duterte added that he plans to forge "new alliances" with China and Russia in trade and commerce. [175] U.S. Department of State deputy spokesperson Mark Toner responded to Duterte's criticisms by saying that the Philippine–U.S. relations could still remain "strong and unabated" despite Duterte's criticisms. [176] The following day, while addressing the Filipino community in Hanoi , Duterte said that the Balikatan military exercises and the joint naval patrols in the South China Sea between the Philippines and the U.S. in October would be "its last" in order to avoid provoking conflict with China. [177] [178]
On October 5, Duterte accused the U.S. of refusing to sell armaments to the Philippines and said that he would rather purchase armaments from China and Russia. [179] In an attempt to repair relations with the U.S., Duterte's Defense Secretary, Delfin Lorenzana , said Duterte was "misinformed" about the U.S. alliance: "Maybe, the defense ministry and the armed forces were remiss in providing him the correct information." [180]
On October 6, Duterte's then-Foreign Secretary Perfecto Yasay Jr. denounced the idea of the Philippines being regarded as a "little brown brother" by the U.S. [181] Yasay said that the Philippines had been "failed" by the U.S. [182] [183]
On October 20, while on a trip to Beijing , Duterte declared a "separation" from the United States which he declared that the U.S. had lost militarily, socially, and economically and emphasizes a realignment of the Philippines to move closer to China. [184] During a press conference after arriving from Beijing, Duterte clarified that what he meant by "separation" was a "separation of a foreign policy" and not a severance of diplomatic ties, saying that it would not be feasible to cut diplomatic ties with the U.S. due to the large number of Filipino Americans . [185] U.S. Department of State spokesperson John Kirby responded by saying: "We are going to be seeking an explanation of exactly what the president meant when he talked about separation from the U.S.; it's not clear what that means and all its ramifications." [186] On October 23, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Daniel R. Russel traveled to Manila to seek clarification and explanation for Duterte's comments with Philippine officials, including Foreign Affairs Secretary Perfecto Yasay Jr. and Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana. [187] [188]
On November 7, Secretary Lorenzana clarified that the joint Balikatan exercises will continue along with the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement, but the Cooperation Afloat Readiness and Training amphibious landing exercises between the Philippine Marine Corps and the U.S. Navy would be discontinued. He specified that bilateral drills on counter-terrorism , humanitarian response , special operations , engineering projects , and civic action will remain, all of which have been approved by Duterte. [189]
Following the 2016 U.S. presidential election , Presidential Communications Secretary Martin Andanar offered "warm congratulations" to Donald Trump on his election victory. He said that Duterte "looks forward to working with the incoming administration for enhanced Philippines-US relations anchored on mutual respect, mutual benefit and shared commitment to democratic ideals and the rule of law." [190] While in Kuala Lumpur , Duterte personally congratulated Trump by greeting him " Mabuhay! " and expressed hope that the Trump administration would honor obligations and treaties signed between the Philippines and the U.S. [191] On December 2, Duterte called President-elect Trump to personally congratulate him once more and invited him to visit the Philippines for the Twelfth East Asia Summit in 2017, while Trump invited Duterte to visit him in New York City and Washington, D.C. after the former's inauguration . [192] On April 29, 2017, President Trump called Duterte to inform him of his planned visit to the Philippines in November for the East Asia Summit. Trump also extended an invitation to Duterte to visit him at the White House . [193] During their call, Duterte urged Trump to show restraint in dealing with North Korea over their nuclear weapons program , warning him that the region could suffer "immensely". [194] Trump also praised Duterte's drug war during the call, telling him "I just wanted to congratulate you because I am hearing of the unbelievable job on the drug problem". [195] [196]

Economic performance
Duterte's expletive-laden outbursts have triggered the biggest exodus from stocks in a year and made the peso Asia's worst performer in September 2016. The Philippine currency is at a seven-year low and rounding out its worst month since May 2010, after Duterte lashed out at U.S. President Barack Obama and told off both the European Union and the United Nations for their criticisms of his violent anti-drug campaign, which has left more than 3,000 people dead. However, Duterte blames the U.S. for the currency's weakness, accusing it of "undermining" the Philippines by "manipulating" the exchange rate. [197] In the same month, the Philippine peso completed its biggest monthly decline since October 2000 amid the biggest outflow from the nation's stocks in a year. [198]
After 100 days in office, former president Ramos , a political ally-mentor of Duterte said that "Duterte has been a huge disappointment and letdown" and "the government was losing badly by prioritizing a war on drugs at the expense of issues like poverty, living costs, foreign investment and jobs". [199] [200]
Duterte's verbal attacks especially to the US and EU is viewed by Filipinos as a threat to their jobs especially those working for foreign companies. [201] Mark Williams, chief of Asia economist at Capital Economics said that "Certainly, investors are worried by some of the things he's saying, he's really unnerved people". [202] The Philippine government, however, expects that employment, especially in BPO industries, will continue to keep on rising. [203]
In December, government data reveals that The Philippines' output of nickel ore fell 16 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, after the country, which is the world's top supplier of the metal, suspended some mines in a clampdown on environmental violations. Production dropped to 19.8 million tonnes in the nine months to September from 25.97 million tonnes a year ago, according to the data. [204]

Presidential immunity
On November 7 Senator Leila de Lima , Duterte's chief government critic, filed a Supreme Court writ of habeas data against Duterte, testing the doctrine of presidential immunity, claiming "The verbal attacks on petitioner's womanhood and threats on her person are not covered by presidential immunity from suit because they are not the official act of a President". The 20-page writ asked, "Can a sitting President wage a personal vendetta against petitioner and use the resources of his powerful office to crucify her as a woman, a human being, and a duly elected senator in violation of her right to privacy in life, liberty and security?" [205] De Lima's counsel, De La Salle University College of Law dean Jose Manuel Diokno , said "Immunity cannot be used to block this case. There is a blatant violation of the magna carta for women, code of conduct for public officials. We hope the Supreme Court will listen to the plea of Senator de Lima and give consideration to this petition because we believe it is of groundbreaking importance". [206]
Duterte had repeatedly criticized De Lima for an alleged adulterous affair with her driver, and her alleged "propensity for sex". [206] He said in August 2016 that she was an "immoral woman" who had no right to criticize the extrajudicial killings because she had "a very sordid personal and official life". [207] She was subsequently removed from her position chairing a Senate committee investigating the killings, and was then forced to leave her home out of fears for her safety. [208] The writ cited several cases of Duterte admitting that he wanted to drive her to suicide. De Lima demanded to know which foreign country had assisted Duterte in his surveillance of her private conversations, as he had claimed, and how it was carried out. [209] [210]
Presidential spokesperson Ernesto Abella said that "Senator Leila de Lima is apparently playing the gender card as a shield against mounting evidence of her ties with high-profile drug lords and the proliferation of drug trade in the New Bilibid Prison ". Chief Presidential Legal Counsel Salvador Panelo said that "the president is immune from suit but even if he is not, the petition has no basis in fact nor in law". [211]

Controversy and criticism
In early September 2015, an infamous incident was reported of a tourist being forced to swallow his own cigarette butt in a local bar in Davao City after the tourist refused to comply with the public anti-smoking ordinance of the city. Duterte was personally contacted by the bar owner and went into the bar and forced the tourist to swallow his cigarette butt. Duterte was then met with criticisms especially from the Commission on Human Rights (CHR) . [212]
Referring to the arrest of a suspected rice smuggler, Duterte spoke out in the state senate saying, "If this guy would go to Davao and starts to unload (smuggled rice)… I will gladly kill him." For these comments, Duterte was attacked in an editorial in The Manila Times , which condemned "the mentality of lawlessness and vigilantism." [213] The newspaper argued that this culture of impunity enabled those in power, including officials, "private warlords and businessmen vigilantes" to take retribution against those they felt had acted against their interests: "They kill journalists exposing corruption and human rights activists exposing abusive police and military men." [213] Following Duterte's comments in relation to killing a person suspected of smuggling rice, the office of the President of the Philippines issued a statement saying, "Killing a person is against the law. The President has been firm in the belief that no one is above the law. We must not resort to extralegal methods." [214]
In October 2016, the French newspaper Libération depicted Duterte as a “serial killer president,” pertaining to the spate of drug-related killings in the Philippines. The newspaper report drew condemnation from the Filipino community in France. Presidential Spokesperson Ernesto Abella said in a radio interview that the newspaper's presentation of Duterte as a serial killer was "very unfair" and "irresponsible" while DILG Secretary Ismael Sueno stated that the description was "too much" and noted the lack of understanding over the administration's war on drugs. [215] [216] [217] As 2016 concluded, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) nominated Duterte as a runner-up in their 2016 Person of the Year Award that "recognizes the individual who has done the most in the world to advance organized criminal activity and corruption". [218] The OCCRP panel members who recognized Duterte noted his use of "death squads to slaughter drug dealers (and users)", with some panelists comparing his use of vigilante groups to those of the 2016 Person of the Year Award winner, Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro . [218]

International stage
In 1995, after Flor Contemplacion , a Filipino, was executed in Singapore after confessing to a double murder, Duterte, as Davao City mayor, allegedly burned a flag of Singapore (though this claim was later denied) and joined 1,000 employees of Davao City in protest. [219] [220]
Internationally, Duterte is known as the "dirty mouth" president. [221] He had, however, promised to behave in a "prim and proper" manner on the national and international stage once he was to be inaugurated as President, to the point that, "almost, I would become holy." [222]
In July 2016, Duterte accused the United Kingdom and the United States of importing terrorism to the Middle East through its interventions, saying: "The U.S. destroyed the Middle East. ... Great Britain and the U.S. will not admit that they forced their way to Iraq and killed Saddam. Look at Iraq now. Look what happened to Libya. Look what happened to Syria." [223] [224]
In August 2016, Duterte was criticized after he made a homophobic comment (using a Tagalog language slur) about the US Ambassador to the Philippines Philip Goldberg , stating "As you know, I'm fighting with (US Secretary of State John Kerry 's) ambassador. His gay ambassador, the son of a whore. He pissed me off." Duterte added: "He [Goldberg] meddled during the elections, giving statements here and there. He was not supposed to do that." The U.S. State Department summoned the Filipino chargé d'affaires Patrick Chuasoto to discuss Duterte's comments. [225] Duterte refused to apologize. [226]
In the same month, United Nations human rights experts called for an end to extrajudicial killings of suspected drug dealers, about 900 of whom had been executed since the May election, accusing Duterte of "incitement to violence and killing, a crime under international law". [227] In response, Duterte threatened to leave the UN and form a separate organization with China and African nations. He announced in a news conference on August 19: "You now, United Nations, if you can say one bad thing about me, I can give you 10 [about you]. I tell you, you are an inutil ("useless" in Filipino street language.). Because if you are really true to your mandate, you could have stopped all these wars and killing [in Syria and Iraq]." Asked about possible repercussions, he stated: "What is ... repercussions? I don't give a shit to them." He said that the UN had acted against protocol: "You do not just go out and give a shitting statement against a country." [19]
At the 2016 ASEAN Summit , Duterte and U.S. President Barack Obama planned to meet with each other. [228] The United States said that President Obama planned to discuss the 2,400 Filipinos who died during Duterte's war on drugs. [228] Duterte criticized the planned topic of the meeting, saying, "I am no American puppet . I am the president of a sovereign country and I am not answerable to anyone except the Filipino people. You must be respectful. Do not just throw away questions and statements. Son of a whore, I will curse you in that forum." [229] The vulgar insult prompted the White House to cancel the meeting instead. [230] During a press conference at the 2016 G20 Hangzhou summit in China, President Obama discussed the cancellation of the meeting, saying: "I always want to make sure that if I'm having a meeting, that it's actually productive and we're getting something done." [231] Obama and Duterte later met informally. [232]
On September 30, 2016, Duterte appeared to compare the killings of suspected drug addicts to the Holocaust saying: " Hitler massacred three million Jews. Now, there are 3 million drug addicts. ... I'd be happy to slaughter them." [233] His remarks drew international outrage particularly from the Jewish Communities. World Jewish Congress president Ronald S. Lauder condemned the statement, [234] as did the Anti-Defamation League . [235] Israeli Foreign Ministry also condemned his remarks while the German government slammed Duterte's comments as unacceptable, and called in the Philippine ambassador to the Foreign Ministry over the matter. [236] [237] [238] On October 2 he apologized to the Jewish community. [239] When listening to the full conference, [240] [241] he was in fact referring to the accusation of genocide by lawyers of the European Union who wanted him to face the International Court of Justice and, as Presidential spokesman Ernesto Abella explained, that it "was an oblique reflection of the way he has been pictured as a mass murderer, a Hitler, a label he rejects". [242]
In September 2016, Duterte said that the United States has not even apologized to the Philippines for its atrocities during the Philippine–American War . [170] In October 2016, Duterte continued his tirade against the US and the European Union saying in Tagalog that "Mr. Obama, you can go to hell. EU, better choose purgatory. Hell is already full. Why should I be afraid of you?" [243]
Duterte's constant cursing had local officials worried that the Philippines would lose foreign aid from the United States and European Union. He responded that “If you think it is high time for you guys to withdraw your assistance, go ahead. We will not beg for it. We have a problem here trying to preserve our society" he said. The President continued that he would “be the first to go hungry. I will be the first one to die of hunger". Local actress Agot Isidro responded in Tagalog "First of all, no one's trying to fight you. As a matter of fact, you're the one who's picking a fight. Secondly, the country where you are elected as President by 16 million out of 100+ million is Third World. You talk as if the Philippines is a superpower. Excuse me, we don't want to go hungry. If you want, you do it yourself. Leave us out of it. So many people have nothing to eat, and yet you'll starve us even further". [244] Her sentiments were echoed by Senator Panfilo Lacson adding that "if the economy worsen, the entire Filipino people will be affected, they will go hungry as well". [245]
Former president Fidel Ramos on his resignation as special envoy to China stated that he did not like Duterte's treatment of US president Barack Obama and lambasted the administration on its refusal to ratify the Paris Agreement on Climate Change which was later agreed by Duterte. [246] [247] [248]
During the 2016 APEC Summit in Peru, President Duterte skipped two major events due to jet lag. In a press conference at his office in Makati, Former president Ramos hit the absence of Duterte at the APEC gala dinner and the shoot for the leaders’ traditional family photo. Ramos said that while Duterte and his Cabinet may have thought that the two events are negligible, it could have disappointed the host country. “Peru President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski must be very disappointed,” Ramos said. He said the gala night could have been an opportunity for Duterte to exchange ideas with world leaders and sickness is an unacceptable alibi to skip such an important gathering. [249]

Catholic Church
Duterte has referred to the Catholic Church as "the most hypocritical institution", after the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines president Socrates Villegas released a pastoral letter indirectly referring to Duterte as a "morally reprehensible" candidate who has shown "scant regard" for the rights of others and the teachings of the Church, urging Filipino Catholics to not vote for him. [250] [251] [252] Unlike many prominent conservative politicians, [253] [254] [255] Duterte has spoken in favor of birth control, LGBT rights, and reimposition of the death penalty which was abolished by President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo , a devout Catholic, during her second term in 2006. [256] [257] [258] Upon being elected, Duterte called local bishops "sons of whores", and said he would expand family planning, which the Church had been opposed to. The Catholic Church in the Philippines had lost much of its popularity and political power since being active in overthrowing the Marcos regime in 1986 . Antonio Contreras, a political science professor at De La Salle University in Manila, said that Duterte's attacks on the Church were likely to prove popular. [259]
Duterte was accused of having referred to Pope Francis as a "son of a whore" [259] during the pontiff's visit to the Philippines in January 2015 because it caused traffic congestion , though he immediately apologized publicly, explaining he wasn't using these words in regards to the Pope but rather a rant to the government's way of preparing the Pope's visit. [260] On December 4, 2015, Duterte, along with his executive assistant Bong Go, visited and talked with Davao Archbishop Romulo Valles and Bishop George Rimando, together with Monsignor Paul Cuison to get lectured on Christian Values. Duterte committed to lessen his profanity in public gatherings and even assured that he would donate ₱1,000 to Caritas Davao every time he swears in public. He also stated that he will be planning to visit the Vatican at a later time. [261] Duterte however canceled his planned trip and instead wrote a letter to Pope Francis dated January 21, 2016. During a campaign rally in Ubay, Bohol , Duterte's camp showed the letter coming from the Vatican's Secretariat of State, signed by Giovanni Angelo Becciu dated February 24, stating that Pope Francis had received his letter and that the Vatican appreciated Duterte's apology after allegedly cursing Pope Francis in public. [262] In January 2017, Duterte wrote a personal letter to Pope Francis, expressing his gratitude during his papal visit in the Philippines and his "highest esteem and respect" for the pontiff. [263]
On August 28, 2016, Luis Antonio Tagle , the Archbishop of Manila, acknowledged that people were right to be "worried about extrajudicial killing". He said that it was equivalent to abortion, "unfair labor practices", "wasting food" and selling illegal drugs, explaining that these are all "form[s] of murder". [264] On August 31, in a speech before a gathering of a religious group in Davao City, Duterte said that he once considered being a priest: "It's good I didn't join the priesthood," said Duterte, "or else now I would be a homosexual." [265]

Views on media killings
The Philippines is one of the most dangerous countries for journalists, with 174 assassinations recorded since the Marcos dictatorship. In a press conference on 31 May 2016, Duterte said that "Most of those killed, to be frank, have done something. You won't be killed if you don't do anything wrong." He appeared to announce his support for killing "corrupt" journalists: "Just because you're a journalist you are not exempted from assassination if you're a son of a bitch".
At the press conference where Duterte announced this, he wolf-whistled at a female journalist ( Mariz Umali of GMA News ) when she asked a question. [266] At a news conference on the following day he defended his comments and refused to apologise, telling reporters, "I cannot protect you". He has been criticized by foreign and domestic media organizations regarding his comments. [267] The Southeast Asia representative of the Committee to Protect Journalists said: "What he has done with these irresponsible comments is give security officials the right to kill for acts that they consider defamation. This is one of the most outrageous statements we have ever heard from a president in the Philippines." [268]
Melinda Quintos de Jesus, executive director of the Center for Media Freedom, stated in October 2016 that major newspapers and television stations have not critically analyzed Duterte's policies, because "they fear him. They basically are afraid to be singled out." [269]

Personal killings
Duterte has repeatedly admitted to killing three people while he was the Mayor of Davao. In December 2015, Duterte recounted shooting three gunmen dead only months into his first mayoral term in 1988 after they had kidnapped and raped a Chinese girl. He justified his actions, saying "they were committing a crime in my presence and I was the person in authority under the law". [15] In an interview with BBC on 16 December 2016, he said: "I killed about three of them, because there were three of them. I don't know how many bullets from my gun went inside their bodies. It happened, and I said, I cannot lie about it". [16]
On 14 December 2016, Duterte gave a speech to business leaders in the presidential palace where he spoke of personally killing suspected criminals as Mayor of Davao to set an example for local police. He said, "In Davao I used to do it personally. Just to show to the guys that if I can do it why can't you. And I'd go around in Davao with a motorcycle, with a big bike around, and I would just patrol the streets, looking for trouble also." [16] [270] [271]

Personal life
Duterte is known for being an avid fan of big bikes but detests luxury cars. He once owned a second-hand Harley Davidson and currently a Yamaha Virago . He was once a habitual smoker but he eventually quit after a doctor's suggestion due to health concerns. Duterte is an avid reader of Robert Ludlum and Sidney Sheldon novels. [272] Duterte is also known for his straightforward and vocal attitude in public especially in interviews, showing no hesitation in using profanity profusely live on-screen on numerous occasions despite formal requests by media groups and schools beforehand to abstain. [273] [274]
Duterte has his own local show in Davao City called Gikan Sa Masa, Para Sa Masa ("From the Masses, For the Masses") aired as a blocktimer on ABS-CBN Davao . He is also a member of Lex Talionis Fraternitas , a fraternity based in the San Beda College of Law and the Ateneo de Davao University . [275]
In addition to his native Cebuano , Duterte is also reasonably fluent in English and Tagalog .

Family
Duterte has siblings named Eleanor Duterte; Benjamin "Bong" Duterte, a one-term city councilor of Davao between 1992 and 1995; younger sister Jocelyn Duterte, who lost in several attempts to grab a Third District city council seat as well as for the mayor post in 2001; and Don "Blue Boy" Duterte who ran and lost in the First District congressional race in 1998.
Duterte was once married to Elizabeth Abellana Zimmerman , a flight attendant who hails from Davao City and is of German American descent who also traces her roots in Tuburan, Cebu . They together have three children (from eldest to youngest): Paolo ("Pulong"), Sara ("Inday Sara") and Sebastian ("Bastê"). Paolo and Sara ventured into politics while Baste, with no interest in politics, concentrated on business and surfing. [273] Paolo married twice, first with Lovelie Sangkola whom he had separated with, and second with January Navares-Duterte, his current wife. [276] Sara is currently married to a fellow lawyer while Baste has two kids: a daughter with a former girlfriend and a son with current girlfriend Kate Necesario. [277] In 2012, Duterte made a notorious remark in a media interview regarding an incident where Paolo's name was allegedly linked to a carnapping ( portmanteau of car and kidnapping ) syndicate led by Ryan Yu. Duterte is infamously quoted as having said: "Kill my son Paolo if he is involved in crime." Paolo was never charged for lack of evidence and eventually won the Davao City vice mayoralty in 2013. [278] Duterte's father Vicente died in 1968 while his mother Soledad died on February 4, 2012, at the age of 95. [279] Zimmerman was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer in 2015. [280]
Duterte has been publicly very open about his infidelity and philandering while married to Zimmerman and cited it as the reason for his failed first marriage when asked in interviews. In 1998, Zimmerman filed a petition with the Regional Trial Court in Pasig to nullify her marriage. Duterte never appeared in court and did not contest Zimmerman's petition. Two years later, the court decided in her favor, ending the 27-year marriage of Duterte and Zimmerman. Duterte and Zimmerman have been on good terms in recent years with Zimmerman stating, "Yes, [Rodrigo] is really a very good leader. That is all he is. But when it comes to family, he is not capable of taking care of it." In 2001, Zimmerman eventually ran for a seat on the city council but lost. Duterte and Zimmerman are said to have patched things up and appear to be civil to each other, 15 years after their marriage was declared null and void. Zimmerman eventually joined the campaign trail for Duterte's presidential candidacy in early 2016 called Byaheng Du30 in which she would travel by bus to major cities together with her daughter Sara and a number of delegates. [280]
Duterte is currently living with his common-law wife Cielito "Honeylet" Avanceña, a nurse, with whom he has one daughter named Veronica ("Kitty"). Duterte has eight grandchildren, half of whom are Muslims and the other half Christian. [281] [282]

Ancestry
Rodrigo Duterte has identified himself as hailing from both Cebu and Leyte. His heritage includes Portuguese, Spanish, Chinese, Arabic, Malaysian, as well as indigenous descent.
On his paternal side, he shares familial ties with some of the prominent families of the Visayas, particularly the Almendrases & Duranos of Danao, Cebu . [283]
His maternal lineage is part-Chinese but mostly Moro of indigenous Maranao-Kamayo descent, with distant traces of Islamic royalty. [284]

Religion
Despite being raised as a communicant of the Catholic Church , on January 19, 2016, while meeting with businessmen in Binondo , Manila, Duterte clarified that he has not attended Mass for quite some time already since he deemed it incompatible with his mayoral responsibilities: "If I listened to the Ten Commandments or to the priests" said Duterte, "I would not be able to do anything as a mayor". He then clarified that he still believes in God, but not in religion. [286] On June 26, 2016, Duterte said he's Christian , but also said that he believes "in one god Allah ". [251] [287]

Health
Duterte has Buerger's disease , an inflammation of blood vessels, mostly in the limbs, and Barrett's esophagus , wherein esophageal cells are gradually replaced by gastrointestinal cells. He has denied rumors of throat cancer . [288]

Prescription drug use
Duterte admitted in December 2016 that he had been a user of the addictive opioid drug Fentanyl . He said that a doctor prescribed the drug to alleviate back pain and headaches, but that he would take more than he was prescribed: "I was only given a fourth of [the whole patch], but no more, because of course my doctor learned that I was using the whole patch because I felt better". [289] Fentanyl is described by the US National Institute on Drug Abuse as "a powerful synthetic opioid analgesic that is similar to morphine but is 50 to 100 times more potent". [290] Duterte later denied that he was a drug addict, and a spokesman stated that he was not affected by side-effects of the drug, which include confusion, anxiety and hallucinations . [291]
Duterte has "bragged about his Viagra -fuelled serial adultery", [292] drawing criticism from the GABRIELA Women's Party . [293] He told supporters at a rally in 2015: "When I was young, I could do overnight, which is more expensive. When I got old, I could do short time only because I have such a short time left. After one erection, that’s it. No more. Without Viagra, it’s even more difficult." [294] Despite one of its representatives Luz Ilagan once stated that the people should focus on his track record and not on his womanizing ways, GABRIELA national chairperson Emmi de Jesus reiterated its stance against Duterte. [293]

2017 Manchester Arena bombing
On 22 May 2017, a suicide bombing was carried out at Manchester Arena in Manchester , England, after a concert by American singer Ariana Grande . The attacker was identified by police as Salman Ramadan Abedi, a 22-year-old Briton of Libyan ancestry who detonated an improvised explosive device as concertgoers were leaving the arena. Twenty-three people, including Abedi, were killed and approximately 120 were injured.

Attack
On 22 May 2017, at around 22:30 BST ( UTC+01:00 ), [2] a suicide bomber detonated an improvised explosive device, packed with nuts and bolts to act as shrapnel , in the foyer area of the Manchester Arena . The attack took place after an Ariana Grande concert that was part of her 2017 Dangerous Woman Tour . [3] [4] The concert was sold out and up to 21,000 people may have attended, [5] many of whom were exiting through the foyer at the time of the explosion.
Greater Manchester Police declared the incident a terrorist attack, identifying it as a suicide bombing . It was the deadliest attack in the United Kingdom since the 7 July 2005 London bombings [6] and the first in Manchester since the 1996 bombing by the Provisional IRA . [a]

Aftermath
About three hours after the bombing, a controlled explosion was conducted by police on a suspicious item in Cathedral Gardens , [7] later found to be an item of clothing. [8]
Residents and taxi companies in Manchester offered free transport or accommodation via Twitter to those left stranded at the concert. [9] Parents of children attending the concert were separated in the aftermath of the explosion. A nearby hotel served as a shelter for children displaced by the bombing, with their parents being directed there by officials. [10] Manchester's Sikh temples ( Gurdwaras ) along with local homeowners, hotels and venues offered shelter to victims of the attack. [11]
Manchester Victoria railway station , which is partly underneath the arena, was evacuated and closed, and services were cancelled. [3] [12] The station remained closed for several days. [13]
The Arndale shopping centre was evacuated for a time during an unrelated arrest on the day following the attack. [14] On Wednesday, 24 May, a radio BBC 5 studio was evacuated at 2:00 pm while live on air, as was a departure-level drop off at Terminal 1 of Manchester Airport . A second brief evacuation of a Salford University building occurred at about 4:00 pm. [15]
After a COBRA meeting with Greater Manchester's Chief Constable , Ian Hopkins , Prime Minister Theresa May announced that the UK's terror threat level was being raised to "critical", its highest level. [16] Operation Temperer was then activated for the first time, allowing up to 5,000 soldiers to reinforce armed police in protecting parts of the country. [17] [18] Tours of the Houses of Parliament and the Changing of the Guard ceremony at Buckingham Palace were cancelled on the following day, [ when? ] and troops were deployed to guard government buildings in London. [19]

Casualties
Twenty-two concert-goers were killed in the blast and about 120 were injured, [20] [21] including 59 who were taken to hospital, of whom twenty remained in critical condition as of 24 May. [22] North West Ambulance Service reported that 60 of its ambulances attended the scene, carried 59 people to local hospitals, and treated a number of walking wounded on site. [23] Of the hospitalised, 12 were reported to be children under the age of 16. All of the 22 dead had been named by the evening of 25 May. They included seven young girls—one eight-year-old [24] and six others aged 14 to 19—and an off-duty police officer. [25]

Attacker
The bomber, Salman Ramadan Abedi, was a 22-year-old Briton from a Muslim family. [26] [27] He was born in Manchester on 31 December 1994 to a family of refugees from Libya who had settled in south Manchester after becoming opponents of Colonel Gaddafi's regime. [28] [29] He grew up in the Whalley Range area and lived in Fallowfield . [30]
He was known to British security services but was not regarded as a high risk. [31] A community worker told the BBC he had called a hotline five years before the bombing to warn police about Abedi's views and members of Britain’s Libyan diaspora said they had "warned authorities for years" about Manchester's Islamist radicalisation . [32] [33] Abedi was reported to authorities about his extremism five time in the past five years. [34]
Abedi's parents, both born in Tripoli , returned to Libya in 2011 following Muammar Gaddafi’s death , [30] while Abedi stayed in the United Kingdom. Abedi attended Burnage Academy for Boys in Manchester between 2009 and 2011, before going to the Manchester College until 2013 and then in 2014 enrolled at the University of Salford , where he studied business management. Abedi later dropped out to work in a bakery. [28] According to an acquaintance, Abedi was "outgoing" and consumed alcohol until 2012. Another acquaintance said Abedi was a "regular kid who went out and drank" until about 2016. [35] According to the BBC, "Friends remember him as a good footballer, a keen supporter of Manchester United and a user of cannabis. He had a sister and two brothers." [28]
Abedi, his older brother [36] and his father worshipped at Didsbury Mosque . [31] [30] A senior person at the mosque recalled that Abedi looked at him "with hate" after he preached against ISIS and Ansar al-Sharia in 2015. [37]

Investigation
The property in Fallowfield where Abedi lived became a focus of the police investigation following the bombing. Armed police breached the house with a controlled explosion and searched it. Abedi's 23-year-old brother Ismael was arrested in Chorlton-cum-Hardy in south Manchester in relation to the attack. [38] [39] Police carried out operations [ clarification needed ] in two other areas of south Manchester and another address in the Whalley Range area. [39] Three other men were arrested, and police talked about a likely "network" supporting the bomber. [32]
Two days after the attack, Abedi's 54-year-old father and 20-year-old younger brother were arrested by security forces in Tripoli. [40] According to German intelligence, Abedi had returned to the UK from Turkey four days prior to the attack. [41]
Following the emergence of information that he had recently returned from Syria, intelligence agencies are attempting to establish whether Abedi acted alone, or whether he was part of a terrorist network. [42] [43] The French interior minister, Gérard Collomb , told a French TV channel that Abedi may have gone to Syria and had "proven" links with ISIS. Abedi's father and younger brother were arrested by the Libyan authorities on 23 and 24 May respectively. His younger brother was suspected of planning an attack in Libya, and was said to be in regular touch with Salman and aware of the plan to bomb the Manchester Arena. [44]
Photographs of the remains of the IED published by The New York Times indicated that it had comprised an explosive charge inside a lightweight metal container which was carried within a black vest or a blue Karrimor backpack. Most of the fatalities occurred in a ring around the bomber. His torso was propelled by the blast through the doors to the arena, possibly indicating that the explosive charge was held in the backpack and blew him forward on detonation. A small device thought to have possibly been a hand-held detonator was also found. [45] US Congressman Michael McCaul , chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee , indicated that the bomb contained the explosive TATP , which has been used in previous bombings. [46]
As of 25 May, eight people have been held in police custody. [47]

News leaks
Within hours of the attack, Abedi's name and other information given confidentially to security services in the United States and France was leaked to the news media , leading to condemnation from Home Secretary Amber Rudd . [48] [49] The BBC reported that the UK government and police reacted with "fury" following the publication of apparent photos of the attack site by a US newspaper, and the evidence relating to the backpack bomb published by The New York Times , saying that the release of the material was detrimental to the investigation. [50] On 25 May, Greater Manchester Police said that it had stopped sharing information on the attack with the US intelligence services. Prime Minister Theresa May said she would make clear to President Trump that "intelligence that has been shared must be made secure." [51] Trump described the leaks to the news media as "deeply troubling", and pledged to carry out a full investigation. [52] British officials blamed the leaks on "the breakdown of normal discipline at the White House and in the US security services". [53]

Reactions

United Kingdom
Prime Minister Theresa May and Leader of the Opposition Jeremy Corbyn both condemned the bombing, [54] [55] while the Queen expressed her sympathy to the families of the victims. [56] Campaigning for the general election was suspended by all political parties for two days after the attack. [57] [58] The Mayor of Greater Manchester , Andy Burnham , called the attack "evil" [59] and announced a vigil to be held in Albert Square the following evening. [60] Burnham, Corbyn, Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow and Home Secretary Amber Rudd were in attendance. [61] British Muslim groups, such as the Muslim Council of Britain [62] [63] [64] condemned the attack.
On 24 May 2017, Theresa May raised the threat level to critical for the first time since 2007, meaning "not only that an attack remains highly likely but a further attack may be imminent". [65]

International
Condolences were expressed by the leaders and governments of dozens of countries, [66] United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres , [67] Commonwealth Secretary-General Patricia Scotland , [68] President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker , [69] Pope Francis , [70] and Secretary General of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation Yousef Al-Othaimeen . [71]
Ariana Grande posted on her official Twitter account: "broken. from the bottom of my heart, i am so so sorry. i don't have words." [72] Grande subsequently suspended her tour and returned home to Florida . [73] [74]

Controversies
In 2015, while Theresa May was Home Secretary, a 18% funding cut in the police force had taken place with the loss of around 20,000 police officers. Before the bombing and after the Paris attacks , she was warned by a Manchester senior police officer that the cuts on the force and community policing risked terror attacks in the city due the lack of resources to carry out proper intelligence gathering and achieve anti-terrorist measures. [75] [76] [77]
In May 25 during the 2017 NATO summit , President of the United States Donald Trump linked large-scale immigration to the terror attack and stated that NATO should "include a great focus on terrorism and immigration." [78]

Rising Pune Supergiant
The Rising Pune Supergiant (often abbreviated as RPS ) was a cricket team based in Pune , Maharashtra , India that played in the Indian Premier League from 2016-17. The team along with Gujarat Lions were featuring as two-season replacements for Chennai Super Kings and Rajasthan Royals , who were suspended due to their involvement in illegal betting by their respective owners.
The Rising Pune Supergiant franchise is owned by RP-Sanjiv Goenka Group controlled by Sanjiv Goenka . [1] The team name was announced (as Rising Pune Supergiants ) on 18 January 2016 by Goenka in Kolkata and Raghu Iyer was appointed CEO. [2] The owners changed the team name to Rising Pune Supergiant on 26 March 2017. [3] The team lost the 2017 IPL Final to Mumbai Indians by 1 run, which was the team's last game in the IPL. [ citation needed ]

Home ground
The Rising Pune Supergiant's home ground was the Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium in Pune. However, controversies arose over holding 2016 IPL games in Maharashtra due to water usage of the cricket stadiums during severe drought and the Bombay High Court ordered all matches in May to be shifted out of the state. [4] On 15 April 2016, it was reported that the Rising Pune Supergiants were considering the ACA- VDCA Cricket Stadium in Vishakhapatnam as an alternate home ground. [5]

Results summary

By season
The Rising Pune Supergiants made an excellent start to the season, convincingly winning their first game against the defending champions, Mumbai Indians , by 9 wickets. However, they went on to lose their next four games - against the Gujarat Lions , Kings XI Punjab , Royal Challengers Bangalore and the Kolkata Knight RIders . The inclusion of Ashoke Dinda , in their 6th game of the season, provided a brief inspiration as the Supergiants beat the Sunrisers Hyderabad by 34 runs. They lost the next two games - against the Gujarat Lions and the Mumbai Indians - at the Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium in Pune. The Supergiants were also briefly bolstered by the arrival of Australian batsmen Usman Khawaja and George Bailey against the Delhi Daredevils at the Feroz Shah Kotla and went on to win the game by 7 wickets. In the last match held in Visakhapatnam against the Kings XI Punjab the team was struggling to win despite a good start by the openers and losing wickets in intervals, they needed 23 from 6 balls in last over and the Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni standing in the crease; the Captain has hit 3*6 and 1*4 to win the match in a thrilling way and scoring 64 runs from 32 balls. After the end of the 2016 IPL, the Supergiants won only 5 games out of 14, and won only 2 of their 7 home games - 4 at the MCA Stadium in Pune and 3 at their new home ground, the ACA-VDCA Cricket Stadium i n Vishakhapatnam . They finished placed at seventh place in the points table.
After the auction, Pune axed MS Dhoni as captain and Steve Smith was appointed captain barely months before the start of the 2017 season. The franchise then changed their name to Rising Pune Supergiant , removing the 's', on 26 March 2017. [3] [6] Washington Sundar replaced Ravichandran Ashwin who was ruled out of the tournament with a sports hernia. RPS bought Ben Stokes for ₹14.5 Crore at the auction, making him the most expensive overseas player in the history of the IPL. Imran Tahir was roped in by RPS as a replacement for Mitchell Marsh , who was once again ruled out of the tournament due to a shoulder injury. This decision proved to be extremely decisive, as Imran Tahir went on to take 18 wickets in 12 games for RPS before leaving for his national team, along with Faf du Plessis .
RPS once again got off to a great start in IPL 2017 by beating the Mumbai Indians by 7 wickets in their first game. However, losses against Kings XI Punjab , Delhi Daredevils and Gujarat Lions followed and it seemed like Pune were repeating what took place last year. However, results picked up and RPS won 7 out of their next 8 games, all of them by close margins, with the top performers being Rahul Tripathi , Jaydev Unadkat , Ben Stokes and Imran Tahir . But a 6-day gap left them rusty and RPS lost to Delhi Daredevils by 7 runs, forcing them to win their last game vs Punjab to qualify. In their do-or-die game vs Punjab, RPS skittled them out for 73 and won comfortably by 9 wickets, thus finishing in second place with 18 points and qualifying for the play-offs.
RPS faced the Mumbai Indians in Qualifier 1 at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, with a win securing them a spot in the final. RPS batted first and posted a slightly below-par total of 162-4, with 41 runs coming from the last two overs, thanks to well-paced innings from Manoj Tiwary and Ajinkya Rahane and a late surge from MS Dhoni . Washington Sundar ripped apart the middle order of the Indians and finished with career best figures of 3-16 in 4 overs. Shardul Thakur and Jaydev Unadkat chipped in as Pune beat the Mumbai Indians comfortably by 20 runs.
RPS faced the Mumbai Indians for the fourth time in the season, in the final at Hyderabad . This was Rising Pune Supergiant's last game in the IPL. RPS had a psychological edge over Mumbai, considering RPS had beaten them on all three meetings in the season. Rohit Sharma won the toss and decided to bat first. Jaydev Unadkat and Adam Zampa took key wickets as Mumbai crumbled to 79-7 but a late surge from Krunal Pandya meant that Mumbai finished with a slightly-below par score of 129-8. RPS looked comfortable after the powerplay but over-cautious batting cost them dearly. Ajinkya Rahane scored runs easily but captain Steve Smith struggled and things took a turn when Rahane got out for 44. MS Dhoni arrived but was quickly removed for 10 and Pune were left requiring 11 runs from the last over with Smith and Manoj Tiwary at the crease. Tiwary hit a four on the first ball off Mitchell Johnson 's bowling and RPS looked to have the trophy in the bag. But Smith and Tiwary got out off consecutive deliveries which left RPS requiring 7 runs from 3 balls. A single from Washington Sundar and a double from Daniel Christian meant RPS required 4 runs from the last ball. Unfortunately, RPS could only complete two runs before Sundar was run out. Thus, Mumbai Indians won by 1 run to get their 3rd IPL title. RPS left the tournament empty-handed but they won the hearts of fans throughout the world.

Salvador Sobral
Salvador Vilar Braamcamp Sobral (born 28 December 1989) is a Portuguese singer, who won the 2017 Eurovision Song Contest in Kiev , Ukraine for Portugal with the song " Amar pelos dois ", written by his sister Luísa Sobral . [1] He gave Portugal its first ever win in the contest since the country's debut in 1964 , ending the longest winless run by a country in Eurovision history (53 years). He and his entry currently hold the record of being the highest-scoring winner in Eurovision history, earning a total of 758 points under the current voting system after winning both the jury vote and televote. [2] [3]

Early life
Sobral was born in Lisbon and has lived there most of his life. He was born into a formerly noble family, [4] [5] the son of Salvador Luís Cabral Braamcamp Sobral and Luísa Maria Cabral Posser Vilar. His paternal grandparents are Salvador José de Almeida Braamcamp Sobral and Maria Elisa Perestrelo de Matos de Figueiredo Cabral; and his maternal grandparents are João Luís Posser de Andrade Vilar and Luísa Maria de Melo Breyner Freire Cabral. The politician Hermano José Braamcamp de Almeida Castelo Branco was his great-great-great-great-grandfather.
At the age of ten, he participated in the TV programme Bravo Bravíssimo , and at 20 he was one of the ten finalists of Ídolos , the Portuguese version of the Idols franchise. As a finalist, he sang music by Stevie Wonder , Leonard Cohen and Rui Veloso . [6]
He studied Psychology at the Instituto Superior de Psicologia Aplicada ( pt ) , in Lisbon . He spent time in Mallorca as an Erasmus student, where he started singing in bars. [7]
Salvador Sobral is a fan of Chet Baker and bossa nova singers including Caetano Veloso and Chico Buarque . [7] He speaks four languages: Portuguese, Spanish, English and a little Italian. [8]

Career

2009–15: 
In 2009, he competed on season three of Ídolos , Portugal's version of the Idols franchise. [9] He finished seventh in the competition. His sister, Luísa Sobral , is also a singer who previously placed third on season one of Ídolos . [10] After he left the Psychology program, he applied to the Taller de Músics ( ca ) , a music school in Barcelona , where he finished his studies in 2014. [7] In 2015, he participated in the Vodafone Mexefest [11] and EDP Cool Jazz [12] festivals.

2016–present: 
On 2 August 2016, Sobral released his debut single "Excuse Me" as the lead single from his debut studio album. On the same day he released his debut studio album Excuse Me . [7] The album peaked at number 10 on the Portuguese Album Chart . "Nem Eu" was released as the second single from the album on 27 October 2016. In 2017, Sobral was confirmed to be taking part in Festival da Canção 2017 , with the song " Amar pelos dois ". [13] He went on to win the competition on 5 March 2017, and represented Portugal in the Eurovision Song Contest 2017 . [14] He could not perform in the first rehearsals because of a serious heart condition that forced him to rest ahead of the performance in the semi. [15] His sister took over the role of singer during the first rehearsals. [15] He won the final with 758 points, which under the current voting system represents the highest scoring winner who won the contest . [16] [17] In July 2017 he will participate in the Super Bock Super Rock festival in Lisbon, accompanied by the pianist Júlio Resende ( pt ) with whom he has a project titled Alexander Search . [18]

Activism
Sobral drew attention to the European migrant crisis by attending the first semi-final winners' press conference in an 'S.O.S. Refugees ' shirt. [19] "If I'm here and I have European exposure, the least thing I can do is a humanitarian message," he said. "People come to Europe in plastic boats and are being asked to show their birth certificates in order to enter a country. These people are not immigrants, they're refugees running from death. Make no mistake. There is so much bureaucratic stuff happening in the refugee camps in Greece, Turkey and Italy and we should help create legal and safe pathways from these countries to their destiny countries," he added, earning a round of applause. [20]
Later the EBU imposed a ban preventing him from wearing the shirt for the remainder of the contest. [21] The EBU argued that Sobral's shirt was being used as a "political message", violating the rules of the contest. [21] Sobral argued at his winners' press conference, however, that it held a humanitarian message, not political one. [22]

Ransomware
Ransomware is a type of malicious software that blocks access to the victim's data or threatens to publish or delete it until a ransom is paid. Any action is possible once a device or system is infected and there is no guarantee that paying the ransom will return access or not delete the data. Simple ransomware may lock the system in a way which is not difficult for a knowledgeable person to reverse. More advanced malware uses a technique called cryptoviral extortion , in which it encrypts the victim's files, making them inaccessible, and demands a ransom payment to decrypt them. [1] The ransomware may also encrypt the computer's Master File Table (MFT) [2] [3] or the entire hard drive. [4] Thus, ransomware is a denial-of-access attack that prevents computer users from accessing files [5] since it is intractable to decrypt the files without the decryption key . Ransomware attacks are typically carried out using a Trojan that has a payload disguised as a legitimate file.
While initially popular in Russia , the use of ransomware scams has grown internationally; [6] [7] [8] in June 2013, security software vendor McAfee released data showing that it had collected over 250,000 unique samples of ransomware in the first quarter of 2013, more than double the number it had obtained in the first quarter of 2012. [9] Wide-ranging attacks involving encryption-based ransomware began to increase through Trojans such as CryptoLocker , which procured an estimated US $3 million before it was taken down by authorities, [10] and CryptoWall, which was estimated by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to have accrued over $18m by June 2015. [11] .

Operation
The concept of file encrypting ransomware was invented and implemented by Young and Yung at Columbia University and was presented at the 1996 IEEE Security & Privacy conference. It is called cryptoviral extortion and is the following three-round protocol carried out between the attacker and the victim. [12]
The symmetric key is randomly generated and will not assist other victims. At no point is the attacker's private key exposed to victims and the victim need only send a very small ciphertext (the encrypted symmetric-cipher key) to the attacker.
Ransomware attacks are typically carried out using a Trojan , entering a system through, for example, a downloaded file or a vulnerability in a network service. The program then runs a payload , which locks the system in some fashion, or claims to lock the system but does not (e.g., a scareware program). Payloads may display a fake warning purportedly by an entity such as a law enforcement agency , falsely claiming that the system has been used for illegal activities, contains content such as pornography and "pirated" media . [13] [14] [15]
Some payloads consist simply of an application designed to lock or restrict the system until payment is made, typically by setting the Windows Shell to itself, [16] or even modifying the master boot record and/or partition table to prevent the operating system from booting until it is repaired. [17] The most sophisticated payloads encrypt files, with many using strong encryption to encrypt the victim's files in such a way that only the malware author has the needed decryption key. [12] [18] [19]
Payment is virtually always the goal, and the victim is coerced into paying for the ransomware to be removed—which may or may not actually occur—either by supplying a program that can decrypt the files, or by sending an unlock code that undoes the payload's changes. A key element in making ransomware work for the attacker is a convenient payment system that is hard to trace. A range of such payment methods have been used, including wire transfers , premium-rate text messages , [20] pre-paid voucher services such as Paysafecard , [6] [21] [22] and the digital currency Bitcoin . [23] [24] [25] A 2016 census commissioned by Citrix revealed that larger businesses are holding bitcoin as contingency plans. [26]

History

Encrypting ransomware
The first known malware extortion attack, the "AIDS Trojan" written by Joseph Popp in 1989, had a design failure so severe it was not necessary to pay the extortionist at all. Its payload hid the files on the hard drive and encrypted only their names , and displayed a message claiming that the user's license to use a certain piece of software had expired. The user was asked to pay US$ 189 to "PC Cyborg Corporation" in order to obtain a repair tool even though the decryption key could be extracted from the code of the Trojan. The Trojan was also known as "PC Cyborg". Popp was declared mentally unfit to stand trial for his actions, but he promised to donate the profits from the malware to fund AIDS research. [27]
The idea of abusing anonymous cash systems to safely collect ransom from human kidnapping was introduced in 1992 by Sebastiaan von Solms and David Naccache [28] . This money collection method is a key feature of ransomware. In the vos Solms-Naccache scenario a newspaper publication was used (since bitcoin ledgers did not exist at the time the paper was written).
The notion of using public key cryptography for data kidnapping attacks was introduced in 1996 by Adam L. Young and Moti Yung . Young and Yung critiqued the failed AIDS Information Trojan that relied on symmetric cryptography alone, the fatal flaw being that the decryption key could be extracted from the Trojan, and implemented an experimental proof-of-concept cryptovirus on a Macintosh SE/30 that used RSA and the Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA) to hybrid encrypt the victim's data. Since public key crypto is used, the cryptovirus only contains the encryption key. The attacker keeps the corresponding private decryption key private. Young and Yung's original experimental cryptovirus had the victim send the asymmetric ciphertext to the attacker who deciphers it and returns the symmetric decryption key it contains to the victim for a fee. Long before electronic money existed Young and Yung proposed that electronic money could be extorted through encryption as well, stating that "the virus writer can effectively hold all of the money ransom until half of it is given to him. Even if the e-money was previously encrypted by the user, it is of no use to the user if it gets encrypted by a cryptovirus". [12] They referred to these attacks as being " cryptoviral extortion", an overt attack that is part of a larger class of attacks in a field called cryptovirology , which encompasses both overt and covert attacks. [12]
Examples of extortionate ransomware became prominent in May 2005. [29] By mid-2006, Trojans such as Gpcode , TROJ.RANSOM.A, Archiveus , Krotten, Cryzip, and MayArchive began utilizing more sophisticated RSA encryption schemes, with ever-increasing key-sizes. Gpcode.AG, which was detected in June 2006, was encrypted with a 660-bit RSA public key. [30] In June 2008, a variant known as Gpcode.AK was detected. Using a 1024-bit RSA key, it was believed large enough to be computationally infeasible to break without a concerted distributed effort. [31] [32] [33] [34]
Encrypting ransomware returned to prominence in late 2013 with the propagation of CryptoLocker —using the Bitcoin digital currency platform to collect ransom money. In December 2013, ZDNet estimated based on Bitcoin transaction information that between 15 October and 18 December, the operators of CryptoLocker had procured about US$27 million from infected users. [35] The CryptoLocker technique was widely copied in the months following, including CryptoLocker 2.0 (though not to be related to CryptoLocker), CryptoDefense (which initially contained a major design flaw that stored the private key on the infected system in a user-retrievable location , due to its use of Windows' built-in encryption APIs), [24] [36] [37] [38] and the August 2014 discovery of a Trojan specifically targeting network-attached storage devices produced by Synology . [39] In January 2015, it was reported that ransomware-styled attacks have occurred against individual websites via hacking, and through ransomware designed to target Linux -based web servers . [40] [41] [42]
The Microsoft Malware Protection Center recently identified a trend away from WSF files in favor of LNK files and PowerShell scripting. These LNK shortcut files install Locky ransomware by automating infection operations rather than relying on traditional user downloads of WSF files—all of which is made possible by the universal PowerShell Windows application . Unfortunately, cyber criminals have been able to leverage PowerShell for their attacks for years. In a recent report, the application was found to be involved in nearly 40% of endpoint security incidents . While attackers have been finding weaknesses in the Windows operating system for years, it’s clear that there’s something problematic with PowerShell scripting. [43]
Some ransomware strains have used proxies tied to Tor hidden services to connect to their command and control servers, increasing the difficulty of tracing the exact location of the criminals. [44] [45] Furthermore, dark web vendors have increasingly started to offer the technology as a service . [45] [46] [47]
Symantec has classified ransomware to be the most dangerous cyber threat. [48]

Non-encrypting ransomware
In August 2010, Russian authorities arrested nine individuals connected to a ransomware Trojan known as WinLock. Unlike the previous Gpcode Trojan, WinLock did not use encryption. Instead, WinLock trivially restricted access to the system by displaying pornographic images, and asked users to send a premium-rate SMS (costing around US$10) to receive a code that could be used to unlock their machines. The scam hit numerous users across Russia and neighboring countries—reportedly earning the group over US$16 million. [15] [49]
In 2011, a ransomware Trojan surfaced that imitated the Windows Product Activation notice, and informed users that a system's Windows installation had to be re-activated due to "[being a] victim of fraud". An online activation option was offered (like the actual Windows activation process), but was unavailable, requiring the user to call one of six international numbers to input a 6-digit code. While the malware claimed that this call would be free, it was routed through a rogue operator in a country with high international phone rates, who placed the call on hold, causing the user to incur large international long distance charges. [13]
In February 2013, a ransomware Trojan based on the Stamp.EK exploit kit surfaced; the malware was distributed via sites hosted on the project hosting services SourceForge and GitHub that claimed to offer "fake nude pics" of celebrities. [50] In July 2013, an OS X -specific ransomware Trojan surfaced, which displays a web page that accuses the user of downloading pornography. Unlike its Windows-based counterparts, it does not block the entire computer, but simply exploits the behavior of the web browser itself to frustrate attempts to close the page through normal means. [51]
In July 2013, a 21-year-old man from Virginia, whose computer coincidentally did contain pornographic photographs of underaged girls with whom he had conducted sexualized communications, turned himself in to police after receiving and being deceived by ransomware purporting to be an FBI message accusing him of possessing child pornography. An investigation discovered the incriminating files, and the man was charged with child sexual abuse and possession of child pornography. [52]

Leakware (also called Doxware)
The converse of ransomware is a cryptovirology attack that threatens to publish stolen information from the victim's computer system rather than deny the victim access to it. [53] In a leakware attack, malware exfiltrates sensitive host data either to the attacker or alternatively, to remote instances of the malware, and the attacker threatens to publish the victim's data unless a ransom is paid. The attack was presented at West Point in 2003 and was summarized in the book Malicious Cryptography as follows, "The attack differs from the extortion attack in the following way. In the extortion attack, the victim is denied access to its own valuable information and has to pay to get it back, where in the attack that is presented here the victim retains access to the information but its disclosure is at the discretion of the computer virus". [54] The attack is rooted in game theory and was originally dubbed "non-zero sum games and survivable malware". The attack can yield monetary gain in cases where the malware acquires access to information that may damage the victim user or organization, e.g., reputational damage that could result from publishing proof that the attack itself was a success.

Mobile ransomware
With the increased popularity of ransomware on PC platforms, ransomware targeting mobile operating systems have also proliferated. Typically, mobile ransomware payloads are blockers, as there is little incentive to encrypt data since it can be easily restored via online synchronization. [55] Mobile ransomware typically targets the Android platform, as it allows applications to be installed from third-party sources. [55] [56] The payload is typically distributed as an APK file installed by an unsuspecting user; it may attempt to display a blocking message over top of all other applications, [56] while another used a form of clickjacking to cause the user to give it "device administrator" privileges to achieve deeper access to the system. [57]
Different tactics have been used on iOS devices, such as exploiting iCloud accounts and using the Find My iPhone system to lock access to the device. [58] On iOS 10.3 , Apple patched a bug in the handling of JavaScript pop-up windows in Safari that had been exploited by ransomware websites. [59]

Notable examples

Reveton
In 2012, a major ransomware Trojan known as Reveton began to spread. Based on the Citadel Trojan (which itself, is based on the Zeus Trojan), its payload displays a warning purportedly from a law enforcement agency claiming that the computer has been used for illegal activities, such as downloading unlicensed software or child pornography . Due to this behaviour, it is commonly referred to as the "Police Trojan". [60] [61] [62] The warning informs the user that to unlock their system, they would have to pay a fine using a voucher from an anonymous prepaid cash service such as Ukash or Paysafecard. To increase the illusion that the computer is being tracked by law enforcement, the screen also displays the computer's IP address , while some versions display footage from a victim's webcam to give the illusion that the user is being recorded. [6] [63]
Reveton initially began spreading in various European countries in early 2012. [6] Variants were localized with templates branded with the logos of different law enforcement organizations based on the user's country; for example, variants used in the United Kingdom contained the branding of organizations such as the Metropolitan Police Service and the Police National E-Crime Unit . Another version contained the logo of the royalty collection society PRS for Music , which specifically accused the user of illegally downloading music. [64] In a statement warning the public about the malware, the Metropolitan Police clarified that they would never lock a computer in such a way as part of an investigation. [6] [14]
In May 2012, Trend Micro threat researchers discovered templates for variations for the United States and Canada , suggesting that its authors may have been planning to target users in North America. [65] By August 2012, a new variant of Reveton began to spread in the United States, claiming to require the payment of a $ 200 fine to the FBI using a MoneyPak card. [7] [8] [63] In February 2013, a Russian citizen was arrested in Dubai by Spanish authorities for his connection to a crime ring that had been using Reveton; ten other individuals were arrested on money laundering charges. [66] In August 2014, Avast Software reported that it had found new variants of Reveton that also distribute password stealing malware as part of its payload. [67]

CryptoLocker
Encrypting ransomware reappeared in September 2013 with a Trojan known as CryptoLocker , which generated a 2048-bit RSA key pair and uploaded in turn to a command-and-control server, and used to encrypt files using a whitelist of specific file extensions . The malware threatened to delete the private key if a payment of Bitcoin or a pre-paid cash voucher was not made within 3 days of the infection. Due to the extremely large key size it uses, analysts and those affected by the Trojan considered CryptoLocker extremely difficult to repair. [23] [68] [69] [70] Even after the deadline passed, the private key could still be obtained using an online tool, but the price would increase to 10 BTC—which cost approximately US$2300 as of November 2013. [71] [72]
CryptoLocker was isolated by the seizure of the Gameover ZeuS botnet as part of Operation Tovar , as officially announced by the U.S. Department of Justice on 2 June 2014. The Department of Justice also publicly issued an indictment against the Russian hacker Evgeniy Bogachev for his alleged involvement in the botnet. [73] [74] It was estimated that at least US$3 million was extorted with the malware before the shutdown. [10]

CryptoLocker.F and TorrentLocker
In September 2014, a wave of ransomware Trojans surfaced that first targeted users in Australia , under the names CryptoWall and CryptoLocker (which is, as with CryptoLocker 2.0, unrelated to the original CryptoLocker). The Trojans spread via fraudulent e-mails claiming to be failed parcel delivery notices from Australia Post ; to evade detection by automatic e-mail scanners that follow all links on a page to scan for malware, this variant was designed to require users to visit a web page and enter a CAPTCHA code before the payload is actually downloaded, preventing such automated processes from being able to scan the payload. Symantec determined that these new variants, which it identified as CryptoLocker.F , were again, unrelated to the original CryptoLocker due to differences in their operation. [75] [76] A notable victim of the Trojans was the Australian Broadcasting Corporation ; live programming on its television news channel ABC News 24 was disrupted for half an hour and shifted to Melbourne studios due to a CryptoWall infection on computers at its Sydney studio. [77] [78] [79]
Another Trojan in this wave, TorrentLocker , initially contained a design flaw comparable to CryptoDefense; it used the same keystream for every infected computer, making the encryption trivial to overcome. However, this flaw was later fixed. [36] By late-November 2014, it was estimated that over 9,000 users had been infected by TorrentLocker in Australia alone, trailing only Turkey with 11,700 infections. [80]

CryptoWall
Another major ransomware Trojan targeting Windows, CryptoWall, first appeared in 2014. One strain of CryptoWall was distributed as part of a malvertising campaign on the Zedo ad network in late-September 2014 that targeted several major websites; the ads redirected to rogue websites that used browser plugin exploits to download the payload. A Barracuda Networks researcher also noted that the payload was signed with a digital signature in an effort to appear trustworthy to security software. [81] CryptoWall 3.0 used a payload written in JavaScript as part of an email attachment, which downloads executables disguised as JPG images. To further evade detection, the malware creates new instances of explorer.exe and svchost.exe to communicate with its servers. When encrypting files, the malware also deletes volume shadow copies, and installs spyware that steals passwords and Bitcoin wallets . [82]
The FBI reported in June 2015 that nearly 1,000 victims had contacted the bureau's Internet Crime Complaint Center to report CryptoWall infections, and estimated losses of at least $18 million. [11]
The most recent version, CryptoWall 4.0, enhanced its code to avoid antivirus detection, and encrypts not only the data in files but also the file names. [83]

Fusob
Fusob is one of the major mobile ransomware families. Between April 2015 and March 2016, about 56 percent of accounted mobile ransomwares was Fusob. [84]
Like a typical mobile ransomware, it employs scare tactics to extort people to pay a ransom. [85] The program pretends to be an accusatory authority, demanding the victim to pay a fine from $100 to $200 USD or otherwise face a fictitious charge. Rather surprisingly, Fusob suggests using iTunes gift cards for payment. Also, a timer clicking down on the screen adds to the users’ anxiety as well.
In order to infect devices, Fusob masquerades as a pornographic video player. Thus, victims, thinking it is harmless, unwittingly download Fusob. [86]
When Fusob is installed, it first checks the language used in the device. If it uses Russian or certain Eastern European languages, Fusob does nothing. Otherwise, it proceeds on to lock the device and demand ransom. Among victims, about 40% of them are in Germany with the United Kingdom and the United States following with 14.5% and 11.4% respectively.
Fusob has lots in common with Small, which is another major family of mobile ransomware. They represented over 93% of mobile ransomwares between 2015 and 2016.

WannaCry
In May 2017, the WannaCry ransomware attack spread through the Internet, using an exploit vector that Microsoft had issued a "Critical" patch for ( MS17-010 ) two months before on March 14, 2017. The ransomware attack infected over 75,000 users in over 99 countries, using 20 different languages to demand money from users using Bitcoin cryptocurrency. WannaCry demanded $300 per computer. [87] The attack affected Telefónica and several other large companies in Spain, as well as parts of the British National Health Service (NHS), where at least 16 hospitals had to turn away patients or cancel scheduled operations, [88] FedEx , Deutsche Bahn , as well as the Russian Interior Ministry and Russian telecom MegaFon . [89] The Shadow brokers gave their victims a 7 day deadline from the day their computers got infected. [90]

Mitigation
As with other forms of malware, security software might not detect a ransomware payload, or, especially in the case of encrypting payloads, only after encryption is under way or complete, particularly if a new version unknown to the protective software is distributed. [91] If an attack is suspected or detected in its early stages, it takes some time for encryption to take place; immediate removal of the malware (a relatively simple process) before it has completed would stop further damage to data, without salvaging any already lost. [92] [93]
Alternately, new categories of security software, specifically deception technology , can detect ransomware without using a signature-based approach. Deception technology utilizes fake SMB shares which surround real IT assets. These fake SMB data shares deceive ransomware, tie the ransomware up encrypting these false SMB data shares, alert and notify cyber security teams which can then shut down the attack and return the organization to normal operations. There are multiple vendors [94] that support this capability with multiple announcements in 2016. [95]
Security experts have suggested precautionary measures for dealing with ransomware. Using software or other security policies to block known payloads from launching will help to prevent infection, but will not protect against all attacks. Keeping "offline" backups of data stored in locations inaccessible to the infected computer, such as external storage drives, prevents them from being accessed by the ransomware, thus accelerating data restoration. [23] [96]
There are a number of tools intended specifically to decrypt files locked by ransomware, although successful recovery may not be possible. [2] [97] If the same encryption key is used for all files, decryption tools use files for which there are both uncorrupted backups and encrypted copies (a known-plaintext attack in the jargon of cryptanalysis ); recovery of the key, if it is possible, may take several days. [98]

Battle of Montijo
The Battle of Montijo was fought on 26 May 1644, in Montijo , Spain , between Portuguese and Spanish forces. Although the battle ended with a Portuguese victory, [23] [24] the Spanish saw it as a strategic success as they claimed to have prevented Matias de Albuquerque from capturing Badajoz, [12] despite Albuquerque having no intention of attacking the city. [25] [26] [27] Due to the chaotic nature of the battle, casualty figures vary.

Background
Portuguese General Matias de Albuquerque knew the Spanish were commanded by the Marquis of Torrecusa , a renowned military tactician, and wanted to affirm his own presence. He managed to gather 6,000 infantry, 1,100 cavalry and 6 cannons, in order to give battle . He crossed the frontier attacking, pillaging and burning Vilar del Rey, Puebla and Boca de Manfarete until reaching the town of Montijo , which surrendered without a fight. [19]

Battle
Not having encountered the Spanish army, Matias de Albuquerque decided to return to Alentejo . [25] [26] [27] While on march, the Portuguese were confronted by a Spanish force from Torrecusa's army led by the Baron of Mollingen consisting of 4,000 infantry and 1,700 cavalry . On 26 May 1644 the two armies met not far from Montijo.
The forces of Mollingen adopted a semi circle formation, which would permit a simultaneous attack on the Portuguese front and flanks. Matias de Albuquerque , marching in a slow pace towards Portugal, had prepared for a rear attack by placing the infantry in two defensive lines with the strongest formations in the rear, the baggage wagons in the vanguard and the cavalry split between the two flanks.
The six cannons of the Portuguese initiated the hostilities, the Spanish side soon replied, but very ineffectively. The Spanish cavalry attacked the Portuguese left flank, routing the 150 Dutch cavalry commanded by Captain Piper. [19] [28] [29] The panic spread to the rest of the cavalry on both flanks who abandoned the field through their own lines, taking refuge in woods near Xévora, leaving the infantry disorganized. Led by Mollingen himself, the Spanish cavalry easily opened a breach in the centre of the Portuguese positions, taking the Portuguese artillery . Thinking that the Battle was won, Mollingen troops scattered themselves without care on the field looting. [19] Albuquerque's horse was killed and he was found fighting on foot by a French officer named Lamorlé (fighting for the Portuguese) who gave him his own horse.
Taking advantage of the Spanish lack of reserves and dispersion, Matias de Albuquerque and his officers rallied some of the scattered troops and quickly retook the Portuguese artillery. [19] D. João da Costa , a Portuguese artillery officer, efficiently used the artillery to stop the Spanish forces from regrouping. [30] The rallied Portuguese troops took back the field, [31] [32] and drove the Spaniards across the Guadiana inflicting heavy losses. [33] [34] [35]

Aftermath
On the following day the Portuguese troops returned to Campo Maior . [19] Both sides claimed victory, as well as having caused high casualties to each other. When news of the victory achieved by Albuquerque reached King John IV of Portugal he awarded the general with the title of Count of Alegrete. [36] Madrid , as well as Lisbon rejoiced with news of the battle [18] that had great repercussion in the European courts . [37] [38]

In Culture
The Spanish playwrights Pedro Francisco Lamini and Sr. Durán composed respectively the comedy El más valiente Extremeño, Bernardo del Montijo, el segundo Don Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar and the poem in his collection Romances vulgares de valentías, guapezas y desafueros in honor to the Battle. [39] The Portuguese João Soares da Gama also did it in his Batalha do Montijo . [39]

Pilgrims (Plymouth Colony)
The Pilgrims or Pilgrim Fathers were early European settlers of the Plymouth Colony in present-day Plymouth, Massachusetts , United States. The Pilgrims' leadership came from the religious congregations of Brownist English Dissenters who had fled the volatile political environment in England for the relative calm and tolerance of 16th–17th century Holland in the Netherlands . The Pilgrims held Calvinist religious beliefs similar to the Puritans but, unlike many Puritans, maintained that their congregations needed to be separated from the English state church . As a separatist group, they were also concerned that they might lose their English cultural identity if they emigrated to the Netherlands, so they arranged with English investors to establish a new colony in North America. The colony was established in 1620 and became the second successful English settlement in North America (after the founding of Jamestown, Virginia in 1607). While seeking religious freedom for their own group, the Pilgrims exhibited intolerance to other faiths. [1] The Pilgrims' story became a central theme of the history and culture of the United States . [2]
By this time, non-English European colonization of the Americas was also under way in New Netherland , New France , Essequibo , Colonial Brazil , Barbados , the Viceroyalty of Peru , and New Spain .

History

Separatists in Scrooby
The core of the group that came to be known as the Pilgrims were brought together between 1586 and 1605 by a common belief in the ideas promoted by Richard Clyfton , a Brownist parson at All Saints' Parish Church in Babworth , near East Retford , Nottinghamshire . This congregation held Separatist beliefs comparable to nonconforming movements (i.e., groups not in communion with the Church of England ) led by Robert Browne , John Greenwood , and Henry Barrowe . Separatists held that their differences with the Church of England were irreconcilable and that their worship should be organized independently of the trappings, traditions, and organization of a central church—unlike the Puritan group, who maintained their membership in and allegiance to the Church of England. [3] William Brewster , a former diplomatic assistant to the Netherlands, was living in the Scrooby manor house, serving as postmaster for the village and bailiff to the Archbishop of York . He had been favorably impressed by Clyfton's services, and had begun participating in Separatist services led by John Smyth in Gainsborough, Lincolnshire . [4]
The Separatists had long been controversial. Under the 1559 Act of Uniformity , it was illegal not to attend official Church of England services (unless the church was a signatory to the allegiance to the Church of England, as the Puritan church was, for example), with a fine of one shilling (£0.05; about £17 today [5] ) for each missed Sunday and holy day. The penalties for conducting unofficial services included imprisonment and larger fines. Under the policy of this time, Barrowe and Greenwood were executed for sedition in 1593.
During much of Brewster's tenure (1595–1606), the Archbishop was Matthew Hutton . He displayed some sympathy to the Puritan cause, writing to Robert Cecil , Secretary of State to James I in 1604:
It had been hoped, when James came to power, that a reconciliation would be possible which allowed independence, but the Hampton Court Conference of 1604 denied substantially all the concessions requested by Puritans, save for an English translation of the Bible . Following the Conference in 1605, Clyfton was declared a nonconformist and stripped of his position at Babworth. Brewster invited Clyfton to live at his home.
Upon Hutton's death in 1606, Tobias Matthew was appointed as his replacement. Matthew was one of James' chief supporters at the 1604 conference, [7] and he promptly began a campaign to purge the archdiocese of nonconforming influences, both Separatists and those wishing to return to the Catholic faith. Disobedient clergy were replaced, and prominent Separatists were confronted, fined, and imprisoned. He is credited with driving recusants out of the country, those who refused to attend Anglican services. [8] [9]
At about the same time, Brewster arranged for a congregation to meet privately at the Scrooby manor house. Services were held beginning in 1606, with Clyfton as pastor, John Robinson as teacher, and Brewster as the presiding elder. Shortly thereafter, Smyth and members of the Gainsborough group moved on to Amsterdam . [10] Brewster is known to have been fined £20 (about £3.89 thousand today [5] ) in absentia for his non-compliance with the church. [11] This followed his September 1607 resignation from the postmaster position, [12] about the time that the congregation had decided to follow the Smyth party to Amsterdam. [3] [13]
Scrooby member William Bradford of Austerfield kept a journal of the congregation's events that later was published as Of Plymouth Plantation . Of this time, he wrote:

Leiden
They lived in Leiden, Holland , a city of 100,000 inhabitants, [14] residing in small houses behind the "Kloksteeg" opposite the Pieterskerk . The success of the congregation in Leiden was mixed. Leiden was a thriving industrial center, [15] and many members were well able to support themselves working at Leiden University or in the textile, printing, and brewing trades. Others were less able to bring in sufficient income, hampered by their rural backgrounds and the language barrier; for those, accommodations were made on an estate bought by Robinson and three partners. [16]
Bradford wrote of their years in Leiden:
Brewster had been teaching English at the university, and Robinson enrolled in 1615 to pursue his doctorate . There he participated in a series of debates, particularly regarding the contentious issue of Calvinism versus Arminianism (siding with the Calvinists against the Remonstrants ). [18] Brewster acquired typesetting equipment about 1616 in a venture financed by Thomas Brewer, and began publishing the debates through a local press. [19]
The Netherlands, however, was a land whose culture and language were strange and difficult for the English congregation to understand or learn. They found the Dutch morals much too libertine, and their children were becoming more and more Dutch as the years passed. The congregation came to believe that they faced eventual extinction if they remained there. [20]

Decision to leave Holland
By 1617, the congregation was stable and relatively secure, but there were ongoing issues that needed to be resolved. Bradford noted that many members of the congregation were showing signs of early aging, compounding the difficulties which some had in supporting themselves. A few had spent their savings and so gave up and returned to England. It was feared that more would follow and that the congregation would become unsustainable. The employment issues made it unattractive for others to come to Leiden, and younger members had begun leaving to find employment and adventure elsewhere. Also compelling was the possibility of missionary work, an opportunity that rarely arose in a Protestant stronghold. [21]
Reasons for departure are suggested by Bradford when he notes the "discouragements" of the hard life which they had in the Netherlands, and the hope of attracting others by finding "a better, and easier place of living"; the children of the group being "drawn away by evil examples into extravagance and dangerous courses"; the "great hope, for the propagating and advancing the gospel of the kingdom of Christ in those remote parts of the world." [21]
Edward Winslow 's list was similar. In addition to the economic worries and missionary possibilities, he stressed that it was important for the people to retain their English identity, culture, and language. They also believed that the English Church in Leiden could do little to benefit the larger community there. [22]
At the same time, there were many uncertainties about moving to such a place as America. Stories had come back from there about failed colonies. There were fears that the native people would be violent, that there would be no source of food or water, that exposure to unknown diseases was possible, and that travel by sea was always hazardous. Balancing all this was a local political situation that was in danger of becoming unstable. The truce was faltering in what came to be known as the Eighty Years' War , and there was fear over what the attitudes of Spain might be toward them. [21]
Candidate destinations included Guiana , where the Dutch had already established Essequibo , or somewhere near the existing Virginia settlements. Virginia was an attractive destination because the presence of the older colony might offer better security and trade opportunities. It was thought, however, that they should not settle too near, since that might too closely duplicate the political environment back in England. The London Company administered a territory of considerable size in the region. The intended settlement location was at the mouth of the Hudson River . This made it possible to settle at a distance which allayed concerns of social, political, and religious conflicts, but still provided the military and economic benefits of relative closeness to an established colony. [23]

Negotiations
Robert Cushman and John Carver were sent to England to solicit a land patent. Their negotiations were delayed because of conflicts internal to the London Company, but ultimately a patent was secured in the name of John Wincob on June 9 ( Old Style )/June 19 (New Style), 1619. [24] The charter was granted with the king's condition that the Leiden group's religion would not receive official recognition. [25]
Preparations stalled because of the continued problems within the London Company. Competing Dutch companies approached the congregation and discussed with them the possibility of settling in the Hudson River area. [25]
David Baeckelandt suggests that the Leiden group was approached by Englishman Matthew Slade, son-in-law of Petrus Placius, a cartographer for the Dutch East India Company. Slade was also a spy for the English Ambassador. The Separatists' plans were therefore known both at court and among influential investors in the Virginia Company's Jamestown. [26] Negotiations were broken off with the Dutch at the encouragement of English merchant Thomas Weston , who assured them that he could resolve the London Company delays. [27] The London Company intended to claim the area explored by Hudson [26] before the Dutch could become fully established. The first Dutch settlers did not arrive in the area until 1624.
Weston did come with a substantial change, telling the Leiden group that parties in England had obtained a land grant north of the existing Virginia territory, to be called New England . This was only partially true; the new grant did come to pass, but not until late in 1620 when the Plymouth Council for New England received its charter. It was expected that this area could be fished profitably, and it was not under the control of the existing Virginia government. [27] [28]
A second change was known only to parties in England who chose not to inform the larger group. New investors had been brought into the venture who wanted the terms altered so that, at the end of the seven-year contract, half of the settled land and property would revert to the investors. Also, another provision was dropped which allowed each settler to have two days per week to work on personal business. [27]

Brewster's diversion
Amid these negotiations, William Brewster found himself involved with religious unrest emerging in Scotland . In 1618, King James had promulgated the Five Articles of Perth which were seen in Scotland as an attempt to encroach on their Presbyterian tradition. Pamphlets critical of this law were published by Brewster and smuggled into Scotland by April 1619. These pamphlets were traced back to Leiden, and a failed attempt to apprehend Brewster was made in July when his presence in England became known.
Also in July in Leiden, English ambassador Dudley Carleton became aware of the situation and began leaning on the Dutch government to extradite Brewster. An arrest was made in September, but only Thomas Brewer the financier was in custody. Brewster's whereabouts remain unknown between then and the colonists' departure. Brewster's type was seized. After several months of delay, Brewer was sent to England for questioning, where he stonewalled government officials until well into 1620. One resulting concession that England did obtain from the Netherlands was a restriction on the press, making such publications illegal to produce.
Thomas Brewer was ultimately convicted in England for his continued religious publication activities and sentenced in 1626 to a fourteen-year prison term. [29]

Preparations
Not all of the congregation were able to depart on the first trip. Many members were not able to settle their affairs within the time constraints, and the budget was limited for travel and supplies. It was decided that the initial settlement should be undertaken primarily by younger and stronger members. The remainder agreed to follow if and when they could.
Robinson would remain in Leiden with the larger portion of the congregation, and Brewster was to lead the American congregation. The church in America would be run independently, but it was agreed that membership would automatically be granted in either congregation to members who moved between the continents.
With personal and business matters agreed upon, supplies and a small ship were procured. Speedwell was to bring some passengers from the Netherlands to England, then on to America where it would be kept for the fishing business, with a crew hired for support services during the first year. The larger ship Mayflower was leased for transport and exploration services. [27] [30]

Voyage
The Speedwell was originally named Swiftsure. It was built in 1577 at sixty tons, and was part of the English fleet that defeated the Spanish Armada. It departed Delfshaven in July 1620 with the Leiden colonists, after a canal ride from Leyden of about seven hours. [31] It reached Southampton , Hampshire and met with the Mayflower and the additional colonists hired by the investors. With final arrangements made, the two vessels set out on August 5 ( Old Style )/August 15 (New Style). [30]
Soon thereafter, the Speedwell crew reported that their ship was taking in water, so both were diverted to Dartmouth, Devon . There it was inspected for leaks and sealed, but a second attempt to depart also failed, bringing them only as far as Plymouth , Devon . It was decided that Speedwell was untrustworthy, and it was sold; the ship's master and some of the crew transferred to the Mayflower for the trip. William Bradford observed that the Speedwell seemed "overmasted", thus putting a strain on the hull; and he attributed her leaking to crew members who had deliberately caused it, allowing them to abandon their year-long commitments. Passenger Robert Cushman wrote that the leaking was caused by a loose board. [32]

Atlantic crossing
Of the 120 combined passengers, 102 were chosen to travel on the Mayflower with the supplies consolidated. Of these, about half had come by way of Leiden, and about 28 of the adults were members of the congregation. [33] The reduced party finally sailed successfully on September 6 ( Old Style )/September 16 (New Style), 1620.
Initially the trip went smoothly, but under way they were met with strong winds and storms. One of these caused a main beam to crack, and the possibility was considered of turning back, even though they were more than halfway to their destination. However, they repaired the ship sufficiently to continue using a "great iron screw" brought along by the colonists (probably either a jack to be used for house construction or a cider press). [34] Passenger John Howland was washed overboard in the storm but caught a top-sail halyard trailing in the water and was pulled back on board.
One crew member and one passenger died before they reached land. A child was born at sea and named Oceanus . [35] [36]

Arrival in America
Land was sighted on November 9, 1620. The passengers had endured miserable conditions for about sixty-five days, and they were led by William Brewster in Psalm 100 as a prayer of thanksgiving. It was confirmed that the area was Cape Cod , within the New England territory recommended by Weston. An attempt was made to sail the ship around the cape towards the Hudson River , also within the New England grant area, but they encountered shoals and difficult currents around Cape Malabar (the old French name for present-day Monomoy ). It was decided to turn around, and by November 11/November 12 the ship was anchored in what is today known as Provincetown Harbor . [35] [37]

Mayflower Compact
The charter was incomplete for the Plymouth Council for New England when the colonists departed England (it was granted while they were in transit on November 3/November 13). [28] They arrived without a patent; the older Wincob patent was from their abandoned dealings with the London Company. Some of the passengers, aware of the situation, suggested that they were free to do as they chose upon landing, without a patent in place, and to ignore the contract with the investors. [38] [39]
A brief contract was drafted to address this issue, later known as the Mayflower Compact, promising cooperation among the settlers "for the general good of the Colony unto which we promise all due submission and obedience." It organized them into what was called a "civill body politick," in which issues would be decided by voting, the key ingredient of democracy . It was ratified by majority rule , with 41 adult male Pilgrims signing [40] for the 102 passengers (seventy-three males and twenty-nine females). Included in the company were nineteen male servants and three female servants, along with some sailors and craftsmen hired for short-term service to the colony. [41] At this time, John Carver was chosen as the colony's first governor. It was Carver who had chartered the Mayflower and his is the first signature on the Mayflower Compact, being the most respected and affluent member of the group. The Mayflower Compact was the seed of American democracy and has been called the world's first written constitution. [42] [43]

First landings
Thorough exploration of the area was delayed for over two weeks because the shallop or pinnace (a smaller sailing vessel) which they brought had been partially dismantled to fit aboard the Mayflower and was further damaged in transit. Small parties, however, waded to the beach to fetch firewood and attend to long-deferred personal hygiene.
Exploratory parties were undertaken while awaiting the shallop, led by Myles Standish (an English soldier whom the colonists had met while in Leiden) and Christopher Jones . They encountered an old European-built house and iron kettle, left behind by some ship's crew, and a few recently cultivated fields, showing corn stubble. [44]
An artificial mound was found near the dunes which they partially uncovered and found to be a Native grave. Further along, a similar mound was found, more recently made, and they stole provisions which had been placed in the graves, as the colonists feared that they might otherwise starve. Baskets of maize were found inside, some of which the colonists pilfered and placed into an iron kettle that they also found nearby, while they reburied the rest, intending to use the corn as seed for planting.
William Bradford later recorded in his book Of Plymouth Plantation that, after the shallop had been repaired,
By December, most of the passengers and crew had become ill, coughing violently. Many were also suffering from the effects of scurvy . There had already been ice and snowfall, hampering exploration efforts. During the first winter, half of them died. [ citation needed ]

First contact
Explorations resumed on December 6/December 16. The shallop party headed south along the cape, seven colonists from Leiden, three from London, and seven crew, and chose to land at the area inhabited by the Nauset people (roughly present-day Brewster , Chatham , Eastham , Harwich , and Orleans ), where they saw some native people on the shore who fled when the colonists approached. Inland they found more mounds, one containing acorns, which they exhumed and left, and more graves, which they decided not to dig.
Remaining ashore overnight, they heard cries near the encampment. The following morning, they were met by native people who proceeded to shoot at them with arrows. The colonists retrieved their firearms and shot back, then chased them into the woods but did not find them. There was no more contact with native people for several months. [45]
The local people were already familiar with the English, who had intermittently visited the area for fishing and trade before Mayflower arrived. In the Cape Cod area, relations were poor following a visit several years earlier by Thomas Hunt . Hunt kidnapped twenty people from Patuxet (the place that became New Plymouth) and another seven from Nausett, and he attempted to sell them as slaves in Europe. One of the Patuxet abductees was Squanto , who became an ally of the Plymouth colony.
The Pokanoket also lived nearby and had developed a particular dislike for the English after one group came in, captured numerous people, and shot them aboard their ship. By this time, there had already been reciprocal killings at Martha's Vineyard and Cape Cod. But during one of the captures by the English, Squanto escaped to England and there became a Christian. When he came back, he found that most of his tribe had died from plague. [39] [46]

Settlement
Continuing westward, the shallop's mast and rudder were broken by storms, and their sail was lost. They rowed for safety, encountering the harbor formed by the current Duxbury and Plymouth barrier beaches and stumbling on land in the darkness. They remained at this spot for two days to recuperate and repair equipment. It was named Clark's Island for a Mayflower mate who first set foot on that island. [47]
Resuming exploration on Monday, December 11/December 21, 1620, the party crossed over to the mainland and surveyed the area that ultimately became the settlement. The anniversary of this survey is observed in Massachusetts as Forefathers' Day and is traditionally associated with the Plymouth Rock landing tradition. This land was especially suited to winter building because it had already been cleared, and the tall hills provided a good defensive position.
The cleared village was known as Patuxet to the Wampanoag people, and was abandoned about three years earlier following a plague that killed all of its residents. The "Indian fever" involved hemorrhaging [48] and is assumed to have been fulminating smallpox introduced by European traders. The outbreak had been severe enough that the colonists discovered unburied skeletons in abandoned dwellings. [49] With the local population in such a weakened state, the colonists faced no resistance to settling there.
The exploratory party returned to the Mayflower , anchored twenty-five miles (40 km) away, [50] having been brought to the harbor on December 16/December 26. Only nearby sites were evaluated, with a hill in Plymouth (so named on earlier charts) [51] chosen on December 19/December 29.
Construction commenced immediately, with the first common house nearly completed by January 9/January 19, twenty feet square built for general use. [52] At this point, single men were ordered to join with one of the nineteen families, in order to eliminate the need to build any more houses than absolutely necessary. [52] Each extended family was assigned a plot one-half rod wide and three rods long for each household member, [52] then each family built their own dwelling. Supplies were brought ashore, and the settlement was mostly complete by early February. [45] [53]
When the first house was finished, it immediately became a hospital for the ill Pilgrims. Thirty-one of the company were dead by the end of February, with deaths still rising. Coles Hill, a prominence above the beach, became the first cemetery, with the graves allowed to overgrow with grass for fear that the Indians would discover how weakened the settlement had actually become. [54]
Between the landing and March, only 47 colonists had survived the diseases that they contracted on the ship. [54] During the worst of the sickness, only six or seven of the group were able to feed and care for the rest. In this time, half the Mayflower crew also died. [39]
William Bradford became governor in 1621 upon the death of John Carver . On March 22, 1621, the Pilgrims of Plymouth Colony signed a peace treaty with Massasoit of the Wampanoags . The patent of Plymouth Colony was surrendered by Bradford to the freemen in 1640, minus a small reserve of three tracts of land. Bradford served for eleven consecutive years, and was elected to various other terms until his death in 1657.
The colony contained roughly what is now Bristol County , Plymouth County , and Barnstable County, Massachusetts .
The Massachusetts Bay Colony was reorganized and issued a new charter as the Province of Massachusetts Bay in 1691, and Plymouth ended its history as a separate colony.

Etymology

Bradford's history
The first use of the word "pilgrims" for the Mayflower passengers appeared in William Bradford 's Of Plymouth Plantation . As he finished recounting his group's July 1620 departure from Leiden, he used the imagery of Hebrews 11:13–16 about Old Testament "strangers and pilgrims" who had the opportunity to return to their old country but instead longed for a better, heavenly country.
There is no record of the term Pilgrims being used to describe Plymouth's founders for 150 years after Bradford wrote this passage, except when quoting him. The Mayflower's story was retold by historians Nathaniel Morton (in 1669) and Cotton Mather (in 1702), and both paraphrased Bradford's passage and used his word pilgrims . At Plymouth's Forefathers' Day observance in 1793, Rev. Chandler Robbins recited this passage. [55]

Popular use
The name Pilgrims was probably not in popular use before about 1798, even though Plymouth celebrated Forefathers' Day several times between 1769 and 1798 and used a variety of terms to honor Plymouth's founders. Pilgrims was not mentioned, other than in Robbins' 1793 recitation. [56] The first documented use that was not simply quoting Bradford was at a December 22, 1798 celebration of Forefathers' Day in Boston . A song composed for the occasion used the word Pilgrims , and the participants drank a toast to "The Pilgrims of Leyden". [57] [58] The term was used prominently during Plymouth's next Forefather's Day celebration in 1800, and was used in Forefathers' Day observances thereafter. [59]
By the 1820s, the term Pilgrims was becoming more common. Daniel Webster repeatedly referred to "the Pilgrims" in his December 22, 1820 address for Plymouth's bicentennial, which was widely read. [60] Harriet Vaughan Cheney used it in her 1824 novel A Peep at the Pilgrims in Sixteen Thirty-Six , and the term also gained popularity with the 1825 publication of Felicia Hemans 's classic poem "The Landing of the Pilgrim Fathers". [61]

Flotilla
A flotilla (from Spanish , meaning a small flota ( fleet ) of ships, and this from French flotte ), or naval flotilla , is a formation of small warships that may be part of a larger fleet. A flotilla is usually composed of a homogeneous group of the same class of warship, such as frigates , destroyers , torpedo boats , submarines , gunboats , or minesweepers . Groups of larger warships are usually called squadrons , but similar units of non-capital ships may be called squadrons in some instances, and flotillas in others. Formations including more than one capital ships, e.g. men-of-war , battleships , and aircraft carriers , typically alongside smaller ships and support craft, are typically called fleets , each portion led by a capital ship being a squadron or task force (see reference below).
A flotilla is usually commanded by a rear admiral , a commodore or a captain , depending on the importance of the command (a vice admiral would normally command a squadron). A flotilla is often divided into two or more divisions , each of which might be commanded by the most senior commander , nearly always a lieutenant at the very least. A flotilla is often, but not necessarily, a permanent formation.
In modern navies, flotillas have tended to become administrative units containing several squadrons . [1] As warships have grown larger, the term squadron has gradually replaced the term flotilla for formations of destroyers, frigates and submarines in many navies.
A naval flotilla has no direct equivalent on land, but is, perhaps, the rough equivalent in tactical value of a brigade or regiment .

US Coast Guard
In the United States Coast Guard Auxiliary , a Flotilla is the basic organizational unit and consists of members at a local level where the majority of the work of the Auxiliary is done. A Flotilla is led by an elected Flotilla Commander assisted by an elected Vice Flotilla Commander, who is in turn assisted by appointed Flotilla Staff Officers. [2] A Coast Guard Auxiliary Division consists of multiple Flotillas and a District consists of multiple Divisions. Auxiliary Districts are organized along Coast Guard District lines and are administered by a Coast Guard officer (usually a Commander or Captain) who is called the Director of the Auxiliary.

Russian Navy
In the Russian Navy , the word flotilla has tended to be used for " brown-water " naval units - those operating not on the oceans and real seas, but on inland seas or rivers. Among the former are the present-day Caspian Flotilla , the early 20th century Satakundskaya Flotilla , or the Aral Flotilla of the 1850s; [3] among the latter, the Don Military Flotilla (which was created several times over more than 200 years), the Dnieper Flotilla (also extant in the 18th and 20th centuries), the Red Volga Flotilla , which participated in the Kazan Operation during the Russian Civil War , and the Danube Flotilla . In the 18th century, the term also applied to the comparatively small fleets operating on those seas where Russia did not have much naval presence yet, e.g. the Okhotsk Flotilla .

Non-military usage
The word flotilla has also been used at times to refer to a small fleet of vessels, commercial or otherwise. [4] There is also such thing as a flotilla holiday, in which is a group of chartered yachts that set sail together on the same route.

1991
1991 ( MCMXCI ) was a common year starting on Tuesday ( dominical letter F) of the Gregorian calendar , the 1991st year of the Common Era (CE) and Anno Domini (AD) designations, the 991st year of the 2nd millennium , the 91st year of the 20th century , and the 2nd year of the 1990s decade.
It was the year that is usually considered the final year of the Cold War that had begun in the late 1940s . During the year, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics collapsed into fifteen sovereign republics. India also abandoned its policies of socialism and autarky and began extensive neoliberal changes to its economy in July 1991 which would increase the GDP but also economic inequality over the next two decades. [1] A U.N. -authorized coalition force from thirty-four nations fought against Iraq , which had invaded Kuwait in the previous year, 1990 . The conflict would be called the Gulf War and would mark the beginning of a since-constant American military presence in the Middle East. The clash between Serbia and the other Yugoslav republics would lead into the beginning of the Yugoslav Wars , which ran through the rest of the decade.
The Japanese asset price bubble collapsed this year, leading to the Lost Years and a permanently stagnated (though still prosperous) Japanese economy. [2]

Sally Ride
Sally Kristen Ride (May 26, 1951 – July 23, 2012) was an American physicist and astronaut . Born in Los Angeles, she joined NASA in 1978 and became the first American woman in space in 1983. Ride was the third woman in space overall, after USSR cosmonauts Valentina Tereshkova (1963) and Svetlana Savitskaya (1982). Ride remains the youngest American astronaut to have traveled to space, having done so at the age of 32. [1] [2] After flying twice on the Orbiter Challenger , she left NASA in 1987. She worked for two years at Stanford University 's Center for International Security and Arms Control , then at the University of California, San Diego as a professor of physics, primarily researching nonlinear optics and Thomson scattering . She served on the committees that investigated the Challenger and Columbia space shuttle disasters, the only person to participate in both. [3] [4] Ride died of pancreatic cancer on July 23, 2012.

Early life
The elder child of Dale Burdell Ride and Carol Joyce (née Anderson), Ride was born in Los Angeles. She had one sibling, Karen "Bear" Ride, who is a Presbyterian minister. Both parents were elders in the Presbyterian Church. Ride's mother had worked as a volunteer counselor at a women's correctional facility. Her father had been a political science professor at Santa Monica College . [3]
Ride attended Portola Junior High (now Portola Middle School ) and then Birmingham High School before graduating from the private Westlake School for Girls in Los Angeles on a scholarship. [3] In addition to being interested in science, she was a nationally ranked tennis player. Ride attended Swarthmore College for three semesters, took physics courses at University of California, Los Angeles , and then entered Stanford University as a junior, graduating with a bachelor's degree in English and physics . At Stanford, she earned a master's degree in 1975 and a PhD in physics in 1978 while doing research on the interaction of X-rays with the interstellar medium. [5] Astrophysics and free electron lasers were her specific areas of study. [6]

NASA career
Ride was one of 8,000 people who answered an advertisement in the Stanford student newspaper seeking applicants for the space program . [7] She was chosen to join NASA in 1978. [8] During her career, Ride served as the ground-based capsule communicator (CapCom) for the second and third space shuttle flights ( STS-2 and STS-3 ) and helped develop the space shuttle's " Canadarm " robot arm. [8]
Prior to her first space flight, she was subject to media attention due to her gender. During a press conference, she was asked questions such as, "Will the flight affect your reproductive organs?" and "Do you weep when things go wrong on the job?" Despite this and the historical significance of the mission, Ride insisted that she saw herself in only one way—as an astronaut. [8] On June 18, 1983, she became the first American woman in space as a crew member on space shuttle Challenger for STS-7 . She was preceded by two Soviet women, Valentina Tereshkova in 1963 and Svetlana Savitskaya in 1982. The five-person crew of the STS-7 mission deployed two communications satellites and conducted pharmaceutical experiments. Ride was the first woman to use the robot arm in space and the first to use the arm to retrieve a satellite . [5]
Her second space flight was in 1984, also on board the Challenger . She spent a total of more than 343 hours in space. Ride had completed eight months of training for her third flight ( STS-61-M , a TDRS deployment mission) when the space shuttle Challenger disaster occurred. She was named to the Rogers Commission (the presidential commission investigating the accident) and headed its subcommittee on operations. Following the investigation, Ride was assigned to NASA headquarters in Washington, D.C., where she led NASA's first strategic planning effort, authored a report titled " NASA Leadership and America's Future in Space " and founded NASA's Office of Exploration. [5] After Sally Ride's death in 2012, General Donald Kutyna revealed that she had discreetly provided him with key information about O-rings (namely, that they become stiff at low temperatures) that eventually led to identification of the cause of the explosion. [9]

After NASA
In 1987, Ride left her position in Washington, D.C., to work at the Stanford University Center for International Security and Arms Control . In 1989, she became a professor of physics at the University of California, San Diego , and director of the California Space Institute. From the mid-1990s until her death, Ride led two public-outreach programs for NASA—the ISS EarthKAM and GRAIL MoonKAM projects, in cooperation with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and UCSD. The programs allowed middle school students to request images of the Earth [10] and moon. [11] In 1999, she acted in the season 5 finale of Touched by an Angel , titled "Godspeed". [ citation needed ] In 2003, she was asked to serve on the Columbia Accident Investigation Board . She was the president and CEO of Sally Ride Science , a company she co-founded in 2001 that creates entertaining science programs and publications for upper elementary and middle school students, with a particular focus on girls. [12] [13] [14]
According to Roger Boisjoly , the engineer who warned of the technical problems that led to the Challenger disaster, after the entire workforce of Morton-Thiokol shunned him Ride was the only public figure to show support for him when he went public with his pre-disaster warnings. Sally Ride hugged him publicly to show her support for his efforts. [15]
Ride wrote or co-wrote seven books [16] on space aimed at children, with the goal of encouraging children to study science. [17] [18]
Ride endorsed Barack Obama for U.S. President in 2008. [19] [20] She was a member of the Review of United States Human Space Flight Plans Committee , an independent review requested by the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) on May 7, 2009.

Personal life
Ride was extremely private about her personal life. In 1982, she married fellow NASA astronaut Steve Hawley . They divorced in 1987. [21]
After Ride's death, her obituary revealed that her partner of 27 years was Tam O'Shaughnessy , a professor emerita of school psychology at San Diego State University and childhood friend, who met her when both were aspiring tennis players. [22] [23] O'Shaughnessy was also a science writer and, later, the co-founder of Sally Ride Science. [24] [25] O'Shaughnessy now serves as the Chief Executive Officer and Chair of the Board of Sally Ride Science. [26] They wrote six acclaimed children's science books together. [16] Their relationship was revealed by the company and confirmed by her sister, who said she chose to keep her personal life private, including her sickness and treatments. [27] [28] She is the first known LGBT astronaut. [29] [30]

Death
Ride died on July 23, 2012, at the age of 61, in her home in La Jolla, California , [31] seventeen months after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer . [3] [32] [33] [34] Following cremation , her ashes were interred next to her father [35] at Woodlawn Memorial Cemetery, Santa Monica .

Awards and honors
Ride received numerous awards, including the National Space Society 's von Braun Award, the Lindbergh Eagle, and the NCAA's Theodore Roosevelt Award . She was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame and the Astronaut Hall of Fame and was awarded the NASA Space Flight Medal twice. She was the only person to serve on both of the panels investigating shuttle accidents (those for the Challenger accident and the Columbia disaster ). Two elementary schools in the United States are named after her: Sally Ride Elementary School in The Woodlands, Texas , and Sally Ride Elementary School in Germantown, Maryland . [5]
In 1994, Ride received the Samuel S. Beard Award for Greatest Public Service by an Individual 35 Years or Under, an award given out annually by Jefferson Awards . [36]
On December 6, 2006, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and First Lady Maria Shriver inducted Ride into the California Hall of Fame at the California Museum for History, Women, and the Arts . [37] The following year, she was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame in Dayton, Ohio .
Ride directed public outreach and educational programs for NASA's GRAIL mission, which sent twin satellites to map the moon’s gravity. On December 17, 2012, the two GRAIL probes, Ebb and Flow, were directed to complete their mission by crashing on an unnamed lunar mountain near the crater Goldschmidt . NASA announced that it was naming the landing site in honor of Sally Ride. [38] [39] Flying magazine ranked Ride at number 50 on their list of the "51 Heroes of Aviation" in 2013. [40]

Legacy
In April 2013, the U.S. Navy announced that a research ship would be named in honor of Ride. [41] This was done in 2014 with the christening of the oceanographic research vessel RV Sally Ride (AGOR-28) . [42]
In 2013, Janelle Monáe released a song called "Sally Ride". [43] Also in 2013, astronauts Chris Hadfield and Catherine Coleman performed a song called "Ride On". [44]
In 2013, the Space Foundation bestowed upon Ride its highest honor, the General James E. Hill Lifetime Space Achievement Award. [45]
On May 20, 2013, a "National Tribute to Sally Ride" was held at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C. On the same day, President Barack Obama announced that Ride would receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom , the highest civilian award in the United States. The medal was presented to her life partner Tam O'Shaughnessy in a ceremony at the White House on November 20, 2013. [46] [47]
In 2014, Ride was inducted into the Legacy Walk , an outdoor public display that celebrates LGBT history and people. [48] [49]
In 2017, a Google Doodle honoured her on International Women's Day. [50]

Record chart
A record chart also called a music chart is a ranking of recorded music according to popularity during a given period of time. Examples of music charts are the Hit parade , the Billboard Hot 100 or Top 40 .
Many different criteria are used in different charts, including sales of records , cassettes and compact discs , the amount of radio airplay, and since the introduction of digital technology, the number of downloads and the amount of streaming activity.
Some charts are specific to a particular musical genre and most to a particular geographical location (although download charts are not easily pinned down in this way). The most common period of time covered by a chart is one week with the chart being printed or broadcast at the end of this time. Summary charts for years and decades are then calculated from their component weekly charts. Component charts have become an increasingly important way to measure the commercial success of individual songs.

Chart hit
A chart hit is an extremely popular recording, identified by its inclusion in a chart that uses sales or other criteria to rank popular releases. Chart-topper and related terms (like number one , No. 1 hit , top of the charts , chart hit , and so forth) are widely used in common conversation and in marketing, and are loosely defined. In North America, the weekly charts from Billboard magazine are most often referenced (quite often internationally, as well), particularly the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart and Billboard 200 album chart, although there are many other charts and sources. Because of its value in promoting recording artists and releases, both directly to the consumer, and by encouraging exposure on radio, TV other media, chart positioning has long been a subject of scrutiny and controversy. Chart compilation methodology and data sources vary, ranging from "buzz charts" (based on opinions of various experts and tastemakers ), to charts that reflect empirical data such as retail sales. Therefore, a chart-topper may be anything from an "insiders' pick" to a runaway seller.
According to Joel Whitburn , Billboard introduced the Hot 100 on August 4, 1958. This was the first chart in the US to "fully integrate the hottest-selling and most-played pop singles." [1] From 1958 until 1991, Billboard compiled the chart from playlists reported by radio stations, and surveys of retail sales outlets. Before 1958, several charts were published, including "Best Sellers in Stores", "Most Played by Jockeys", and "Most Played in Juke Boxes", and, in later collations of chart hits, the record's highest placing in any of those charts was usually reported. On November 30, 1991, Billboard introduced a new method of determining the Hot 100, "by a combination of actual radio airplay monitored electronically by Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems (BDS), additional playlists from small-market stations, and actual point-of-sale information provided by Nielsen SoundScan." [1] Until 1998, any songs placed on the chart had to be physically available as a single . [1]

Other terminology
There are several commonly used terms when referring to a music/entertainment chart or the performance of a release thereon.
The term new entry is commonly used to denote a title which is making its début in that chart. This is applied to all charts, for instance a track which is outside the Top 40 but which later climbs into that level of the chart is considered to be a 'new entry' to the Top 40 that week. In most official charts, tracks have to have been on sale for a period of time in order to enter the charts; however, in some retailers' charts, new releases are included in charts as 'new entries' without a sales history in order to make them more visible to purchasers. A real new entry is a title that makes its chart début, no matter how many positions officially the chart actually is. In the UK the official published chart is a Top 100 although a new entry can take place between positions 101-200. The Top 40 is only used for radio to shorten the play-lists.
The term re-entry is used if a track which has previously entered a chart falls out of that chart and then later re-appears in it. This may come about if a release is reissued or if there is a surge of interest in the track. Generally any repeat entry of a track into a chart is considered a re-entry, unless the later version of the track is a materially different recording or significantly repackaged (such as Michael Jackson's "Thriller 25"), where the release would normally be considered separate and thus a "new" entry.
The term climber is used to refer to a release which is going higher in the chart week-on-week. Because chart positions are generally relative to each other on a week-to-week basis, a release does not necessarily have to increase sales week-to-week to be a climber, as if releases ahead of it decline in sales sufficiently they may slip below it. By the same metric, not all week-to-week sales increases result in a climber, if other releases improve by a sufficient amount to keep it from climbing. The term highest climber is used to denote the release making the biggest leap upwards in the chart that week. There is generally not an equivalent phrase for tracks going down the chart; the term "faller" is occasionally used, but not as widely as 'climber'.
The terms top 10 , top 20 and so forth are used to determine the relative success of a release. For instance, a track may be referred to as a 'top 10 hit' if it reaches a position between 1 and 10 on the singles chart, as a 'top 20 hit' if it reaches between positions 1 and 20, and so on. The most commonly known chart is the 'top 40' widely used by the media in various territories, though it is common for longer lists to be produced for or by the music industry. For example, in the UK, the Official Charts Company produces a top 200, although various media only publish shorter lists.
The term one-hit wonder is for an act that appears on the chart just once, although the term true one-hit wonder was the term given by Guinness Book of British Hit Singles & Albums (and also the Billboard book Top Pop Singles) is an act that has one number one hit and nothing else on the chart ever. If an act appears in some other form, (for example) a solo act that appears with a band or with other acts then these are taken separately.

Siouxsie and the Banshees
Siouxsie and the Banshees were an English rock band, formed in London in 1976 by vocalist Siouxsie Sioux and bass guitarist Steven Severin . Initially associated with the English punk rock scene, the band rapidly evolved to create "a form of post-punk discord full of daring rhythmic and sonic experimentation". [1] With the release of Juju in 1981, the group also became an important influence on the emerging gothic rock scene. [2] They disbanded in 1996, with Siouxsie and drummer Budgie continuing to record music as the Creatures , a second band they had formed in the early 1980s. In 2004, Siouxsie began a solo career.
The band released eleven full-length albums, thirty singles and seven compilation albums, many of which entered the Top 100 in the UK. Siouxsie and the Banshees' has placed highly in both musicians' polls and music papers' lists. The Times cited the group as "one of the most audacious and uncompromising musical adventurers of the post-punk era". [1] In 2006, Mojo rated guitarist John McGeoch in their list of "100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time" for his work on " Spellbound ". [3]

History

Formation (1976–77)
Siouxsie Sioux and Steven Severin met at a Roxy Music concert in September 1975, at a time when glam rock had faded and there was nothing new coming through with which they could identify. [4] From February 1976, Siouxsie, Severin and some friends began to follow an unsigned band, the Sex Pistols . [5] Journalist Caroline Coon dubbed them the " Bromley Contingent ", as most of them came from the Bromley region of South London , a label Severin came to despise. "There was no such thing, it was just a bunch of people drawn together by the way they felt and they looked". [5] They were all inspired by the Sex Pistols and their uncompromising attitude. [6] When they learned that one of the bands scheduled to play the 100 Club Punk Festival , organised by Sex Pistols manager Malcolm McLaren , were pulling out from the bill at the last minute, Siouxsie suggested that she and Severin play, even though they had no band name or additional members. [7] Two days later, the pair appeared at the festival held in London on 20 September 1976. With two borrowed musicians at their side, Marco Pirroni on guitar and John Simon Ritchie (already commonly known as Sid Vicious ) on drums, their set consisted of a 20-minute improvisation based on " The Lord's Prayer ". [8]
While the band intended to split up after the gig, they were asked to play again. Two months later, Siouxsie and Severin recruited drummer Kenny Morris and guitarist Peter Fenton. [9] After playing several gigs in early 1977, the band realised that Fenton did not fit in because he was "a real rock guitarist". John McKay finally took his place in July. [10]

The Scream
While the band sold out venues in London in early 1978, [11] they still had problems getting the right recording contract that could give them "complete artistic control". [12] Polydor finally offered this guarantee and signed them in June. Their first single, " Hong Kong Garden ", featuring a xylophone motif, reached the top 10 in the UK shortly after. A NME review hailed it as "a bright, vivid narrative, something like snapshots from the window of a speeding Japanese train, power charged by the most original, intoxicating guitar playing I heard in a long, long time". [13]
The band released their debut album, The Scream , in November 1978. Nick Kent of NME said of the record: "The band sounds like some unique hybrid of the Velvet Underground mated with much of the ingenuity of Tago Mago -era Can , if any parallel can be drawn". At the end of the article, he added this remark: "Certainly, the traditional three-piece sound has never been used in a more unorthodox fashion with such stunning results". [14]
The Banshees' second album, Join Hands , was released in 1979. In Melody Maker , Jon Savage described "Poppy Day" as "a short, powerful evocation of the Great War graveyards", [15] and Record Mirror described the whole record as a dangerous work that "should be heard". [16] The Banshees embarked on a major tour to promote the album. A few dates into the tour in September, Morris and McKay left an in-store signing after an argument and quit the band. [17] In need of replacements to fulfill tour dates, the Banshees' manager called drummer Budgie, formerly with the Slits , and asked him to audition. Budgie was hired, but Siouxsie and Severin had no success auditioning guitarists. [18] Robert Smith of the Cure offered his services in case they could not find a guitarist (his group were already the support band on the tour), so the band held him to it after seeing too many "rock virtuosos". [19] The tour resumed in September and after the last concert, Smith returned to the Cure. [20]

Kaleidoscope
Drummer Budgie became a permanent member and the band entered the studios to record the single " Happy House " with guitarist John McGeoch , formerly of Magazine . Their third album, Kaleidoscope , released in 1980, saw the Banshees exploring new musical territories with the use of other instruments like synthesizers, sitars and drum machines. The group initially had a concept of making each song sound completely different, without regard to whether or not the material could be performed in concert. [21] Melody Maker described the result as "a kaleidoscope of sound and imagery, new forms, and content, flashing before our eyes". [22] Kaleidoscope was a commercial success, peaking at number 5 in the UK album chart. This lineup, featuring McGeoch on guitar, toured the United States for the first time in support of the album, playing their first shows in New York City in November 1980. [23]
For Juju (1981), the band took a different approach and practised the songs in concert first before recording them. [24] Juju , according to Severin, became an unintentional concept album that "drew on darker elements". Sounds hailed it as "intriguing, intense, brooding and powerfully atmospheric". [25] The album later peaked at number 7 in the UK album charts and became one of their biggest sellers. [26] McGeoch's guitar contributions on Juju would be later praised by Johnny Marr of the Smiths . [27] [28]
During the 1981 accompanying tour, Siouxsie and Budgie secretly became a couple. [29] At the same time, they also began a drum-and-voice duo called the Creatures, releasing their first EP , Wild Things .
The Banshees followed in 1982 with A Kiss in the Dreamhouse . The record, featuring strings on several numbers, was an intentional contrast to their previous work, with Severin later describing it as a "sexy album". [30] The British press greeted it enthusiastically. [31] [32] Richard Cook finished his NME review with this sentence: "I promise...this music will take your breath away". [33] At that time, McGeoch was struggling with alcohol problems, and was hospitalised on his return to a promotional trip from Madrid . The band fired him shortly thereafter. [34] Severin asked Robert Smith to take over guitarist duties again; Smith accepted and rejoined the group in November 1982. [35]

Hyæna
During 1983, the band members worked on several side projects; Siouxsie and Budgie composed the first Creatures album, Feast , while Severin and Smith recorded as the Glove . Smith then insisted on documenting his time with the Banshees, so the group released a cover version of the Beatles ' " Dear Prudence " in September 1983. It became their biggest hit, reaching number 3 on the UK Singles Chart . [36] They also released a live album, Nocturne , and completed their sixth studio album, Hyæna . [37] Shortly before its release in May 1984, Smith left the group, citing health issues due to an overloaded schedule, being in two bands at once. [38]
Ex- Clock DVA guitarist John Valentine Carruthers replaced him. The Banshees then reworked four numbers from their repertoire, augmented by a string section, for their The Thorn EP. NME praised the project at its release: "The power of a classical orchestra is the perfect foil for the band's grindingly insistent sounds". [39] The new Banshees lineup spent much of 1985 working on a new record, Tinderbox . The group finished the song " Cities in Dust " before the album, so they rushed its release as a single prior to their longest tour of the UK. [40] Tinderbox was finally released in April 1986. Sounds magazine noted: " Tinderbox is a refreshing slant on the Banshees' disturbing perspective and restores their vivid shades to pop's pale palette". [41] Due to the length of time spent working on Tinderbox , the group desired spontaneity and decided to record an album of cover songs, Through the Looking Glass , in 1987. [42] Mojo magazine later praised their version of " Strange Fruit ". [43] [44] After the album's release, the band realised Carruthers was no longer fitting in and decided to work on new material as a trio. [45]

Peepshow
Following a lengthy break, the band recruited keyboard player Martin McCarrick and guitarist Jon Klein . The quintet recorded Peepshow in 1988, with non-traditional rock instrumentation including cello and accordion . Q magazine praised the album in its 5-star review: " Peepshow takes place in some distorted fairground of the mind where weird and wonderful shapes loom". [46] The first single, " Peek-a-Boo ", was seen by critics as a "brave move" with horns and dance elements. [47] Sounds wrote: "The snare gets slapped, Siouxsie's voice meanders all around your head and it all comes magically together". [47] "Peek-a-Boo" was their first real breakthrough in the United States. [48] After the tour, the band decided to take a break, with Siouxsie and Budgie recording as the Creatures and releasing their most critically acclaimed album to date, [49] Boomerang , and Severin and McCarrick working on material together. [50]

Superstition
In 1991, Siouxsie and the Banshees returned with the single " Kiss Them for Me ", mixing strings over a dance rhythm laced with exotica . The group collaborated with a yet-unknown Asian Tabla player Talvin Singh , who also sang during the bridge. The single received glowing reviews [51] and later peaked in the Billboard Hot 100 at number 23, allowing them to reach a new audience. [48] The album Superstition followed shortly afterwards and the group toured the US as second headliners of the inaugural Lollapalooza tour. The following year, the Banshees were asked to compose " Face to Face " as a single for the film Batman Returns . [52]
In 1993, the Banshees recorded new songs based on string arrangements, but quickly stopped the sessions to play festivals abroad. On their return home, they hired former Velvet Underground member John Cale to produce the rest of the record. [53] At its release, 1995's The Rapture was described by Melody Maker as "a fascinating, transcontinental journey through danger and exotica". [54] A few weeks after its release, Polydor dropped the band from its roster [55] and Klein was replaced on the band's last tour in 1995 by ex- Psychedelic Furs guitarist Knox Chandler . In April 1996, the band finally called it a day after 20 years of working together. [56] Siouxsie and Budgie announced that they would carry on recording as the Creatures. In 1999, they released the album Anima Animus to critical acclaim. [57]

2000s–present
In 2002, Universal Music kicked off the band's remastered back catalogue by releasing The Best of Siouxsie and the Banshees . In April, Siouxsie, Severin, Budgie and Chandler reunited briefly for the Seven Year Itch tour, which spawned the Seven Year Itch live album and DVD in 2003.
In 2004, Downside Up , a box set that collected all of the band's B-sides and The Thorn EP, was released. The Times wrote in its review: "for here is a group that never filled B-sides with inferior, throwaway tracks. Rather they saw them as an outlet for some of their most radical and challenging work". [58]
In 2006, the band's first four records were remastered and compiled with previously unreleased bonus tracks. Several recordings made for the John Peel radio show from 1978 to 1986 were also compiled on Voices on the Air: The Peel Sessions . AllMusic described the first session as "a fiery statement of intent" and qualified the other performances as "excellent". [59] The second batch of remasters, concerning the 1982–1986 era, was issued in April 2009. It included four other reissues (including their highly regarded A Kiss in the Dreamhouse from 1982). [31] [33] The At the BBC box set, containing a DVD with all of the band's UK live television performances and three CDs with in-concert recordings, was also released in June of the same year.
In April 2014, their debut single "Hong Kong Garden" was reissued on double 7" vinyl. It was announced that this would be part of a three-year plan with Universal. [60] In late October, their last four studio albums (1987's Through the Looking Glass , 1988's Peepshow , 1991's Superstition and 1995's The Rapture ) were reissued in remastered versions with bonus tracks. [61] Siouxsie and Severin curated a compilation CD called It's a Wonderfull Life for the monthly magazine Mojo , issued on 30 September with Siouxsie on the front cover. [62] On this CD, the pair honoured several composers of film music and classical music that had inspired them. [63]
In 2015, after releasing another compilation called Spellbound: The Collection , which included singles, album tracks and B-sides, the band reissued 1979's Join Hands on vinyl for Record Store Day , with different cover artwork. [64] A CD box set titled Classic Album Selection, Vol. 1 was released in January 2016, containing their first six albums newly remastered by Kevin Metcalfe. Classic Album Selection, Vol. 2 , including the other last six albums, followed in April. In November, a vinyl picture disc edition of The Scream was released. [65]

Musical style
Siouxsie and the Banshees have been described as developing "a form of post-punk discord full of daring rhythmic and sonic experimentation". [1] The Times wrote that "The Banshees stand proudly [... as] one of the most audacious and uncompromising musical adventurers of the post-punk era". [1] With some of their darkest material, the band also helped spawn the gothic rock scene. [2]

Legacy and influence
Siouxsie and the Banshees have inspired many musicians of different genres.
Joy Division 's Peter Hook , who saw the group in concert in Manchester in 1977, [66] said: "Siouxsie and the Banshees were one of our big influences [...] The Banshees first LP was one of my favourite ever records, the way the guitarist and the drummer played was a really unusual way of playing". [67] Joy Division producer Martin Hannett saw a difference between the Banshees' first main lineup and the other bands of 1977: "Any harmonies you got were stark, to say the least, except for the odd exception, like Siouxsie. They were interesting". [68] The Cure's leader, Robert Smith, declared in 2003: "Siouxsie and the Banshees and Wire were the two bands I really admired. They meant something." [69] He also pinpointed what the 1979 Join Hands tour brought him musically. "On stage that first night with the Banshees, I was blown away by how powerful I felt playing that kind of music. It was so different to what we were doing with the Cure. Before that, I'd wanted us to be like the Buzzcocks or Elvis Costello , the punk Beatles. Being a Banshee really changed my attitude to what I was doing". [70] The two songwriters of the Smiths cited the band. Singer Morrissey said that "Siouxsie and the Banshees were excellent", and that "they were one of the great groups of the late 70s, early 80s". [71] He also said in 1994, "If you study modern groups, those who gain press coverage and chart action, none of them are as good as Siouxsie and the Banshees at full pelt. That's not dusty nostalgia, that's fact". [72] Guitarist Johnny Marr, mentioned his liking for Banshees guitarist John McGeoch and his contribution to the single " Spellbound ". Marr qualified it as "clever" with a "really good picky thing going on which is very un-rock'n'roll". [73] U2 cited Siouxsie and the Banshees as a major influence [74] and selected "Christine" for a Mojo compilation. [75] The Edge was the presenter of an award given to Siouxsie at the Mojo ceremony in 2005. [76] [77] In December 1981, Dave Gahan of Depeche Mode named the Banshees as one of his three favourite bands along with Sparks and Roxy Music. [78] Gahan later hailed the single " Candyman " at its release, saying, "This is a great Banshees record[...], I like their sound". [79] Jim Reid of the Jesus and Mary Chain selected "Jigsaw Feeling" from The Scream as being among his favourite songs. [80] Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth cited "Hong Kong Garden" in his top 25 all-time favourite songs, [81] and Kevin Shields of My Bloody Valentine also mentioned them as being among his early influences. [82] Dave Navarro of Jane's Addiction once noted a parallel between his band and the Banshees: "There are so many similar threads: melody, use of sound, attitude, sex-appeal. I always saw Jane's Addiction as the masculine Siouxsie and the Banshees". [83] Primal Scream 's Bobby Gillespie liked the group's ability to produce pop songs while transmitting something subversive. He said, "They were outsiders bringing outsider subjects to the mainstream. We’re not trying to rip off the Banshees, but that's kind of where we’re coming from". [84]
The Banshees have been hailed by other acts. Radiohead cited McGeoch-era Siouxsie records when mentioning the recording of the song " There There ". [85] [86] Jeff Buckley , who took inspiration from several female vocalists, covered "Killing Time" (from the Boomerang album) on various occasions. [87] [88] Buckley also owned all the Banshees' albums in his record collection. [89] Suede singer Brett Anderson named Juju as one of his favourite records in 2011, [90] and also cited three other albums by the band on his website: The Scream , Kaleidoscope and Tinderbox . [91] Red Hot Chili Peppers performed " Christine " in concert, [92] and their guitarist John Frusciante cited the Banshees in interviews. [93] Garbage singer Shirley Manson stated, "I learned how to sing listening to The Scream and Kaleidoscope . Today, I can see and hear the Banshees' influence all over the place". [94] [95] Siouxsie has also been praised by other female singers including PJ Harvey [96] Courtney Love [97] and Ana Matronic of Scissor Sisters . [98] PJ Harvey has stated, "It's hard to beat Siouxsie Sioux, in terms of live performance. She is so exciting to watch, so full of energy and human raw quality", [99] and selected Siouxsie's album Anima Animus in her top 10 albums of 1999. [96] The band had a strong effect on two important trip hop acts. [100] [101] Tricky covered " Tattoo " to open his second album, Nearly God ; [102] the original 1983 proto-trip-hop version of that song aided Tricky in the creation of his style. [100] Massive Attack , sampled " Metal Postcard " on the song "Superpredators", recorded prior to their Mezzanine album. [103] Air 's Jean-Benoît Dunckel cited the group as one of his three main influences. [104] Billy Corgan of the Smashing Pumpkins cited the Banshees as an important influence on his music. [105]
The Banshees continue to influence younger musicians. Singer James Murphy was marked by certain Banshees albums during his childhood. [106] His band LCD Soundsystem covered " Slowdive " as a B-side to the single " Disco Infiltrator ". The Beta Band sampled "Painted Bird" on their track "Liquid Bird" from the Heroes to Zeros album. [107] TV on the Radio said that they have always tried to make a song that begins like "Kiss Them for Me" where all of a sudden, there's an "element of surprise" with "a giant drum coming in". [108] Electronica singer Santigold based one of her songs around the music of "Red Light". "'My Superman' is an interpolation of 'Red Light'", she explained. [109] Indie folk group DeVotchKa covered the ballad " The Last Beat of My Heart " at the suggestion of Arcade Fire singer Win Butler ; it was released on the Curse Your Little Heart EP. [110] Gossip named the Banshees as one of their major influences during the promotion of their single "Heavy Cross". [111] British indie band Bloc Party took inspiration from "Peek-a-Boo" and their singer Kele Okereke stated about that Banshees' single: "it sounded like nothing else on this planet. This is just a pop song that they put out in the middle of their career that nobody knows about, but to me it sounded like the most current but most futuristic bit of guitar-pop music I've heard". [112] The Weeknd sampled different parts of "Happy House" for his song "House of Balloons", and also used the chorus of the initial version. [113]

The B-52's
The B-52s (styled as The B-52's prior to 2008) [6] are an American new wave band, formed in Athens, Georgia , in 1976. Their best selling songs have been " Love Shack " and " Roam " while " Rock Lobster " remains a well-known hit. The original line-up consisted of Fred Schneider (vocals), Kate Pierson (vocals, keyboards), Cindy Wilson (vocals, percussion), Ricky Wilson (lead guitar), and Keith Strickland (drums, rhythm guitar, keyboards). After Ricky Wilson's death from AIDS in 1985, Strickland switched from drums to lead guitar. The band also added touring members for albums and live performances.
Rooted in new wave and 1960s rock and roll , the group later straddled many genres , ranging from post-punk to pop rock . [ citation needed ] The "guy vs. gals" vocals of Schneider, Pierson, and Wilson, sometimes used in call and response style, and their unique guitar and keyboard driven instrumentation, are their trademark sound.

History

1976–1979: Formation and early years
The B-52's were formed in 1976 when vocalist Cindy Wilson , her older brother and guitarist Ricky , keyboardist and vocalist Kate Pierson , original drummer and percussionist Keith Strickland and cowbell player, poet and lead vocalist Fred Schneider held an impromptu jam session after sharing a tropical Flaming volcano drink at a Chinese restaurant in Athens, Georgia. Other ideas they had to name their band were the "Tina-Trons" and " Fellini's Children." When they first jammed, Strickland played guitar and Ricky Wilson played congas. They later played their first concert (with Wilson playing guitar) in 1977 at a Valentine's Day party for their friends. [7] [8] [9]
The band's name comes from a particular beehive hairdo resembling the nose cone of the aircraft of the same name. [10] Strickland suggested the name after a dream he had had one night, of a band performing in a hotel lounge. In the dream he heard someone whisper in his ear that the name of the band was "the B-52s." The band's quirky take on the new wave sound of their era was a combination of dance and surf music set apart from their contemporaries by the unusual guitar tunings used by Ricky Wilson [9] and thrift-store chic .
Their first single, " Rock Lobster ," recorded for DB Records in 1978, was an underground success, [7] selling over 2,000 copies in total, [9] that led to the B-52's performing at CBGB and Max's Kansas City [9] in New York City. Both this version of "Rock Lobster" and its B-side "52 Girls" are different recordings from those on their first album, and the early version of "52 Girls" is in a different key.
The re-recorded version of "Rock Lobster" was released as a single. In the UK and Germany it was backed with an instrumental version of "Running Around," a non-album track. (A vocal re-recording of this would appear on their second album, Wild Planet .) The buzz created by the record in the UK meant their first show in London at the Electric Ballroom , London, was packed in anticipation, with many UK pop stars such as Sandie Shaw , Green Gartside from Scritti Politti , Joe Jackson , and others in attendance. In Canada, released on the Warner Bros. label , the single went from cult hit to bona fide smash, eventually going on to reach the No. 1 position in the RPM -compiled national chart on May 24, 1980. [11]

1979–1982: 
In 1979, the B-52's signed contracts with Warner Bros. Records for North America, South America, Australia, and New Zealand, and with Island Records for the UK, Europe, and Asia. In April, they flew over to Compass Point Studios in Nassau , Bahamas to record their debut studio album , with Island founder Chris Blackwell producing. [9] The band was surprised by Blackwell's recording methods; he wanted to keep the sound as close as possible to their actual live sound so used almost no overdubs or additional effects. [12]
Released on July 6, 1979, The B-52's contained re-recorded versions of "Rock Lobster" and "52 Girls", six originals recorded solely for the album, and a cover of the Petula Clark single " Downtown ". The album was a major success, especially in Australia where it reached number three on the charts alongside its three singles " Planet Claire ," "Rock Lobster," and "Dance This Mess Around." In the United States, the single "Rock Lobster" reached the Billboard Hot 100 chart, while the album itself was certified platinum by the RIAA . In 1980, John Lennon cited "Rock Lobster" as an inspiration for his comeback with Double Fantasy . [13]
In April 1980, as with their first album, The B-52's traveled to Compass Point Studios in the Bahamas to record the follow-up. Several of the songs from the album had been concert staples since 1978; the band consciously did not record them for their first album because they had too many tracks and wanted a strong second album, knowing that performing the tracks live would make fans look forward to it. Rhett Davies co-produced the album, with more emphasis put on slick production; the album has a slightly more psychedelic and even paranoid sound than that of their debut.
Released on August 27, 1980, Wild Planet was well received by critics, most of whom regarded it as a strong second album following the success of their first; many fans consider it their best album. The album reached number eighteen on the Billboard 200 chart in 1980 [14] and was certified gold; " Private Idaho " became their second Hot 100 entry. On January 26, 1980, The B-52's performed on Saturday Night Live ; they also performed at the Heatwave festival (billed as the "New Wave Woodstock") in Toronto, Canada in August 1980, and appeared in the Paul Simon film One Trick Pony . In July 1981, Party Mix! was released, a six-song collection containing songs from their first two albums remixed and sequenced to form two long tracks, one on each side.
In 1981, the band collaborated with Talking Heads' David Byrne to produce a third full-length studio album . Due to alleged conflicts with Byrne over the album's musical direction, recording sessions for the album were aborted, prompting the band to release Mesopotamia in 1982 as an EP . [15] In 1991, Party Mix! and Mesopotamia , the latter of which had been remixed, were combined and released together on a single compact disc . It was also in 1982 that the band appeared at the inaugural Us Festival . They performed on the first day of the festival alongside Talking Heads, Oingo Boingo , and The Police .

1982–1988: 
In December 1982, the band began recording their fourth album, Whammy! . According to Pierson, Strickland no longer wanted to play the drums, so the band switched to drum machines for this album, with Strickland and Ricky Wilson playing all the music on that album, and the rest of the band providing vocals only. Having originally played guitars, organ, bass guitar and synthesizers, Pierson switched to a mainly vocal role in the studio, but remained behind the keyboards on tour. The band also began experimenting heavily with the synthesizers during this period.
Released on April 27, 1983, Whammy! reached number 29 on the Billboard 200 chart. [16] " Legal Tender " reached the Billboard Hot 100 chart, as well as the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play Singles chart alongside " Whammy Kiss " and " Song for a Future Generation ". [16] For the Whammy! tour, some tracks featured Strickland on the drums while others used a backing track so that Strickland could come forward and play other parts. This also freed up the vocalists (now sometimes not playing instruments) to perform some simple choreography. Copyright issues with Yoko Ono led to the cover song "Don't Worry" [17] being replaced by "Moon 83" — a rearranged version of "There's a Moon in the Sky (Called the Moon)" from their debut album — on future pressings of Whammy! . [16]
In January 1985, the band performed in Brazil at Rock in Rio , their largest crowd ever. Having taken a one-year break, the band struggled to write new material for their next album. They all lived together in the same house, and felt that collaboration was not working. They decided to try to write songs separately, and began recording in July 1985, again using drum machines and extensive synthesizers. During the recording, guitarist Wilson had been suffering from AIDS , [18] though none of the other band members were aware of his illness except for Strickland, as he "did not want anyone to worry about him or fuss about him." [19] On October 12, 1985, Wilson died from his illness, at the age of 32. [18]
When the band returned to the studio, Strickland had learned how to play the guitar in Wilson’s unique style and switched permanently to the new instrument, leaving session players to complete the rhythm section. [20] The results were released on September 8, 1986 as Bouncing off the Satellites , a mixture of solo efforts and group efforts. Because of Wilson's death, the band did not tour to promote the album. A music video was made for " Girl from Ipanema Goes to Greenland " and the band appeared on some UK television programs but then took a two-year hiatus.
Cindy Wilson was devastated by her brother's death, and her bandmates were depressed about Ricky's passing. The band went into seclusion and did not tour to promote their album. This was the beginning of an extended hiatus from their musical careers. [1] In 1987, they released a public service announcement in the style of The Beatles ' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album cover on behalf of amfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research . [21]

1988–1992: Reformation, 
Strickland had been composing in 1988. After he played some of his new music for the other band members, they all agreed to try writing together again, with Pierson, Wilson and Schneider contributing the lyrics and melodies. In 1989 the band released Cosmic Thing , their mainstream breakthrough, released on Reprise Records worldwide. The single " Channel Z " from the new album became an alternative and college radio hit, hitting number one on the U.S. Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart, [22] receiving significant airplay on MTV 's modern rock show 120 Minutes .
The next single, " Love Shack ", with its party vibe and colorful music video , [7] became their first top 40 hit on the Billboard Hot 100, ultimately reaching No. 3 in November 1989. [23] That peak was matched in March 1990 when their follow-up single, " Roam ", also reached No. 3. [24] In Australia, the country that had most embraced the band a decade earlier, "Love Shack" stayed at number one for eight weeks.
A fourth single, " Deadbeat Club ", which reminisced about the band's early days in Athens and whose video was shot on location and featured a cameo by fellow Athens artist R.E.M. 's Michael Stipe , reached No. 30. Cosmic Thing climbed into the U.S. top five and earned multi-platinum certification. [25] it also had huge international success reaching No. 1 in both Australia and New Zealand and No. 8 in the UK. The group had a hugely successful world tour to support the record, and appeared on the cover of Rolling Stone in March 1990. [26] In 1990 the B-52's were nominated for four MTV Video Music Awards including Video of the Year. They won two awards, Best Group Video and Best Art Direction.
Pierson sang on Iggy Pop 's song " Candy ", which gave him a top 40 hit. In 1991 Schneider's solo record was repackaged and re-released, resulting in his first Hot 100 single when " Monster " climbed to No. 85, and Pierson again guest-starred on a popular track, R.E.M.'s " Shiny Happy People ", which reached No. 10 in September 1991. Pierson also appeared on two other songs from R.E.M.'s chart-topping album Out of Time , "Near Wild Heaven", and "Me in Honey", as well as the outtake "Fretless".
In late 1990 Cindy Wilson took time off from the band, with Julee Cruise filling in for her on tour. The B-52's released Good Stuff in 1992 as a trio – the only release on which Cindy Wilson was not present – and the title track reached No. 28 in August of that year. The album made it to No. 18 in the U.S. It is also the group's most overtly political album, though they had been activists and fundraisers for environmental, AIDS and animal rights causes for many years. [27]

1992–2007: Hiatus from studio material
The band had their next chart entry in 1994 when, as The BC-52's , they appeared in The Flintstones live-action movie and sang the title song. When released as a single, it reached No. 33 in the U.S. and No. 3 in the UK. In 1994, Pierson and Schneider also sang on the theme song for the Nickelodeon series Rocko's Modern Life from the second season on. In the 1990s, former Duran Duran drummer Sterling Campbell joined the band, but left in 2000 to tour with David Bowie and was replaced that year by Zachary Alford, who had recorded and toured with the band during the Cosmic Thing era. Pierson and Cindy Wilson recorded the song "Ain't no Stopping us Now" for the 1996 film The Associate starring Whoopi Goldberg. Wilson rejoined the B-52's the same year.
A career retrospective, Time Capsule: Songs for a Future Generation , appeared in 1998 along with two remixed maxi-singles "Summer of Love '98" and "Hallucinating Pluto". A major tour (with co-headliners the Pretenders ) to promote the collection took place. "Debbie", another single from the album (a tribute to Blondie's Debbie Harry ), placed 35 on Billboard 's Hot Modern Rock Tracks. [28] In 1999 they recorded a parody of "Love Shack" called "Glove Slap" for an episode of The Simpsons . They co-headlined another major tour in 2000 with the Go-Go's . In 2000, the band recorded the song "The Chosen One" for the movie Pokémon: The Movie 2000 . [29]
A more extensive anthology, Nude on the Moon: The B-52's Anthology , appeared in 2002. In February of that year, the band held a series of concerts celebrating their 25th anniversary. The Irving Plaza show in New York City had Tina Weymouth and Chris Frantz of the Talking Heads and Yoko Ono as guests with Chicks on Speed as the opener. [30] The B-52's recorded the song "Orange You Glad It's Summer" for a Target commercial that aired in spring/summer 2002. Target also used the song "Junebug" in a TV spot five years later.
In late 2004, the band opened for Cher on a few dates of her Farewell Tour. In March 2006, they opened for The Rolling Stones at a benefit for the Robin Hood Foundation. They had three remix EPs released by Planet Clique: Whammy! in 2005, Mesopotamia in 2006, and Wild Planet in 2007. During this time span, they appeared on many television shows including The L Word , V.I.P. , The Rosie O'Donnell Show , The Tonight Show with Jay Leno , the Late Show with David Letterman , The Arsenio Hall Show , Saturday Night Live , Live with Regis and Kelly , The Today Show , Good Morning America and numerous times on VH1 .

2008–present: 
In 2008 the band dropped the apostrophe from their name to become "The B-52s". [6] Funplex , the band's first original album in 16 years (since 1992's Good Stuff ), was released on March 25, 2008 by Astralwerks . [31] [32] [33] Talking about the record's sound, Strickland noted, "It's loud, sexy rock and roll with the beat turned up to hot pink." [34] The album is produced by Steve Osborne , who was asked to work on the album based on his work with New Order on the album Get Ready .
The album debuted at No. 11 on the Billboard charts in the U.S., immediately making it the second-highest charting B-52s album ever. The band toured in support of the album as well as making appearances on talk shows, including The Tonight Show , The Ellen DeGeneres Show , and performing on The Today Show on Memorial Day 2008. They also participated in the True Colors Tour 2008 with Cyndi Lauper and embarked on a European tour in July.
The first single from the album was " Funplex ", which was released digitally on January 29 to the iTunes Store in the U.S. The second single lifted from the album was " Juliet of the Spirits ". [35] Schneider said in an interview that the album just broke even and could be the B-52s' last new studio album, though he later retracted that statement. [36] The B-52s performed their hit track " Love Shack " with Sugarland at the 2009 CMT Music Awards .
On February 18, 2011, the B-52s played a show at the Classic Center in their hometown of Athens, Georgia , four days after the 34th anniversary of their first-ever show on February 14, 1977. The concert was filmed and recorded for With the Wild Crowd! Live in Athens, GA , released in October 2011. The DVD and Blu-ray were released on March 20, 2012.
In the next few years, the B-52s continued to play 50–60 live shows a year, including the closing show for the 2011 edition of the Montreal Jazz Festival , the setlist ranging from tracks on Funplex to their greatest hits and songs never played live before (such as Bouncing off the Satellites ' "Wig"). The touring band includes musicians Sterling Campbell (drums), Paul Gordon (keyboards, guitar) and Tracy Wormworth (bass).
On April 29, 2012 the group performed as the house band during the 2012 TV Land Awards , playing "Love Shack," "Roam" and "Rock Lobster," along with many of their other hits.
On December 13, 2012, Strickland announced he would no longer tour with the B-52s, though he would continue as a member of the band. "It is the path I know in my heart I must follow. I will continue to be in the B-52s ... I will just not tour. My barnstorming days have come to an end, but I wholeheartedly support Cindy, Fred and Kate's decision to continue." [37]
In March 2013 the band announced it would be co-headlining a summer tour with The Go-Go's . [38] They also planned a European tour to start in August of the same year. [39] In 2013, Pierson began recording her first solo album, Guitars and Microphones , which was released in February 2015.
In the summer of 2015, the band toured with Tears for Fears , The English Beat and The Psychedelic Furs .
In early 2017, the band continued performing, including touring Australia and New Zealand with Simple Minds in February. [40] [41] That same month, they appeared as special guests in the sketch comedy show Portlandia . [42]
In 2017, The B-52s were on RuPaul's Drag Race Season 9, on the second episode. And the lipsync song was Love Shack.

In 1890–1927 there were only 12 wells in Surakarta. Today, underground water wells in 23 locations produce about 45 l/second. [4]
In March 2006, Surakarta's state water company (PDAM) had a production capacity of 865.02 l/second: from Cokrotulung , Klaten , 27 km from Solo, 387 l/s; and from 26 deep wells, with a total capacity of 478,02 l/second. The total reservoir capacity is 9,140 m 3 and can serve 55,22% of the population. [5]

Climate
Under the Köppen climate classification , Surakarta features a tropical monsoon climate . The city has a lengthy wet season spanning from October through June, and a relatively short dry season covering the remaining three months (July through September). On average Surakarta receives just under 2200 mm of rainfall annually, with its wettest months being December, January, and February. As is common in areas featuring a tropical monsoon climate, temperatures are relatively consistent throughout the year. Surakarta's average temperature is roughly 30 degrees Celsius every month.

Administrative division
Surakarta City and its surrounding regencies, Karanganyar , Sragen , Wonogiri , Sukoharjo , Klaten , and Boyolali , are collectively called the ex- Surakarta Residency (Dutch: Residentie Soerakarta ). After Surakarta became a city, it was divided into five districts ( kecamatan ), each led by a camat , and subdivided into 51 kelurahan , each led by a lurah . The districts of Surakarta are: [7]

Greater Surakarta
Surakarta as a dense core city in Central Java, and its second city, spills considerably into neighboring regencies. Though a traffic study quotes the population as 1,158,000 as of 2008, [8] this reflects only the very core, as the city affects entire neighboring regencies by significantly driving up overall population densities in Sukoharjo Regency and Klaten Regency over the already dense countryside. Furthermore, the government of Indonesia officially defines a broader region as Surakarta's extended metropolitan zone, with the acronym Subosukawonosraten as the city and 6 surrounding regencies., [9] [10] though obviously not a core metropolitan area as some of its regencies are not particularly suburbanized, it reflects a broader planning region. Both the metropolitan area and extended areas border Yogyakarta's metropolitan area, while only the extended metropolitan area borders Kedungsapur or Greater Semarang .

Demography
One of the earliest censuses held in Surakarta Residency ( Residentie Soerakarta ) was in 1885. At that time, with an area of about 5,677 km², there were 1,053,985 people in Surakarta Residency, including 2,694 Europeans and 7,543 Indonesian-Chinese. The area, 130 times the current area of Surakarta, had a population density of 186 people/km². The capital of the residency itself (roughly the size of the City of Solo proper) in 1880 had 124,041 people living in it. [11]
According to the 2009 census, there were 245,043 males and 283,159 females (a sex ratio of 86.54) in Surakarta. [12] 119,951 of the population were 14 years or younger, 376,180 were between 15 and 64, and 32,071 were above 65. [13] The number of households was 142,627 and the average number of household members was 3.7. [14] The population growth in the last 10 years was about 0.565% per year. [15]
The labor force of Solo in 2009 was 275,546, of whom 246,768 were working, while 28,778 were seeking work. Another 148,254 people aged 15 and above were not in the labor force. [16] Based on employment numbers, the most common work in Solo was worker/paid employee (112,336), followed by self-employee (56,112), self-employee assisted by temporary employee (32,769), unpaid employee (20,193), self-employee assisted by permanent employee (14,880), freelance employee in non-agricultural work (10,241), and freelance employee in agricultural work (237). [17] Based on the industry, most people in Solo worked in trade (106,426), services (59,780), manufacturing (42,065), communication (16,815), construction (9,217), financing (9,157), or agriculture (2,608), and the rest in mining, electricity, gas, and water companies (700). [18]
The mean working week in Solo was 47.04 hours (47.74 for men and 46.13 for women), [19] and 212,262 people worked more than 35 hours per week compared to 34,506 who worked less than that. [20]

Education
According to 2009 statistics, 242,070 people above 15 in the city had finished high school, while 86,890 had only finished junior high school, and 94,840 were still in school or had only finished elementary school. The percentage of high-school graduates was the highest of the cities and regencies in Central Java. [21]
According to the statistics of Data Pokok Pendidikan (Dapodik), in the 2010/2011 school year, there were 68,153 students and 853 schools in Surakarta. [22] There are two big universities possessing more than 20.000 students: Sebelas Maret University (UNS) and Muhammadiyah University of Surakarta (UMS), both are recognised as among Indonesia's 50 best universities according to the Directorate of Higher Education, Ministry of Education RI. There is also arts concentrated university Art Institute of Surakarta (ISI), religious studies State Islamic Institute ( IAIN Surakarta ). There are around 52 private universities and colleges such as STIKES Muhammadiyah, Universitas Tunas Pembangunan, Universitas Slamet Riyadi, Universitas Surakarta, Universitas Setia Budi etc. [23]

Economy
The Domestic brutto Income of Surakarta in 2009 was 16,813,058.62 IDR, the fourth highest in Central Java after Kudus, Cilacap, and Semarang. [24] The living standard in 2009 was 723,000 IDR. [25] The Consumer price index in January 2011 was 119.44. [26]

Sports
Surakarta has a long sport history and tradition. In 1923 Solo already had a football club , one of the earliest clubs in Indonesia (at that time still the Dutch Indies), called Persis Solo . Persis Solo was a giant club in the Dutch Indies and still exists, but is past its heyday. During the Perserikatan tournament, Persis became seven-time champion. Currently it plays in the Premier Division . Other than Persis, several clubs have existed in Solo: Arseto , Pelita Solo , Persijatim Solo FC , and lastly Solo FC , that plays in the Indonesian Premier League since 2011. Both clubs that still exist, Persis and Solo FC, have made Manahan Stadium their home ground. Manahan Stadium is one of the best sport stadiums in Central Java, with more than 25,000 seats, and has several times hosted national and international matches. It was recently the venue for the AFC Champions Cup 2007 , the final venue of the Indonesian Cup 2010, and the opening venue for the Indonesian Premiere League on January 15, 2011. [27]

Transportation

Air
Adisumarmo International Airport ( IATA code: SOC ) has direct flights to Kuala Lumpur by AirAsia and during the haji season, Saudi Arabia , as well as regular flights to Jakarta by Garuda Indonesia , Sriwijaya Air , Lion Air and Citilink . The airport is located 14 km north of the city. [28] Since May 2011, BST (Batik Solo Trans) buses connect the airport to the city. There is also taxicab service. In 2009 Adisumarmo had 2,060 outbound domestic flights and 616 outbound international flights. [29]

Train
Surakarta has four train stations, Solo Balapan , Purwosari , Solo Jebres , and Solo Kota (Sangkrah). Solo Balapan is the largest station in Surakarta, and is the junction between Yogyakarta (westward), Semarang (northward), and Surabaya (eastward), while Purwosari is the junction located west of Solo Balapan, and has a connection to Wonogiri (southward). There are several direct lines to other cities, such as Jakarta, Bandung, Surabaya, Semarang, Madiun, and Malang. For regional traffic, a special train connects Surakarta and Yogyakarta, the Prameks ( Prambanan Ekspres ) train.
In July 26, 2011 the Railbus has been launched to serve Surakarta/Solo– Wonogiri route, but for the moment only Solo- Sukoharjo trackage was ready due to there are 99 bridges should be strengthen between Sukoharjo-Wonogiri. [30] Until April 2012, Surakarta-Wonogiri railbus is still in a big question mark due to the 12 tons railbuses are considered too heavy for existing railroad track that only has the capacity of accommodating 10-ton vehicles, furthermore PT KAI have proposed a fare between Rp30,000 ($3.27) and Rp40,000 ($4.36) per passenger, while Surakarta administration wants tickets to be priced much lower between Rp5,000 ($0.54) and Rp7,000 ($0,76). [31]

Road
Tirtonadi Terminal is the largest bus terminal in Surakarta. Surakarta is situated on Indonesian National Route 15 , which connects it to Yogyakarta and Waru ( Sidoarjo ). A Semarang–Solo Toll Road is currently under construction. In 2009 the total extent of roadways in the city was 705.34 km: 13.15 km state road, 16.33 km province road, and 675.86 km local road. [32] The number of bus companies was 23, and the total number of buses operating was 1,115 intra-provincial buses and 1,107 inter-provincial. [33]
In 2010, the government of Surakarta launched a new bus route named Batik Solo Trans (BST), which resembles TransJakarta bus rapid transit service. It has only two routes, the Departure Route (Adisumarmo Airport–Kartasura–Palur) and the Return Route (Palur–Kartasura–Adisumarmo Airport). A single trip costs Rp.3000, Rp.1500 for students. A special ticket for the trip from or to the airport costs Rp.7000. [34]

Tourism
One main tourist attraction of Surakarta is the Keraton Surakarta , the palace of Susuhunan Pakubuwono, also the Princely Javanese court of Mangkunegaran . Pasar Gede market is often visited by tourists, mostly for its unique architecture and fame as the biggest traditional market in the Solo area. The Pasar Klewer is famous for its batiks in all prices and qualities, while the Pasar Triwindhu located near Mangkunegaran palace specialises in antiques. Taman Sriwedari is a popular local entertainment park featuring a children's playground, dangdut music performance and Wayang Wong traditional Javanese dance performance almost every night. Near the park is Radyapustaka Museum, one of the oldest museums in Indonesia, with a collection of Javanese cultural artefacts. The traditional batik village of Laweyan and Kampung Batik Kauman, located in the southwest part of the city and the city centre respectively, are famous for producing fine quality Javanese batik.
Within Surakarta tourists can also use the Jaladara old steam train which was launched on in September 2009 for 5.6 km connecting Purwosari Station and City (Sangkrah) Station. In 2011 there were 60 trips and in 2012 will be 80 trips. [35]

Wikipedia logo
The logo of Wikipedia , an Internet -based free multilingual encyclopedia , is an unfinished globe constructed from jigsaw pieces—some pieces are missing at the top—inscribed with glyphs from many different writing systems . As displayed on the web pages of the English-language version of Wikipedia, there is a wordmark "Wikipedia" under the globe, and below that the text "The Free Encyclopedia" in the free open-source Linux Libertine font. [1] [2]

Design
Each piece bears a glyph (a letter or other character ), or glyphs, symbolizing the multilingualism of Wikipedia. As with the Latin letter “W”, these glyphs are in most cases the first glyph or glyphs of the name “Wikipedia” rendered in that language. They are as follows: [3]
The empty space at the top represents the incomplete nature of the project, the articles and languages yet to be added. [ citation needed ]

History
An initial design of the logo was created by Paul Stansifer, a then 17-year-old Wikipedia user, whose entry won a design competition run by the site in 2003. Another Wikipedia user, David Friedland, subsequently improved the logo by changing the styling of the jigsaw pieces so that their boundaries seemed indented and simplified their contents to be a single glyph per piece, rather than a jumble of nonsense multilingual text. [5] In the process, some errors were introduced. [5] In particular, one piece of Devanagari script and one piece of Japanese katakana were incorrectly rendered. [6]

Current logo
In 2007, a modified 3D model was developed by Wikimedia Taiwan for Wikimania , when they distributed a 3-inch diameter spherical puzzle based on the logo, that attendees could piece together. It did not add other letters on the parts that cannot be seen on the 2D logo, but used that space to include small logos of the sister projects and information about Wikimania. A variant of that model was used to build a person-sized Wikiball that spun on a stand, featured during the event. [7] This led to a renewed interest in getting a proper 3D model for the logo.
By 2007, users on listservs discovered that the logo had some minor errors. The errors were not immediately fixed, because, according to Friedland, he could not locate the original project file. Friedland added that "I have tried to reconstruct it, but it never looks right" and that the logo "should be redrawn by a professional illustrator." [5] Kizu Naoko ( 木津 尚子 ? ) , a Wikipedian, said that most Japanese users supported correcting the errors. In an e-mail to Noam Cohen of The New York Times , Kizu said that "It could be an option to leave them as they are. Most people don't take it serious [ sic ] and think the graphical logo is a sort of pot-au-feu of various letters without meaning." [5]
In late 2009, the Wikimedia Foundation undertook to fix the errors and generally update the puzzle globe logo. Among other concerns, the original logo did not scale well and some letters appeared distorted. [8] For the new logo, the Wikimedia Foundation defined which characters appear on the "hidden" puzzle pieces, and had a three-dimensional computer model of the globe created to allow the generation of other views. [9] A partial 3D globe was commissioned for the Wikimedia office. [10]
The new logo was rolled out on the projects in May 2010. It features the new 3D rendering of the puzzle globe, with corrected characters (and the Klingon character replaced by a Ge'ez character). The wordmark has been modified from the Hoefler Text font to the open-source Linux Libertine font, and the subtitle is no longer italicized. The "W" character, which was used in various other places in Wikipedia (such as the favicon ) and was a "distinctive part of the Wikipedia brand", was stylized as crossed V's in the original logo, ⟨W⟩ , while the W in Linux Libertine is rendered with a single line. To provide the traditional appearance of the Wikipedia "W", a "crossed" W was added as an OpenType variant to the Linux Libertine font. [1]
On October 24, 2014, the Wikimedia Foundation released the logo, along with all other logos belonging to the Foundation, under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 license. [11]

Trademark
The (former) logo was registered as a European Community Trade Mark by Wikimedia Foundation, Inc. The trade mark bears a filing date of 31 January 2008 and a registration date of 20 January 2009. [12]

Larry Sanger
Lawrence Mark " Larry " Sanger / s æ ŋ ər / [1] (born July 16, 1968 [2] ) is an American Internet project developer, co-founder of Wikipedia , and the founder of Citizendium . [3] [4] [5] He grew up in Anchorage, Alaska . [4] From an early age he has been interested in philosophy. [6] Sanger received a Bachelor of Arts in philosophy from Reed College in 1991 and a Doctor of Philosophy in philosophy from Ohio State University in 2000. [7] Most of his philosophical work has focused on epistemology , the theory of knowledge. [6]
He has been involved with various online encyclopedia projects. [8] He is the former editor-in-chief of Nupedia , [9] chief organizer (2001–02) of its successor, Wikipedia, [10] and founding editor-in-chief of Citizendium. [11] From his position at Nupedia, he assembled the process for article development. [12] Sanger proposed implementing a wiki , which led directly to the creation of Wikipedia. [13] Initially Wikipedia was a complementary project for Nupedia. [13] He was Wikipedia's early community leader [14] and established many of its original policies. [15]
Sanger left Wikipedia in 2002, and has since been critical of the project . [16] [17] He states that, despite its merits, Wikipedia lacks credibility due to, among other things, a lack of respect for expertise . [18] In October 2006, Sanger started a somewhat similar encyclopedia to Wikipedia, Citizendium. [19]
Sanger has taught philosophy at Ohio State University [6] and was an early strategist for the expert-authored Encyclopedia of Earth . [20] He has worked on developing educational projects for individuals behind WatchKnowLearn. [21] He has designed a web-based reading program named Reading Bear which aims to teach children how to read. [22] In February 2013, he attempted to start a news crowdsourcing project named Infobitt; [3] it ran out of money in mid-2015 without the code being ready to handle a fullscale launch. [23] [24]

Early life and education
Sanger was born in Bellevue, Washington . [2] His father was a marine biologist and his mother cared for the children. [25] When he was seven years old, the family moved to Anchorage, Alaska . [4] [26] At an early age, he was interested in philosophical topics. [6] [27]
He graduated from high school in 1986 and went off to Reed College , majoring in philosophy. [27] In college he became interested in the Internet and its publishing abilities. [6] He set up a listserver as a medium for students and tutors to meet up for "expert tutoring" and "to act as a forum for discussion of tutorials, tutorial methods, and the possibility and merits of a voluntary, free network of individual tutors and students finding each other via the Internet for education outside the traditional university setting." [28] He started and moderated a philosophy discussion list, the Association for Systematic Philosophy. [29] Sanger wrote in 1994 a manifesto for the discussion group: "The history of philosophy is full of disagreement and confusion. One reaction by philosophers to this state of things is to doubt whether the truth about philosophy can ever be known, or whether there is any such thing as the truth about philosophy. But there is another reaction: one may set out to think more carefully and methodically than one's intellectual forebears." [26]
Sanger received a Bachelor of Arts degree in philosophy from Reed College in 1991, a Master of Arts from Ohio State University in 1995, and a Doctor of Philosophy from Ohio State University in 2000. [7] Beginning in 1998 he ran a website called "Sanger's Review of Y2K News Reports", a resource for those concerned about the year 2000 problem , such as managers of computer systems. [13]

Philosophy
In 2007, Sanger examined the possibilities for education online . He explained, "Imagine that education were not delivered but organized and managed in a way that were fully digitized, decentralized, self-directed, asynchronous, and at-a-distance." He further stated, "There would be no bureaucracy to enforce anything beyond some very basic rules, and decision-making would be placed almost entirely in the hands of teachers and students." [30]
In 2007, Sanger wrote an essay for the Edge stating in part: "As it turns out, our many Web 2.0 revolutionaries have been so thoroughly seized with the successes of strong collaboration that they are resistant to recognizing some hard truths. As wonderful as it might be that the hegemony of professionals over knowledge is lessening, there is a downside: our grasp of and respect for reliable information suffers. With the rejection of professionalism has come a widespread rejection of expertise—of the proper role in society of people who make it their life's work to know stuff. This, I maintain, is not a positive development; but it is also not a necessary one. We can imagine a Web 2.0 with experts. We can imagine an Internet that is still egalitarian, but which is more open and welcoming to specialists. The new politics of knowledge that I advocate would place experts at the head of the table, but—unlike the old order—gives the general public a place at the table as well." [31]
In 2008, Sanger was at Oxford University to debate the proposition that "the internet is the future of knowledge." Sanger agreed that today's wikis and blogs are fundamentally changing the way knowledge is created and distributed. [32]
In 2010, Sanger wrote an article for Educause stating in part: "In the last several years, many observers of education and learning have been stunned by the abundance of information online, the ever-faster findability of answers, and the productivity of online 'crowds,' which have created information resources like Wikipedia and YouTube. The enormous scope of these developments has surprised me too, despite the fact that they are more or less what many of us had hoped for and deliberately tried to bring into being. These sudden, revolutionary developments demand analysis: How is this latest information explosion changing the way we live? Is the relationship between society and individual changing? More to the point for this article, how is the Internet revolution changing education?" [33]

Nupedia and Wikipedia
Nupedia was a Web-based encyclopedia whose articles, written by volunteer contributors possessing relevant subject matter expertise and reviewed by editors prior to publication, would be licensed as free content. [12] [34] It was co-founded by Jimmy Wales and underwritten by Bomis , with Sanger hired as editor-in-chief. [35] [36] In February 2000, Sanger began to oversee Nupedia. [25] He developed a review process for articles and recruited editors. [12] Articles were reviewed through Nupedia's e-mail system before being posted on the site. [37] With Wales and Sanger frustrated at the slow progress of Nupedia, [38] in January 2001, Sanger proposed a wiki be created to spur article development, and the result of this proposal was Wikipedia , [13] [39] officially launched on January 15, 2001. [40] [41] It was initially intended as a collaborative wiki for the public to write entries that would then be fed into the Nupedia review process of expertise, [13] but the majority of Nupedia's experts wanted little to do with this project. [13] Originally, Bomis planned to make Wikipedia profitable. [42]
Shortly after a blank wiki was set up Sanger wrote the initial pages and promoted the site. [43] To the surprise of Sanger and Wales, within a few days of launching, Wikipedia had outgrown Nupedia, and a small community of editors gathered. [13] By virtue of his position with Nupedia, Sanger ran the project, and formulated much of the original policy, including " Ignore all rules ", " Neutral point of view ", and " Verifiability ". [15] Wikipedia quickly took off, but just months after it was launched, things started to go off the rails, Sanger says, and by the summer of 2001 the new online community was being "overrun" by what he described as "trolls" and "anarchist-types", who were "opposed to the idea that anyone should have any kind of authority that others do not". [44] Sanger responded by proposing a stronger emphasis for expert editors, individuals with the authority to resolve disputes and enforce the rules. [44]
Tired of endless content battles and feeling he had a lack of support from Wales, Sanger eventually left the project. [44] Sanger was the only paid editor of Wikipedia, [8] a status he held from January 15, 2001, until March 1, 2002. In early 2002 Bomis announced plans to sell advertising on Wikipedia in part to pay for Sanger's job, but the project was against any commercialization. [45] Sanger worked on and promoted both the Nupedia and Wikipedia projects until Bomis discontinued funding for his position in February 2002 after the collapse in Internet advertising spending; [46] [47] Sanger resigned as editor-in-chief of Nupedia and as chief organizer of Wikipedia on March 1. [46] Sanger's stated reason for ending his participation in Wikipedia and Nupedia as a volunteer was that he could not do justice to the task as a part-time volunteer. [46] Nupedia shut down in 2003, [48] shortly after Wikipedia's second anniversary. [37]

Origins of Wikipedia
Wales started to play down Sanger's role in the founding of the project in 2005, a few years after Sanger left Wikipedia. [49] [50] [51] In light of Wales' view, Sanger posted on his personal webpage several links which supported his role as a co-founder. [14] Sanger was identified as a co-founder of Wikipedia at least as early as September 2001. [52] Wales identified himself in August 2002 as "co-founder" of Wikipedia. [53] [54] Sanger said "While I was organizing Wikipedia, Wales was in the background and focused on Bomis.com." [55] Wales stated in 2005 that he had initially heard of the wiki concept in 2001 not from Sanger, but instead from Jeremy Rosenfeld. [55] Wales stated in October 2001 that it was "Larry (who) had the idea to use Wiki software for a separate project." [47]
The critical concept of marrying the three fundamental elements of Wikipedia, namely an encyclopedia, a wiki, and essentially unrestricted editorial access to the public, first took form when Sanger met up with an old friend, Ben Kovitz . [8] [10] This meeting occurred at a dinner on January 2, 2001, and it was here that Sanger was first introduced to the functionality of wiki software. Kovitz was a computer programmer and a regular on Ward Cunningham 's wiki . [8] [10] Sanger thought a wiki would be a good platform to use and decided to present the idea to Jimmy Wales, at that time the head of Bomis. [56] [57] Sanger initially proposed the wiki concept to Wales and suggested it be applied to Nupedia and, after some initial skepticism, Wales agreed to try it. [57] [58]
It was Jimmy Wales, along with other people, who came up with the broader idea of an open-source, collaborative encyclopedia that would accept contributions from ordinary people and it was Wales who invested in it. [45] Sanger came up with the name "Wikipedia", which he later said was "a silly name for what was at first a very silly project". [45] [59] Sanger first conceived of the wiki-based encyclopedia project only as a means to hopefully accelerate Nupedia's slow growth. [60] During Wikipedia's critical first year of growth, Sanger spearheaded and guided the following that gathered around this nucleus. [60] Through this early period, he served as Wikipedia's "chief organizer", [61] a position which has not been filled since his departure from Wikipedia. [14] [45] [62] Sanger is also credited with creating and enforcing many of the policies and strategy that made Wikipedia possible during its first formative year. [15] [63] By the end of the year in 2001, the site had about 15,000 articles and upwards of 350 Wikipedians. [57]

Post-Wikipedia
Since Sanger parted ways with Wikipedia in 2002, he has been critical of its accuracy , among other things. [16] In December 2004, Sanger wrote a critical article for the website Kuro5hin , in which he stated that Wikipedia is not perceived as credible among librarians, teachers, and academics when it does not have a formal review process and it is "anti-elitist". [17] [18] In September 2009, Sanger mentioned one reason for distancing himself from Wikipedia: "I thought that the project would never have the amount of credibility it could have if it were not somehow more open and welcoming to experts." [47] He pointed out "The other problem was the community had essentially been taken over by trolls to a great extent. That was a real problem, and Jimmy Wales absolutely refused to do anything about it." [47] Wales responded by stating, "I think very highly of Larry Sanger, and think that it is unfortunate that this silly debate has tended to overshadow his work." [47]
Sanger, a philosophy instructor, [64] began work as a lecturer at The Ohio State University , where he taught philosophy until June 2005. [6] His professional interests are epistemology (in particular), early modern philosophy , and ethics. [6] [27]
In December 2005, Digital Universe Foundation announced that Sanger had been hired as Director of Distributed Content Programs. [65] He would be a key organizer of the Digital Universe Encyclopedia web projects which was launched in early 2006. [66] [67] The Digital Universe encyclopedia has recruited recognized experts to write articles, and to check user-submitted articles for accuracy. [20] The first step in this effort was the expert-authored and edited Encyclopedia of Earth , [20] an electronic reference about the Earth . [68]
The question of accuracy over Wikipedia article content spurred Sanger to unveil plans for a new encyclopedia called Citizendium , short for "citizens' compendium". [69] At the Wizards of OS conference in September 2006, Sanger announced Citizendium as a fork of Wikipedia. The objectives of the fork were to address various perceived flaws in the Wikipedia system. The main differences would be no anonymous editing: every author/editor would have to be identified by his/her real name, no "top-down" hierarchy of editors: it would aspire to be a "real encyclopedia." [70]
In 2015, Sanger was interviewed by Zach Schwartz in Vice . [71] In the interview, he said, among other things, that "I think Wikipedia never solved the problem of how to organize itself in a way that didn't lead to mob rule" and that since he left the project, "People that I would say are trolls sort of took over. The inmates started running the asylum." [71]

Citizendium
On March 25, 2007, Citizendium officially launched. [72] In early 2007, Sanger announced he would not head Citizendium indefinitely. [73] Two weeks after the launch of Citizendium, Sanger criticized Wikipedia, stating the latter was "broken beyond repair," and had a range of problems "from serious management problems, to an often dysfunctional community, to frequently unreliable content, and to a whole series of scandals." [74] Citizendium was an effort by Sanger to establish a scholarly and credible online encyclopedia [73] [75] which aimed to bring more accountability and academic quality to articles. [11] [76]
Ars Technica reporter Timothy B. Lee said in 2011 that Citizendium was "dead in the water". [19] Lee noted that Citizendium's late start was a disadvantage, and that Citizendium's growth was also hindered by an "unwieldy editing model". [19] In 2014, the number of Citizendium contributors was fewer than 100, and the number of edits per day was about "a dozen or so", according to Winthrop University 's Dean of Library Services. [77] Citizendium has about 17,000 articles, of which 160 have been expert reviewed as of August 2016. [78]
Citizendium is wiki-based, but with a few differences from Wikipedia: [79] Prospective contributors on Citizendium were required to sign in using real names in contrast to Wikipedia users who may remain anonymous. [80] [81] The site attempted to implement an expert review process, [79] [82] [83] and experts tried to reach a decision for disputes that cannot be resolved by consensus . [79] After a burst of initial work, however, the site went into decline, and most of the experts left. [19]

Post-Citizendium
In early 2009, Sanger effectively ceased to edit Citizendium, although an announcement confirming this was not made until July 30, 2009, on the Citizendium-l mailinglist. [84] On September 22, 2010, Sanger stepped down as editor-in-chief of Citizendium but said, at the time, that he would continue to support the project. [85]
In April 2010 Sanger sent a letter to the FBI detailing his concern that Wikimedia Commons was hosting child pornography in its pedophilia and lolicon categories later clarified as "obscene visual representations of the abuse of children". [86] [87] Sanger said that he felt it was his "civic duty" to report the images . [88] Sanger told FoxNews.com that, in 2012, he worked with NetSpark to get them to donate or heavily discount its pornographic image filtering technology for use by Wikipedia. [89] NetSpark attempted to contact the Wikimedia Foundation in July/August 2012, but received no response at that time. [89]
In December 2010 Sanger said he considered WikiLeaks "enemies of the U.S. — not just the government, but the people." [90]
He has worked at the WatchKnowLearn project, a non-profit organization which focuses on educating young children using educational videos and other media on the web. [91] Sanger was the executive director of the system. [22] It is a non-profit funded by grants, philanthropists, and the Community Foundation of Northwest Mississippi. [92] Sanger headed the development of WatchKnowLearn from 2008 to 2010. [93] It consists of a repository of educational videos for kindergarten to the 12th grade. [94] In February 2013, it ranked as the No. 1 search result among educational videos on Google 's search engine, with page views surmounting 6 million each month. [95] In 2010 and 2011, he continued working on developing a web-based reading-tutorial application for beginning readers which was launched as Reading Bear in 2012. [21] [22] It uses the principles of phonics , using multimedia presentations such as videos, PowerPoint presentations, and ebooks. [21] In addition to aiming to teach children to pronounce words, it aims to teach the meaning and context of each word. [21]
In February 2013, Sanger announced a project he named Infobitt - a crowdsourced news portal. On Twitter, he wrote: "My new project will show the world how to crowdsource high-quality content—a problem I've long wanted to solve. Not a wiki". [96] The site, which sought to be a crowdsourced news aggregator , went online in December 2014. [3] In July 2015, Sanger announced that the project had run out of money, he had let the programmers go, he was himself looking for a job, and that it was impossible to do a full launch of the project as the code behind it was still only capable of working "at a small scale". [23] The site is no longer active. [97]

Personal life
Sanger moved to San Diego, California , in February 2000 when he was first hired by Wales to develop Nupedia . [98] He was married in Las Vegas, Nevada , in December 2001. [99] In January 2002 he returned to Columbus, Ohio , [26] where he currently resides with his wife and two children. [17]
Sanger supports the concept of baby reading . [100] He says that he started teaching his boy to read before age 2, and he posted videos of his child reading. [100]

Creative Commons license
A Creative Commons ( CC ) license is one of several public copyright licenses that enable the free distribution of an otherwise copyrighted work. A CC license is used when an author wants to give people the right to share, use, and build upon a work that he/she has created. CC provides an author flexibility (for example, he/she might choose to allow only non-commercial uses of his/her own work) and protects the people who use or redistribute an author's work from concerns of copyright infringement as long as they abide by the conditions that are specified in the license by which the author distributes the work.
There are several types of CC licenses. The licenses differ by several combinations that condition the terms of distribution. They were initially released on December 16, 2002 by Creative Commons , a U.S. non-profit corporation founded in 2001. There have also been five versions of the suite of licenses, numbered 1.0 through 4.0. [1] As of 2016 [update] , the 4.0 license suite is the most current.
In October 2014 the Open Knowledge Foundation approved the Creative Commons CC BY , CC BY-SA , and CC0 licenses as conformant with the " Open Definition " for content and data. [2] [3] [4]

Applicable works
Work licensed under a Creative Commons license is governed by applicable copyright law. [5] This allows Creative Commons licenses to be applied to all work falling under copyright, including: books, plays, movies, music, articles, photographs, blogs, and websites. Creative Commons does not recommend the use of Creative Commons licenses for software. [6]
There are over 35,000 works that are available in hardcopy and have a registered ISBN number. Creative Commons splits these works into two categories, one of which encompasses self-published books. [7]
However, application of a Creative Commons license may not modify the rights allowed by fair use or fair dealing or exert restrictions which violate copyright exceptions. [8] Furthermore, Creative Commons licenses are non-exclusive and non-revocable. [9] Any work or copies of the work obtained under a Creative Commons license may continue to be used under that license. [10]
In the case of works protected by multiple Creative Common licenses, the user may choose either. [11]

Types of licenses
The CC licenses all grant the "baseline rights", such as the right to distribute the copyrighted work worldwide for non-commercial purposes, and without modification. [12] The details of each of these licenses depend on the version, and comprises a selection out of four conditions:
The last two clauses are not free content licenses, according to definitions such as DFSG or the Free Software Foundation 's standards, and cannot be used in contexts that require these freedoms, such as Wikipedia . For software , Creative Commons includes three free licenses created by other institutions: the BSD License , the GNU LGPL , and the GNU GPL . [14]
Mixing and matching these conditions produces sixteen possible combinations, of which eleven are valid Creative Commons licenses and five are not. Of the five invalid combinations, four include both the "nd" and "sa" clauses, which are mutually exclusive; and one includes none of the clauses. Of the eleven valid combinations, the five that lack the "by" clause have been retired because 98% of licensors requested attribution, though they do remain available for reference on the website. [15] [16] [17] This leaves six regularly used licenses + the CC0 public domain waiver :

Seven regularly used licenses
[17] [18]
For example, the Creative Commons Attribution (BY) license allows one to share and remix (create derivative works), even for commercial use, so long as attribution is given. [19]

Version 4.0 and international use
The original non-localized Creative Commons licenses were written with the U.S. legal system in mind, therefore the wording may be incompatible with local legislation in other jurisdictions , rendering the licenses unenforceable there. To address this issue, Creative Commons asked its affiliates to translate the various licenses to reflect local laws in a process called " porting ." [20] As of July 2011, Creative Commons licenses have been ported to over 50 jurisdictions worldwide. [21]
The latest version 4.0 of the Creative Commons licenses, released on November 25, 2013, are generic licenses that are applicable to most jurisdictions and do not usually require ports. [22] [23] [24] [25] No new ports have been implemented in version 4.0 of the license. [26] Version 4.0 discourages using ported versions and instead acts as a single global license. [27]

Rights

Attribution
Since 2004, all current licenses (beside the CC0 waiver) require attribution of the original author, the BY component. [16] The attribution must be given to "the best of [one's] ability using the information available". [28] Generally this implies the following:

Non-commercial licenses
The "non-commercial" option included in some Creative Commons licenses is controversial in definition, [29] as it is sometimes unclear what can be considered a non-commercial setting, and application, since its restrictions differ from the principles of open content promoted by other permissive licenses . [30] In 2014 Wikimedia Deutschland published a guide to using Creative Commons licenses as wiki pages for translations and as PDF. [31]

Zero / public domain
Besides licenses, Creative Commons also offers through CC0 a way to release material worldwide into the public domain . [18] CC0 is a legal tool for waiving as many rights as legally possible. [33] Or, when not legally possible, CC0 acts as fallback as public domain equivalent license . [33] Development of CC0 began in 2007 [34] and the tool was released in 2009. [35] [36] A major target of the license was the scientific data community. [37]
In 2010, Creative Commons announced its Public Domain Mark , [38] a tool for labeling works already in the public domain. Together, CC0 and the Public Domain Mark replace the Public Domain Dedication and Certification, [39] which took a U.S.-centric approach and co-mingled distinct operations.
In 2011, the Free Software Foundation added CC0 to its free software licenses , [40] and currently recommends CC0 as the preferred method of releasing software into the public domain . [41]
In February 2012 CC0 was submitted to Open Source Initiative (OSI) for their approval. [42] However, controversy arose over its clause which excluded from the scope of the license any relevant patents held by the copyright holder. This clause was added with scientific data in mind rather than software, but some members of the OSI believed it could weaken users' defenses against software patents . As a result, Creative Commons withdrew their submission, and the license is not currently approved by the OSI. [37] [43]
In 2013, Unsplash began using the CC0 license to distribute free stock photography . [44] [45] It now distributes several million photos a month [46] and has inspired a host of similar sites, including CC0 photography companies and CC0 blogging companies. [47] Lawrence Lessig , the founder of Creative Commons, has contributed to the site. [48] [ dead link ]
In October 2014 the Open Knowledge Foundation approved the Creative Commons CC0 as conformant with the "Open Definition" and recommend the license to dedicate content to the public domain. [3] [4]

Adaptation
Rights in an adaptation can be expressed by a CC license that is compatible with the status or licensing of the original work or works on which the adaptation is based. [49]

Legal aspects
The legal implications of large numbers of works having Creative Commons licensing are difficult to predict, and there is speculation that media creators often lack insight to be able to choose the license which best meets their intent in applying it. [50]
Some works licensed using Creative Commons licenses have been involved in several court cases. [51] Creative Commons itself was not a party to any of these cases; they only involved licensors or licensees of Creative Commons licenses. When the cases went as far as decisions by judges (that is, they were not dismissed for lack of jurisdiction or were not settled privately out of court), they have all validated the legal robustness of Creative Commons public licenses. Here are some notable cases:

Dutch tabloid
In early 2006, podcaster Adam Curry sued a Dutch tabloid who published photos from Curry's Flickr page without Curry's permission. The photos were licensed under the Creative Commons Non-Commercial license. While the verdict was in favor of Curry, the tabloid avoided having to pay restitution to him as long as they did not repeat the offense. Professor Bernt Hugenholtz, main creator of the Dutch CC license and director of the Institute for Information Law of the University of Amsterdam, commented, "The Dutch Court's decision is especially noteworthy because it confirms that the conditions of a Creative Commons license automatically apply to the content licensed under it, and binds users of such content even without expressly agreeing to, or having knowledge of, the conditions of the license." [52] [53] [54] [55]

Virgin Mobile
In 2007, Virgin Mobile Australia launched an Australian bus stop ad campaign promoting their cellphone text messaging service using the work of amateur photographers who uploaded their work to Flickr using a Creative Commons-BY (Attribution) license. Users licensing their images this way freed their work for use by any other entity, as long as the original creator was attributed credit, without any other compensation required. Virgin upheld this single restriction by printing a URL leading to the photographer's Flickr page on each of their ads. However, one picture, depicting 15-year-old Alison Chang at a fund-raising carwash for her church, [56] caused some controversy when she sued Virgin Mobile. The photo was taken by Alison's church youth counselor, Justin Ho-Wee Wong, who uploaded the image to Flickr under the Creative Commons license. [56] In 2008, the case (concerning personality rights rather than copyright as such) was thrown out of a Texas court for lack of jurisdiction. [57] [58]

SGAE vs Fernández
In the fall of 2006, the collecting society Sociedad General de Autores y Editores ( SGAE ) in Spain sued Ricardo Andrés Utrera Fernández, owner of a disco bar located in Badajoz who played CC-licensed music. SGAE argued that Fernández should pay royalties for public performance of the music between November 2002 and August 2005. The Lower Court rejected the collecting society's claims because the owner of the bar proved that the music he was using was not managed by the society. [59]
In February 2006, the Cultural Association Ladinamo (based in Madrid, and represented by Javier de la Cueva ) was granted the use of copyleft music in their public activities. The sentence said: "Admitting the existence of music equipment, a joint evaluation of the evidence practiced, this court is convinced that the defendant prevents communication of works whose management is entrusted to the plaintiff [SGAE], using a repertoire of authors who have not assigned the exploitation of their rights to the SGAE, having at its disposal a database for that purpose and so it is manifested both by the legal representative of the Association and by Manuela Villa Acosta, in charge of the cultural programming of the association, which is compatible with the alternative character of the Association and its integration in the movement called ' copy left '". [60]

GateHouse Media, Inc. vs. That's Great News, LLC
On June 30, 2010 GateHouse Media filed a lawsuit against That's Great News . GateHouse Media owns a number of local newspapers, including Rockford Register Star , which is based in Rockford, Illinois. That's Great News makes plaques out of newspaper articles and sells them to the people featured in the articles. [61] GateHouse sued That's Great News for copyright infringement and breach of contract. GateHouse claimed that TGN violated the non-commercial and no-derivative works restrictions on GateHouse Creative Commons licensed work when TGN published the material on its website. The case was settled on August 17, 2010, though the settlement was not made public. [61] [62]

Drauglis v. Kappa Map Group, LLC
The plaintiff was photographer Art Drauglis, who uploaded several pictures to the photo-sharing website Flickr using Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 2.0 Generic License (CC BY-SA), including one entitled "Swain's Lock, Montgomery Co., MD.". The defendant was Kappa Map Group, a map-making company, which downloaded the image and used it in a compilation entitled "Montgomery Co. Maryland Street Atlas". Though there was nothing on the cover that indicated the origin of the picture, the text " Photo: Swain's Lock, Montgomery Co., MD Photographer: Carly Lesser & Art Drauglis, Creative Commoms [ sic ] , CC-BY-SA-2.0 " appeared at the bottom of the back cover.
The validity of the CC BY-SA 2.0 as a license was not in dispute. The CC BY-SA 2.0 requires that the licensee to use nothing less restrictive than the CC BY-SA 2.0 terms. The atlas was sold commercially and not for free reuse by others. The dispute was whether Drauglis' license terms that would apply to "derivative works" applied to the entire atlas. Drauglis sued the defendants on June 2014 for copyright infringement and license breach, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, damages, fees, and costs. Drauglis asserted, among other things, that Kappa Map Group "exceeded the scope of the License because defendant did not publish the Atlas under a license with the same or similar terms as those under which the Photograph was originally licensed." [63] The judge dismissed the case on that count, ruling that the atlas was not a derivative work of the photograph in the sense of the license. Since the atlas was not a derivative work of the photograph, Kappa Map Group did not need to license the entire atlas under the CC BY-SA 2.0 license. The judge also determined that the work had been properly attributed. [64]

Verband zum Schutz geistigen Eigentums im Internet (VGSE)
This incident has not been tested in court, but it highlights a potentially disturbing practice. In July 2016, German computer magazine LinuxUser reports that a German blogger Christoph Langner used two CC-BY licensed photographs from Berlin photographer Dennis Skley on his private blog Linuxundich.de . Langner duly mentioned the author and the license and added a link to the original. Langner was later contacted by the Verband zum Schutz geistigen Eigentums im Internet (VGSE) (Association for the Protection of Intellectual Property in the Internet) with a demand for €2300 for failing to provide the full name of the work, the full name of the author, the license text, and a source link, as is apparently required by the fine print in the license. Of this sum, €40 goes to the photographer and remainder is retained by VGSE. [65] [66]

Works with a Creative Commons license
Creative Commons maintains a content directory wiki of organizations and projects using Creative Commons licenses. [67] On its website CC also provides case studies of projects using CC licenses across the world. [68] CC licensed content can also be accessed through a number of content directories and search engines (see CC licensed content directories ).

Retired licenses
Due to either disuse or criticism, a number of previously offered Creative Commons licenses have since been retired, [15] [69] and are no longer recommended for new works. The retired licenses include all licenses lacking the Attribution element other than CC0, as well as the following four licenses:

Reference work
A reference work is a book or periodical (or its electronic equivalent ) to which one can refer for information . The information is intended to be found quickly when needed. Reference works are usually referred to for particular pieces of information, rather than read beginning to end. The writing style used in these works is informative; the authors avoid use of the first person, and emphasize facts. Many reference works are compiled by a team of contributors whose work is coordinated by one or more editors rather than by an individual author. Indices are commonly provided in many types of reference work. Updated editions are usually published as needed, in some cases annually (e.g. Whitaker's Almanack , Who's Who ). Reference works include dictionaries , thesauruses , encyclopedias , almanacs , bibliographies , and catalogs (e.g. catalogs of libraries, museums or the works of individual artists). [1] Many reference works are available in electronic form and can be obtained as application software , CD-ROMs , DVDs , or online through the Internet .
A reference work is useful to its users if they attribute some degree of trust .

Reference book
In comparison, a reference book or reference-only book in a library is one that may only be used in the library and may not be borrowed from the library. Many such books are reference works (in the first sense), which are, usually, used briefly or photocopied from, and, therefore, do not need to be borrowed. Keeping them in the library assures that they will always be available for use on demand. Some reference-only books are too valuable to permit borrowers to take them out. Reference-only items may be shelved in a reference collection located separately from circulating items. Some libraries consist entirely, or to a large extent, of books which may not be borrowed.

Electronic resources
An electronic resource is a piece of information that is stored electronically, which is usually found on a computer, including information available on the internet. [2] Libraries offer many types of electronic resources: subject research guides, indices, electronic books and texts, electronic journals, library catalogs, reference sources, statistical sources, sound recordings, and image databases.

Encyclopædia Britannica
The Encyclopædia Britannica ( Latin for "British Encyclopaedia"), published by Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. , is a general knowledge English-language encyclopaedia . It is written by about 100 full-time editors and more than 4,000 contributors, who have included 110 Nobel Prize winners and five American presidents . The 2010 version of the 15th edition, which spans 32 volumes [1] and 32,640 pages, was the last printed edition; digital content and distribution has continued since then.
The Britannica is the oldest English-language encyclopaedia still in production. It was first published between 1768 and 1771 in the Scottish capital of Edinburgh , as three volumes. The encyclopaedia grew in size: the second edition was 10 volumes, and by its fourth edition (1801–1810) it had expanded to 20 volumes. Its rising stature as a scholarly work helped recruit eminent contributors, and the 9th (1875–1889) and 11th editions (1911) are landmark encyclopaedias for scholarship and literary style. Beginning with the 11th edition and following its acquisition by an American firm, the Britannica shortened and simplified articles to broaden its appeal to the North American market. In 1933, the Britannica became the first encyclopaedia to adopt "continuous revision", in which the encyclopaedia is continually reprinted, with every article updated on a schedule. In March 2012, Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. announced it would no longer publish printed editions, and would focus instead on Encyclopædia Britannica Online .
The 15th edition has a three-part structure: a 12-volume Micropædia of short articles (generally fewer than 750 words), a 17-volume Macropædia of long articles (two to 310 pages), and a single Propædia volume to give a hierarchical outline of knowledge. The Micropædia is meant for quick fact-checking and as a guide to the Macropædia ; readers are advised to study the Propædia outline to understand a subject's context and to find more detailed articles. Over 70 years, the size of the Britannica has remained steady, with about 40 million words on half a million topics. Though published in the United States since 1901, the Britannica has for the most part maintained British English spelling .

Present status

Print version
Since 1985, the Britannica has had four parts: the Micropædia , the Macropædia , the Propædia , and a two-volume index. The Britannica' s articles are found in the Micro- and Macropædia , which encompass 12 and 17 volumes, respectively, each volume having roughly one thousand pages. The 2007 Macropædia has 699 in-depth articles, ranging in length from 2 to 310 pages and having references and named contributors. In contrast, the 2007 Micropædia has roughly 65,000 articles, the vast majority (about 97%) of which contain fewer than 750 words, no references, and no named contributors. [2] The Micropædia articles are intended for quick fact-checking and to help in finding more thorough information in the Macropædia . The Macropædia articles are meant both as authoritative, well-written articles on their subjects and as storehouses of information not covered elsewhere. [3] The longest article (310 pages) is on the United States, and resulted from the merger of the articles on the individual states. The 2013 edition of Britannica contained approximately forty thousand articles. [4]
Information can be found in the Britannica by following the cross-references in the Micropædia and Macropædia ; however, these are sparse, averaging one cross-reference per page. [5] Hence, readers are recommended to consult instead the alphabetical index or the Propædia , which organises the Britannica' s contents by topic. [6]
The core of the Propædia is its "Outline of Knowledge", which aims to provide a logical framework for all human knowledge. [7] Accordingly, the Outline is consulted by the Britannica' s editors to decide which articles should be included in the Micro- and Macropædia . [7] The Outline is also intended to be a study guide, to put subjects in their proper perspective, and to suggest a series of Britannica articles for the student wishing to learn a topic in depth. [7] However, libraries have found that it is scarcely used, and reviewers have recommended that it be dropped from the encyclopaedia. [8] The Propædia also has color transparencies of human anatomy and several appendices listing the staff members, advisors, and contributors to all three parts of the Britannica.
Taken together, the Micropædia and Macropædia comprise roughly 40 million words and 24,000 images. [6] The two-volume index has 2,350 pages, listing the 228,274 topics covered in the Britannica , together with 474,675 subentries under those topics. [5] The Britannica generally prefers British spelling over American ; [5] for example, it uses colour (not color ), centre (not center ), and encyclopaedia (not encyclopedia ). However, there are exceptions to this rule, such as defense rather than defence . [9] Common alternative spellings are provided with cross-references such as "Color: see Colour."
Since 1936, the articles of the Britannica have been revised on a regular schedule, with at least 10% of them considered for revision each year. [5] [10] According to one Britannica website, 46% of its articles were revised over the past three years; [11] however, according to another Britannica web-site, only 35% of the articles were revised. [12]
The alphabetisation of articles in the Micropædia and Macropædia follows strict rules. [13] Diacritical marks and non-English letters are ignored, while numerical entries such as " 1812, War of " are alphabetised as if the number had been written out ("Eighteen-twelve, War of"). Articles with identical names are ordered first by persons, then by places, then by things. Rulers with identical names are organised first alphabetically by country and then by chronology; thus, Charles III of France precedes Charles I of England , listed in Britannica as the ruler of Great Britain and Ireland. (That is, they are alphabetised as if their titles were "Charles, France, 3" and "Charles, Great Britain and Ireland, 1".) Similarly, places that share names are organised alphabetically by country, then by ever-smaller political divisions.
In March 2012, the company announced that the 2010 edition would be the last printed version. This was announced as a move by the company to adapt to the times and focus on its future using digital distribution. [14] The peak year for the printed encyclopaedia was 1990 when 120,000 sets were sold, but it dropped to 40,000 in 1996. [15] 12,000 sets of the 2010 edition were printed, of which 8,000 had been sold as of 2012 [update] . [16] By late April 2012, the remaining copies of the 2010 edition had sold out at Britannica's online store. As of 2016, a replica of Britannica's 1768 first edition is sold on the online store. [17]

A British Children's Britannica edited by John Armitage was issued in London in 1960. [19] Its contents were determined largely by the eleven-plus standardised tests given in Britain. [20] Britannica introduced the Children's Britannica to the U.S. market in 1988, aimed at ages 7 to 14.
In 1961 a 16 volume Young Children's Encyclopaedia was issued for children just learning to read. [20]
My First Britannica is aimed at children ages six to twelve, and the Britannica Discovery Library is for children aged three to six (issued 1974 to 1991). [21]
There have been and are several abridged Britannica encyclopaedias. The single-volume Britannica Concise Encyclopædia has 28,000 short articles condensing the larger 32-volume Britannica ; [22] there are authorized translations in languages such as Chinese [23] and Vietnamese . [24] [25] Compton's by Britannica , first published in 2007, incorporating the former Compton's Encyclopedia , is aimed at 10- to 17-year-olds and consists of 26 volumes and 11,000 pages. [26]
Since 1938, Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. has published annually a Book of the Year covering the past year's events. A given edition of the Book of the Year is named in terms of the year of its publication, though the edition actually covers the events of the previous year. Articles dating back to the 1994 edition are included online. [27] The company also publishes several specialised reference works, such as Shakespeare: The Essential Guide to the Life and Works of the Bard (Wiley, 2006).

Optical disc, online, and mobile versions
The Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite 2012 DVD contains over 100,000 articles. [28] This includes regular Britannica articles, as well as others drawn from the Britannica Student Encyclopædia , and the Britannica Elementary Encyclopædia. The package includes a range of supplementary content including maps, videos, sound clips, animations and web links. It also offers study tools and dictionary and thesaurus entries from Merriam-Webster .
Britannica Online is a website with more than 120,000 articles and is updated regularly. [29] It has daily features, updates and links to news reports from The New York Times and the BBC . As of 2009 [update] , roughly 60% of Encyclopædia Britannica's revenue came from online operations, of which around 15% came from subscriptions to the consumer version of the websites. [30] As of 2006 [update] , subscriptions were available on a yearly, monthly or weekly basis. [31] Special subscription plans are offered to schools, colleges and libraries; such institutional subscribers constitute an important part of Britannica's business. Beginning in early 2007, the Britannica made articles freely available if they are hyperlinked from an external site. Non-subscribers are served pop-ups and advertising. [32]
On 20 February 2007, Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. announced that it was working with mobile phone search company AskMeNow to launch a mobile encyclopaedia. [33] Users will be able to send a question via text message , and AskMeNow will search Britannica' s 28,000-article concise encyclopaedia to return an answer to the query. Daily topical features sent directly to users' mobile phones are also planned. On 3 June 2008, an initiative to facilitate collaboration between online expert and amateur scholarly contributors for Britannica's online content (in the spirit of a wiki ), with editorial oversight from Britannica staff, was announced. [34] [35] Approved contributions would be credited, [36] though contributing automatically grants Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. perpetual, irrevocable license to those contributions. [37]
On 22 January 2009, Britannica's president, Jorge Cauz , announced that the company would be accepting edits and additions to the online Britannica website from the public. The published edition of the encyclopaedia will not be affected by the changes. [38] Individuals wishing to edit the Britannica website will have to register under their real name and address prior to editing or submitting their content. [39] All edits submitted will be reviewed and checked and will have to be approved by the encyclopaedia's professional staff. [39] Contributions from non-academic users will sit in a separate section from the expert-generated Britannica content, [40] as will content submitted by non- Britannica scholars. [41] Articles written by users, if vetted and approved, will also only be available in a special section of the website, separate from the professional articles. [38] [41] Official Britannica material would carry a "Britannica Checked" stamp, to distinguish it from the user-generated content. [42]
On 14 September 2010, Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. announced a partnership with mobile phone development company Concentric Sky to launch a series of iPhone products aimed at the K-12 market. [43] On 20 July 2011, Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. announced that Concentric Sky had ported the Britannica Kids product line to Intel's Intel Atom -based Netbooks [44] [45] and on 26 October 2011 that it had launched its encyclopedia as an iPad app . [46]
In March 2012, it was announced that the company would cease printing the encyclopaedia set, and that it would focus more on its online version.

Personnel and management

Contributors
The 2007 print version of the Britannica has 4,411 contributors, many eminent in their fields, such as Nobel laureate economist Milton Friedman , astronomer Carl Sagan , and surgeon Michael DeBakey . [47] Roughly a quarter of the contributors are deceased, some as long ago as 1947 ( Alfred North Whitehead ), while another quarter are retired or emeritus . Most (approximately 98%) contribute to only a single article; however, 64 contributed to three articles, 23 contributed to four articles, 10 contributed to five articles, and 8 contributed to more than five articles. An exceptionally prolific contributor is Christine Sutton of the University of Oxford , who contributed 24 articles on particle physics .
While Britannica' s authors have included writers such as Albert Einstein , Marie Curie , and Leon Trotsky , as well as notable independent encyclopaedists such as Isaac Asimov , some have been criticised for lack of expertise: [48]

Staff
As of 2007 [update] in the fifteenth edition of Britannica , Dale Hoiberg , a sinologist , was listed as Britannica's Senior Vice President and editor-in-chief. [49] Among his predecessors as editors-in-chief were Hugh Chisholm (1902–1924), James Louis Garvin (1926–1932), Franklin Henry Hooper (1932–1938), [50] Walter Yust (1938–1960), Harry Ashmore (1960–1963), Warren E. Preece (1964–1968, 1969–1975), Sir William Haley (1968–1969), Philip W. Goetz (1979–1991), [3] and Robert McHenry (1992–1997). [51] As of 2007 [update] Anita Wolff was listed as the Deputy Editor and Theodore Pappas as Executive Editor. [49] Prior Executive Editors include John V. Dodge (1950–1964) and Philip W. Goetz.
Paul T. Armstrong remains the longest working employee of Encyclopædia Britannica. He began his career there in 1934, eventually earning the positions of Treasurer, Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer in his 58 years with the company, before retiring in 1992. [52]
The 2007 editorial staff of the Britannica included five Senior Editors and nine Associate Editors, supervised by Dale Hoiberg and four others. The editorial staff helped to write the articles of the Micropædia and some sections of the Macropædia . [53] The preparation and publication of the Encyclopædia Britannica required trained staff. According to the final page of the 2007 Propædia , the staff were organised into ten departments: [54]
Some of these departments were organised hierarchically . For example, the copy editors were divided into 4 copy editors, 2 senior copy editors, 4 supervisors, plus a coordinator and a director. Similarly, the Editorial department was headed by Dale Hoiberg and assisted by four others; they oversaw the work of five senior editors, nine associate editors, and one executive assistant.

Editorial advisors
The Britannica has an Editorial Board of Advisors, which includes 12 distinguished scholars: [55] [56] non-fiction author Nicholas Carr , religion scholar Wendy Doniger , political economist Benjamin M. Friedman , Council on Foreign Relations President Emeritus Leslie H. Gelb , computer scientist David Gelernter , Physics Nobel laureate Murray Gell-Mann , Carnegie Corporation of New York President Vartan Gregorian , philosopher Thomas Nagel , cognitive scientist Donald Norman , musicologist Don Michael Randel , Stewart Sutherland, Baron Sutherland of Houndwood , President of the Royal Society of Edinburgh , and cultural anthropologist Michael Wesch .
The Propædia and its Outline of Knowledge were produced by dozens of editorial advisors under the direction of Mortimer J. Adler . [57] Roughly half of these advisors have since died, including some of the Outline's chief architects — Rene Dubos (d. 1982), Loren Eiseley (d. 1977), Harold D. Lasswell (d. 1978), Mark Van Doren (d. 1972), Peter Ritchie Calder (d. 1982) and Mortimer J. Adler (d. 2001). The Propædia also lists just under 4,000 advisors who were consulted for the unsigned Micropædia articles. [58]

Corporate structure
In January 1996, the Britannica was purchased from the Benton Foundation by billionaire Swiss financier Jacqui Safra , [59] who serves as its current Chair of the Board. In 1997, Don Yannias , a long-time associate and investment advisor of Safra, became CEO of Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. [60] In 1999, a new company, Britannica.com Inc. , was created to develop digital versions of the Britannica ; Yannias assumed the role of CEO in the new company, while his former position at the parent company remained vacant for two years. Yannias' tenure at Britannica.com Inc. was marked by missteps, considerable lay-offs, and financial losses. [61] In 2001, Yannias was replaced by Ilan Yeshua , who reunited the leadership of the two companies. [62] Yannias later returned to investment management, but remains on the Britannica ′s Board of Directors.
In 2003, former management consultant Jorge Aguilar-Cauz was appointed President of Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. Cauz is the senior executive and reports directly to the Britannica's Board of Directors. Cauz has been pursuing alliances with other companies and extending the Britannica brand to new educational and reference products, continuing the strategy pioneered by former CEO Elkan Harrison Powell in the mid-1930s. [63]
Under Safra's ownership, the company has experienced financial difficulties, and has responded by reducing the price of its products and implementing drastic cost cuts. According to a 2003 report in the New York Post , the Britannica management has eliminated employee 401(k) accounts and encouraged the use of free images. These changes have had negative impacts, as freelance contributors have waited up to six months for checks and the Britannica staff have gone years without pay rises. [64]

Competition
As the Britannica is a general encyclopaedia, it does not seek to compete with specialised encyclopaedias such as the Encyclopaedia of Mathematics or the Dictionary of the Middle Ages , which can devote much more space to their chosen topics. In its first years, the Britannica' s main competitor was the general encyclopaedia of Ephraim Chambers and, soon thereafter, Rees's Cyclopædia and Coleridge's Encyclopædia Metropolitana . In the 20th century, successful competitors included Collier's Encyclopedia , the Encyclopedia Americana , and the World Book Encyclopedia . Nevertheless, from the 9th edition onwards, the Britannica was widely considered to have the greatest authority of any general English language encyclopaedia, [65] especially because of its broad coverage and eminent authors. [3] [5] The print version of the Britannica was significantly more expensive than its competitors. [3] [5]
Since the early 1990s, the Britannica has faced new challenges from digital information sources. The Internet, facilitated by the development of search engines , has grown into a common source of information for many people, and provides easy access to reliable original sources and expert opinions, thanks in part to initiatives such as Google Books , MIT 's release of its educational materials and the open PubMed Central library of the National Library of Medicine . [66] [67] In general, the Internet tends to provide more current coverage than print media, due to the ease with which material on the Internet can be updated. [68] In rapidly changing fields such as science, technology, politics, culture and modern history, the Britannica has struggled to stay up-to-date, a problem first analysed systematically by its former editor Walter Yust . [69] Eventually, the Britannica turned to focus more on its online edition.

Print encyclopaedias
The Encyclopædia Britannica has been compared with other print encyclopaedias, both qualitatively and quantitatively. [2] [3] [5] A well-known comparison is that of Kenneth Kister , who gave a qualitative and quantitative comparison of the Britannica with two comparable encyclopaedias, Collier's Encyclopedia and the Encyclopedia Americana . [3] For the quantitative analysis, ten articles were selected at random— circumcision , Charles Drew , Galileo , Philip Glass , heart disease , IQ , panda bear , sexual harassment , Shroud of Turin and Uzbekistan —and letter grades of A–D or F were awarded in four categories: coverage, accuracy, clarity, and recency. In all four categories and for all three encyclopaedias, the four average grades fell between B− and B+ , chiefly because none of the encyclopaedias had an article on sexual harassment in 1994. In the accuracy category, the Britannica received one "D" and seven "A"s, Encyclopedia Americana received eight "A"s, and Collier's received one "D" and seven "A"s; thus, Britannica received an average score of 92% for accuracy to Americana ' s 95% and Collier's 92%. In the timeliness category, Britannica averaged an 86% to Americana' s 90% and Collier's 85%.

Digital encyclopaedias on optical media
The most notable competitor of the Britannica among CD/DVD-ROM digital encyclopaedias was Encarta , [70] now discontinued, a modern, multimedia encyclopaedia that incorporated three print encyclopaedias: Funk & Wagnalls , Collier's and the New Merit Scholar's Encyclopedia . Encarta was the top-selling multimedia encyclopaedia, based on total US retail sales from January 2000 to February 2006. [71] Both occupied the same price range, with the 2007 Encyclopædia Britannica Ultimate CD or DVD costing US$40–50 [72] [73] and the Microsoft Encarta Premium 2007 DVD costing US$45. [74] The Britannica contains 100,000 articles and Merriam-Webster's Dictionary and Thesaurus (US only), and offers Primary and Secondary School editions. [73] Encarta contained 66,000 articles, a user-friendly Visual Browser, interactive maps, math, language and homework tools, a US and UK dictionary, and a youth edition. [74] Like Encarta , the Britannica has been criticised for being biased towards United States audiences; the United Kingdom-related articles are updated less often, maps of the United States are more detailed than those of other countries, and it lacks a UK dictionary. [70] Like the Britannica , Encarta was available online by subscription, although some content could be accessed for free. [75]

Internet encyclopedias
The dominant internet encyclopaedia and main alternative to Britannica is the multilingual, Web -based, free-content encyclopaedia, Wikipedia . [76] [77] The key differences between the two lie in accessibility; the model of participation they bring to an encyclopedic project ; their respective style sheets and editorial policies; relative ages; the number of subjects treated; the number of languages in which articles are written and made available; and their underlying economic models: unlike Britannica, Wikipedia is a not-for-profit and is not connected with traditional profit- and contract-based publishing distribution networks.
The 699 printed Macropædia articles are generally written by identified contributors, and the roughly 65,000 printed Micropædia articles are the work of the editorial staff and identified outside consultants. Thus, a Britannica article either has known authorship or a set of possible authors (the editorial staff). With the exception of the editorial staff, most of the Britannica' s contributors are experts in their field—some are Nobel laureates. [47] By contrast, the articles of Wikipedia are written by people of unknown degrees of expertise: most do not claim any particular expertise, and of those who do, many are anonymous and have no verifiable credentials. [78] It is for this lack of institutional vetting, or certification, that former Britannica editor-in-chief Robert McHenry notes his belief that Wikipedia cannot hope to rival the Britannica in accuracy. [79]
In 2005, the journal Nature chose articles from both websites in a wide range of science topics and sent them to what it called "relevant" field experts for peer review. The experts then compared the competing articles—one from each site on a given topic—side by side, but were not told which article came from which site. Nature got back 42 usable reviews.
In the end, the journal found just eight serious errors, such as general misunderstandings of vital concepts: four from each site. It also discovered many factual errors, omissions or misleading statements: 162 in Wikipedia and 123 in Britannica , an average of 3.86 mistakes per article for Wikipedia and 2.92 for Britannica . [78] [80] Although Britannica was revealed as the more accurate encyclopedia, with lesser errors, Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. in its detailed 20-page rebuttal called Nature' s study flawed and misleading [81] and called for a "prompt" retraction. It noted that two of the articles in the study were taken from a Britannica yearbook and not the encyclopaedia, and another two were from Compton's Encyclopedia (called the Britannica Student Encyclopedia on the company's website). The rebuttal went on to mention that some of the articles presented to reviewers were combinations of several articles, and that other articles were merely excerpts but were penalised for factual omissions. The company also noted that several of what Nature called errors were minor spelling variations, and that others were matters of interpretation. Nature defended its story and declined to retract, stating that, as it was comparing Wikipedia with the web version of Britannica , it used whatever relevant material was available on Britannica ' s website. [82]
Interviewed in February 2009, the managing director of Britannica UK said:

Critical and popular assessments

Reputation
Since the 3rd edition, the Britannica has enjoyed a popular and critical reputation for general excellence. [2] [3] [5] The 3rd and the 9th editions were pirated for sale in the United States, [83] beginning with Dobson's Encyclopaedia . [84] On the release of the 14th edition, Time magazine dubbed the Britannica the "Patriarch of the Library". [85] In a related advertisement, naturalist William Beebe was quoted as saying that the Britannica was "beyond comparison because there is no competitor." [86] References to the Britannica can be found throughout English literature , most notably in one of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle 's favourite Sherlock Holmes stories, " The Red-Headed League ". The tale was highlighted by the Lord Mayor of London , Gilbert Inglefield, at the bicentennial of the Britannica . [87]
The Britannica has a reputation for summarising knowledge. [65] To further their education, some people have devoted themselves to reading the entire Britannica , taking anywhere from three to 22 years to do so. [83] When Fat'h Ali became the Shah of Persia in 1797, he was given a set of the Britannica's 3rd edition, which he read completely; after this feat, he extended his royal title to include "Most Formidable Lord and Master of the Encyclopædia Britannica ". [87] Writer George Bernard Shaw claimed to have read the complete 9th edition—except for the science articles [83] —and Richard Evelyn Byrd took the Britannica as reading material for his five-month stay at the South Pole in 1934, while Philip Beaver read it during a sailing expedition. More recently, A.J. Jacobs , an editor at Esquire magazine, read the entire 2002 version of the 15th edition, describing his experiences in the well-received 2004 book, The Know-It-All: One Man's Humble Quest to Become the Smartest Person in the World . Only two people are known to have read two independent editions: the author C. S. Forester [83] and Amos Urban Shirk , an American businessman, who read the 11th and 14th editions, devoting roughly three hours per night for four and a half years to read the 11th. [88] Several editors-in-chief of the Britannica are likely to have read their editions completely, such as William Smellie (1st edition), William Robertson Smith (9th edition), and Walter Yust (14th edition).

Awards
The CD/DVD-ROM version of the Britannica , Encyclopædia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite , received the 2004 Distinguished Achievement Award from the Association of Educational Publishers . [89] On 15 July 2009, Encyclopædia Britannica was awarded a spot as one of "Top Ten Superbrands in the UK" by a panel of more than 2,000 independent reviewers, as reported by the BBC. [90]

Coverage of topics
Topics are chosen in part by reference to the Propædia "Outline of Knowledge". [7] The bulk of the Britannica is devoted to geography (26% of the Macropædia ), biography (14%), biology and medicine (11%), literature (7%), physics and astronomy (6%), religion (5%), art (4%), Western philosophy (4%), and law (3%). [3] A complementary study of the Micropædia found that geography accounted for 25% of articles, science 18%, social sciences 17%, biography 17%, and all other humanities 25%. [5] Writing in 1992, one reviewer judged that the "range, depth, and catholicity of coverage [of the Britannica ] are unsurpassed by any other general Encyclopaedia." [91]
The Britannica does not cover topics in equivalent detail; for example, the whole of Buddhism and most other religions is covered in a single Macropædia article, whereas 14 articles are devoted to Christianity, comprising nearly half of all religion articles. [92] However, the Britannica has been lauded as the least biased of general Encyclopaedias marketed to Western readers [3] and praised for its biographies of important women of all eras. [5]

Criticism of editorial decisions
On rare occasions, the Britannica was criticised for its editorial choices. Given its roughly constant size, the encyclopaedia has needed to reduce or eliminate some topics to accommodate others, resulting in controversial decisions. The initial 15th edition (1974–1985) was faulted for having reduced or eliminated coverage of children's literature, military decorations , and the French poet Joachim du Bellay ; editorial mistakes were also alleged, such as inconsistent sorting of Japanese biographies. [93] Its elimination of the index was condemned, as was the apparently arbitrary division of articles into the Micropædia and Macropædia . [3] [94] Summing up, one critic called the initial 15th edition a "qualified failure...[that] cares more for juggling its format than for preserving." [93] More recently, reviewers from the American Library Association were surprised to find that most educational articles had been eliminated from the 1992 Macropædia , along with the article on psychology . [8]
Some very few Britannica -appointed contributors are mistaken. A notorious instance from the Britannica's early years is the rejection of Newtonian gravity by George Gleig , the chief editor of the 3rd edition (1788–1797), who wrote that gravity was caused by the classical element of fire . [83] The Britannica has also staunchly defended a scientific approach to cultural topics, as it did with William Robertson Smith 's articles on religion in the 9th edition, particularly his article stating that the Bible was not historically accurate (1875). [83]

Other criticisms
The Britannica has received criticism, especially as editions become outdated. It is expensive to produce a completely new edition of the Britannica, [95] and its editors delay for as long as fiscally sensible (usually about 25 years). [10] For example, despite continuous revision, the 14th edition became outdated after 35 years (1929–1964). When American physicist Harvey Einbinder detailed its failings in his 1964 book, The Myth of the Britannica , [96] the encyclopaedia was provoked to produce the 15th edition, which required 10 years of work. [3] It is still difficult to keep the Britannica current; one recent critic writes, "it is not difficult to find articles that are out-of-date or in need of revision", noting that the longer Macropædia articles are more likely to be outdated than the shorter Micropædia articles. [3] Information in the Micropædia is sometimes inconsistent with the corresponding Macropædia article(s), mainly because of the failure to update one or the other. [2] [5] The bibliographies of the Macropædia articles have been criticised for being more out-of-date than the articles themselves. [2] [3] [5]
In 2010 an inaccurate entry about the Irish civil war was discussed in the Irish press following a decision of the Department of Education and Science to pay for online access. [97] [98]
Speaking of the 3rd edition (1788–1797), Britannica ' s chief editor George Gleig wrote that "perfection seems to be incompatible with the nature of works constructed on such a plan, and embracing such a variety of subjects." [99] In March 2006, the Britannica wrote, "we in no way mean to imply that Britannica is error-free; we have never made such a claim." [81] The sentiment is expressed by its original editor, William Smellie :
However, Jorge Cauz (president of Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.) asserted in 2012 that " Britannica […] will always be factually correct." [1]

History
Past owners have included, in chronological order, the Edinburgh, Scotland printers Colin Macfarquhar and Andrew Bell, Scottish bookseller Archibald Constable , Scottish publisher A & C Black , Horace Everett Hooper , Sears Roebuck and William Benton .
The present owner of Encyclopædia Britannica Inc. is Jacqui Safra , a Swiss billionaire and actor. Recent advances in information technology and the rise of electronic encyclopaedias such as Encyclopædia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite , Encarta and Wikipedia have reduced the demand for print encyclopaedias. [100] To remain competitive, Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. has stressed the reputation of the Britannica , reduced its price and production costs, and developed electronic versions on CD-ROM , DVD, and the World Wide Web . Since the early 1930s, the company has promoted spin-off reference works. [10]

Editions
The Britannica has been issued in 15 editions, with multi-volume supplements to the 3rd and 4th editions (see the Table below). The 5th and 6th editions were reprints of the 4th, the 10th edition was only a supplement to the 9th, just as the 12th and 13th editions were supplements to the 11th. The 15th underwent massive re-organisation in 1985, but the updated, current version is still known as the 15th. The 14th and 15th editions were edited every year throughout their runs, so that later printings of each were entirely different from early ones.
Throughout history, the Britannica has had two aims: to be an excellent reference book, and to provide educational material. [101] In 1974, the 15th edition adopted a third goal: to systematise all human knowledge. [7] The history of the Britannica can be divided into five eras, punctuated by changes in management, or re-organisation of the dictionary.

1768–1826
In the first era (1st–6th editions, 1768–1826), the Britannica was managed and published by its founders, Colin Macfarquhar and Andrew Bell , by Archibald Constable , and by others. The Britannica was first published between 1768 and 1771 in Edinburgh as the Encyclopædia Britannica, or, A Dictionary of Arts and Sciences, compiled upon a New Plan . In part, it was conceived in reaction to the French Encyclopédie of Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d'Alembert (published 1751–72), which had been inspired by Chambers's Cyclopaedia (first edition 1728).
The Britannica of this period was primarily a Scottish enterprise, and it is one of the most enduring legacies of the Scottish Enlightenment . [102] In this era, the Britannica moved from being a three-volume set (1st edition) compiled by one young editor— William Smellie [103] —to a 20-volume set written by numerous authorities. Several other encyclopaedias competed throughout this period, among them editions of Abraham Rees 's Cyclopædia and Coleridge's Encyclopædia Metropolitana [104] and David Brewster 's Edinburgh Encyclopædia .

1827–1901
During the second era (7th–9th editions, 1827–1901), the Britannica was managed by the Edinburgh publishing firm, A & C Black . Although some contributors were again recruited through friendships of the chief editors, notably Macvey Napier , others were attracted by the Britannica's reputation. The contributors often came from other countries and included the world's most respected authorities in their fields. A general index of all articles was included for the first time in the 7th edition, a practice maintained until 1974.
Production of the 9th edition was overseen by Thomas Spencer Baynes , the first English-born editor-in-chief. Dubbed the "Scholar's Edition", the 9th edition is the most scholarly of all Britannicas . [3] [83] After 1880, Baynes was assisted by William Robertson Smith . [105] No biographies of living persons were included. [106] James Clerk Maxwell and Thomas Huxley were special advisors on science. [107] However, by the close of the 19th century, the 9th edition was outdated, and the Britannica faced financial difficulties.

1901–1973
In the third era (10th–14th editions, 1901–73), the Britannica was managed by American businessmen who introduced direct marketing and door-to-door sales. The American owners gradually simplified articles, making them less scholarly for a mass market. The 10th edition was a nine-volume supplement to the 9th, but the 11th edition was a completely new work, and is still praised for excellence; its owner, Horace Hooper , lavished enormous effort on its perfection. [83]
When Hooper fell into financial difficulties, the Britannica was managed by Sears Roebuck for 18 years (1920–23, 1928–43). In 1932, the vice-president of Sears, Elkan Harrison Powell , assumed presidency of the Britannica ; in 1936, he began the policy of continuous revision. This was a departure from earlier practice, in which the articles were not changed until a new edition was produced, at roughly 25-year intervals, some articles unchanged from earlier editions. [10] Powell developed new educational products that built upon the Britannica's reputation.
In 1943, Sears donated the Encyclopædia Britannica to the University of Chicago . William Benton , then a vice president of the University, provided the working capital for its operation. The stock was divided between Benton and the University, with the University holding an option on the stock. [108] Benton became Chairman of the Board and managed the Britannica until his death in 1973. [109] Benton set up the Benton Foundation , which managed the Britannica until 1996. In 1968, near the end of this era, the Britannica celebrated its bicentennial .

1974–1994
In the fourth era (1974–94), the Britannica introduced its 15th edition, which was re-organised into three parts: the Micropædia , the Macropædia , and the Propædia . Under Mortimer J. Adler (member of the Board of Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica since its inception in 1949, and its chair from 1974; director of editorial planning for the 15th edition of Britannica from 1965), [110] the Britannica sought not only to be a good reference work and educational tool, but to systematise all human knowledge. The absence of a separate index and the grouping of articles into parallel encyclopaedias (the Micro- and Macropædia ) provoked a "firestorm of criticism" of the initial 15th edition. [3] [94] In response, the 15th edition was completely re-organised and indexed for a re-release in 1985. This second version of the 15th edition continued to be published and revised until the 2010 print version. The official title of the 15th edition is the New Encyclopædia Britannica , although it has also been promoted as Britannica 3 . [3]
On 9 March 1976 the U.S. Federal Trade Commission entered an opinion and order enjoining Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. from using: a) deceptive advertising practices in recruiting sales agents and obtaining sales leads, and b) deceptive sales practices in the door-to-door presentations of its sales agents. [111]

1994–present
In the fifth era (1994–present), digital versions have been developed and released on optical media and online. In 1996, the Britannica was bought by Jacqui Safra at well below its estimated value, owing to the company's financial difficulties. Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. split in 1999. One part retained the company name and developed the print version, and the other, Britannica.com Inc. , developed digital versions. Since 2001, the two companies have shared a CEO, Ilan Yeshua , who has continued Powell's strategy of introducing new products with the Britannica name. In March 2012, Britannica's president, Jorge Cauz , announced that it would not produce any new print editions of the encyclopaedia, with the 2010 15th edition being the last. The company will focus only on the online edition and other educational tools. [1] [112]
Britannica ' s final print edition was in 2010, a 32-volume set. [1] Britannica Global Edition was also printed in 2010. It contained 30 volumes and 18,251 pages, with 8,500 photographs, maps, flags, and illustrations in smaller "compact" volumes. It contained over 40,000 articles written by scholars from across the world, including Nobel Prize winners. Unlike the 15th edition, it did not contain Macro- and Micropædia sections, but ran A through Z as all editions up to the 14th had. The following is Britannica ' s description of the work: [4]

Dedications
The Britannica was dedicated to the reigning British monarch from 1788 to 1901 and then, upon its sale to an American partnership, to the British monarch and the President of the United States. [3] Thus, the 11th edition is "dedicated by Permission to His Majesty George the Fifth , King of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British Dominions beyond the Seas, Emperor of India , and to William Howard Taft , President of the United States of America." [113] The order of the dedications has changed with the relative power of the United States and Britain, and with relative sales; the 1954 version of the 14th edition is "Dedicated by Permission to the Heads of the Two English-Speaking Peoples, Dwight David Eisenhower , President of the United States of America, and Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth the Second ." [69] Consistent with this tradition, the 2007 version of the current 15th edition was "dedicated by permission to the current President of the United States of America, George W. Bush , and Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II," [114] while the 2010 version of the current 15th edition is "dedicated by permission to Barack Obama , President of the United States of America, and Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II." [115]

Nupedia
Nupedia was an English-language Web-based encyclopedia whose articles were written by volunteer contributors with appropriate subject matter expertise, reviewed by expert editors before publication and licensed as free content . It was founded by Jimmy Wales and underwritten by Bomis , with Larry Sanger as editor-in-chief. Nupedia lasted from October 1999 [1] [2] until September 2003. It is mostly known now as the predecessor of Wikipedia , but Nupedia had a seven-step approval process to control content of articles before being posted, rather than live wiki -based updating. Nupedia was designed by committee, with experts to predefine the rules, and it approved only 21 articles in its first year, compared to Wikipedia posting 200 articles in the first month, and 18,000 in the first year. [3] Unlike Wikipedia, Nupedia was not a wiki ; it was instead characterized by an extensive peer-review process, designed to make its articles of a quality comparable to that of professional encyclopedias. Nupedia wanted scholars (ideally with PhDs) to volunteer content. [4] Before it ceased operating, Nupedia produced 25 approved articles [5] that had completed its review process (three articles also existed in two versions of different lengths), and 74 more articles were in progress. [ citation needed ] Jimmy Wales preferred Wikipedia's easier posting of articles, but Larry Sanger wanted to control content at Nupedia [3] and founded Citizendium instead.
In June 2008, CNET UK listed Nupedia as one of the greatest defunct websites in the still young internet history , noting how the strict control had limited the posting of articles. [6]

History
In October 1999, [7] Jimmy Wales began thinking about an online encyclopedia built by volunteers and, in January 2000, hired Larry Sanger to oversee its development. [2] The project officially went online on March 9, 2000. [8] By November 2000, however, only two full-length articles had been published. [9]
From its beginning, Nupedia was a free content encyclopedia, [8] with Bomis intending to generate revenue from online ads on Nupedia.com. [9] Initially the project used a homegrown license, the Nupedia Open Content License. In January 2001, it switched to the GNU Free Documentation License at the urging of Richard Stallman and the Free Software Foundation . [10]
Also in January 2001, Nupedia started Wikipedia as a side-project to allow collaboration on articles before entering the peer review process. [11] This attracted interest from both sides, as it provided the less bureaucratic structure favored by advocates of the GNE encyclopedia . As a result, GNE never really developed, and the threat of competition between the projects was averted. As Wikipedia grew and attracted contributors, it quickly developed a life of its own and began to function largely independently of Nupedia, although Sanger initially led activity on Wikipedia by virtue of his position as Nupedia's editor-in-chief.
Besides leading to discontinuation of the GNE project, Wikipedia also led to the gradual demise of Nupedia. Due to the collapse of the internet economy at that time, Jimmy Wales decided to discontinue funding for a salaried editor-in-chief in December 2001, [2] and Sanger resigned from both projects soon thereafter. [12] After Sanger's departure, Nupedia increasingly became an afterthought to Wikipedia; of the Nupedia articles that completed the review process, only two did so after 2001. As Nupedia dwindled into inactivity, the idea of converting it into a stable version of approved Wikipedia articles was occasionally broached, but never implemented. The Nupedia website at nupedia.com was shut down on September 26, 2003. [12] Nupedia's encyclopedic content, which was often described as limited, has since been assimilated into Wikipedia.

Editorial process
Nupedia had a seven-step editorial process, consisting of:
Authors were expected to have expert knowledge (although the definition of expert allowed for a degree of flexibility, and it was acknowledged that some articles could be written by a good writer, rather than an expert per se ) [13] and the editors approving articles for publication were expected "to be true experts in their fields and (with few exceptions) [to] possess PhDs". [14]
Ruth Ifcher was someone Sanger depended upon and worked closely with on Nupedia's early policies and procedures. Ifner, holding several higher degrees, was a computer programmer and former copy editor and agreed to be volunteer chief copy editor. [15]

Software development
Nupedia was powered by NupeCode collaborative software . NupeCode is free / open source software (released under the GNU General Public License ) designed for large peer review projects. The code was available via Nupedia's CVS repository. One of the problems experienced by Nupedia during much of its existence was that the software lacked functionality. Much of the missing functionality had been mocked-up using underlined blocks of text which appeared to be hyperlinks, but actually were not. [ citation needed ]
As part of the project, a new version of the original software (called "NuNupedia") was under development. NuNupedia was implemented for testing at SourceForge , but never reached a sufficient stage of development to replace the original software. [16]

GNU Free Documentation License
The GNU Free Documentation License ( GNU FDL or simply GFDL ) is a copyleft license for free documentation, designed by the Free Software Foundation (FSF) for the GNU Project . It is similar to the GNU General Public License , giving readers the rights to copy, redistribute, and modify (only when without "invariant sections" restrictions) a work and requires all copies and derivatives to be available under the same license. Copies may also be sold commercially, but, if produced in larger quantities (greater than 100), the original document or source code must be made available to the work's recipient.
The GFDL was designed for manuals , textbooks, other reference and instructional materials, and documentation which often accompanies GNU software. However, it can be used for any text-based work, regardless of subject matter. For example, the free online encyclopedia Wikipedia uses the GFDL (coupled with the Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike License ) for all of its text.

History
The GFDL was released in draft form for feedback in September 1999. [1] After revisions, version 1.1 was issued in March 2000, version 1.2 in November 2002, and version 1.3 in November 2008. The current state of the license is version 1.3. [2]
The first discussion draft of the GNU Free Documentation License version 2 was released on September 26, 2006, along with a draft of the new GNU Simpler Free Documentation License .
On December 1, 2007, Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales announced that a long period of discussion and negotiation between and amongst the Free Software Foundation, Creative Commons, the Wikimedia Foundation and others had produced a proposal supported by both the FSF and Creative Commons to modify the Free Documentation License in such a fashion as to allow the possibility for the Wikimedia Foundation to migrate the projects to the similar Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike (CC BY-SA) license. [3] [4] These changes were implemented on version 1.3 of the license, which includes a new provision allowing certain materials released under the license to be used under a Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike license also. [2]

Conditions
Material licensed under the current version of the license can be used for any purpose, as long as the use meets certain conditions.

Secondary sections
The license explicitly separates any kind of "Document" from "Secondary Sections", which may not be integrated with the Document, but exist as front-matter materials or appendices. Secondary sections can contain information regarding the author's or publisher's relationship to the subject matter, but not any subject matter itself. While the Document itself is wholly editable, and is essentially covered by a license equivalent to (but mutually incompatible with) the GNU General Public License , some of the secondary sections have various restrictions designed primarily to deal with proper attribution to previous authors.
Specifically, the authors of prior versions have to be acknowledged and certain "invariant sections" specified by the original author and dealing with his or her relationship to the subject matter may not be changed. If the material is modified, its title has to be changed (unless the prior authors give permission to retain the title).
The license also has provisions for the handling of front-cover and back-cover texts of books, as well as for "History", "Acknowledgements", "Dedications" and "Endorsements" sections. These features were added in part to make the license more financially attractive to commercial publishers of software documentation, some of whom were consulted during the drafting of the GFDL. [5] [6] "Endorsements" sections are intended to be used in official standard documents, where distribution of modified versions should only be permitted if they are not labeled as that standard any more. [6]

Commercial redistribution
The GFDL requires the ability to "copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially" and therefore is incompatible with material that excludes commercial re-use. As mentioned above, the GFDL was designed with commercial publishers in mind, as Stallman explained:
Material that restricts commercial re-use is incompatible with the license and cannot be incorporated into the work. However, incorporating such restricted material may be fair use under United States copyright law (or fair dealing in some other countries) and does not need to be licensed to fall within the GFDL if such fair use is covered by all potential subsequent uses. One example of such liberal and commercial fair use is parody .

Compatibility with Creative Commons licensing terms
Although the two licenses work on similar copyleft principles, the GFDL is not compatible with the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license.
However, at the request of the Wikimedia Foundation , [2] version 1.3 added a time-limited section allowing specific types of websites using the GFDL to additionally offer their work under the CC BY-SA license. These exemptions allow a GFDL-based collaborative project with multiple authors to transition to the CC BY-SA 3.0 license, without first obtaining the permission of every author, if the work satisfies several conditions: [2]
To prevent the clause from being used as a general compatibility measure, the license itself only allowed the change to occur before August 1, 2009. At the release of version 1.3, the FSF stated that all content added before November 1, 2008 to Wikipedia as an example satisfied the conditions. The Wikimedia Foundation itself after a public referendum, invoked this process to dual-license content released under the GFDL under the CC BY-SA license in June 2009, and adopted a foundation-wide attribution policy for the use of content from Wikimedia Foundation projects. [7] [8] [9]

Enforcement
There have currently been no cases involving the GFDL in a court of law, although its sister license for software, the GNU General Public License , has been successfully enforced in such a setting. [10] Although the content of Wikipedia has been plagiarized and used in violation of the GFDL by other sites, such as Baidu Baike , no contributors have ever tried to bring an organization to court due to violation of the GFDL. In the case of Baidu, Wikipedia representatives asked the site and its contributors to respect the terms of the licenses and to make proper attributions. [11]

Criticism
Some critics consider the GFDL a non-free license. Some reasons for this are that the GFDL allows "invariant" text which cannot be modified or removed, and that its prohibition against digital rights management (DRM) systems applies to valid usages, like for "private copies made and not distributed". [12]
Notably, the Debian project, [13] Thomas Bushnell , [14] Nathanael Nerode, [15] and Bruce Perens [16] have raised objections. Bruce Perens saw the GFDL even outside the "Free Software ethos": [16]
In 2006, Debian developers voted to consider works licensed under the GFDL to comply with their Debian Free Software Guidelines provided the invariant section clauses are not used. [17] The results was GFDL without invariant sections is DFSG compliant. [17] However, their resolution stated that even without invariant sections, GFDL-licensed software documentation "is still not free of trouble", namely because of its incompatibility with the major free software licenses. [17]
Those opposed to the GFDL have recommended the use of alternative licenses such as the BSD Documentation License or the GNU GPL. [17]
The FLOSS Manuals foundation, an organization devoted to creating manuals for free software, decided to eschew the GFDL in favor of the GPL for its texts in 2007, citing the incompatibility between the two, difficulties in implementing the GFDL, and the fact that the GFDL "does not allow for easy duplication and modification", especially for digital documentation. [18]

DRM clause
The GNU FDL contains the statement:
A criticism of this language is that it is too broad, because it applies to private copies made but not distributed. This means that a licensee is not allowed to save document copies "made" in a proprietary file format or using encryption.
In 2003, Richard Stallman said about the above sentence on the debian-legal mailing list: [19]

Invariant sections
A GNU FDL work can quickly be encumbered because a new, different title must be given and a list of previous titles must be kept. This could lead to the situation where there are a whole series of title pages, and dedications, in each and every copy of the book if it has a long lineage. These pages cannot be removed until the work enters the public domain after copyright expires.
Richard Stallman said about invariant sections on the debian-legal mailing list: [20]

GPL incompatible in both directions
The GNU FDL is incompatible in both directions with the GPL—material under the GNU FDL cannot be put into GPL code and GPL code cannot be put into a GNU FDL manual. [21] At the June 22nd and 23rd 2006 international GPLv3 conference in Barcelona, Eben Moglen hinted that a future version of the GPL could be made suitable for documentation: [22]

Burdens when printing
The GNU FDL requires that licensees, when printing a document covered by the license, must also include "this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document". This means that if a licensee prints out a copy of an article whose text is covered under the GNU FDL, he or she must also include a copyright notice and a physical printout of the GNU FDL, which is a significantly large document in itself. Worse, the same is required for the standalone use of just one (for example, Wikipedia) image. [23] Wikivoyage , a web site dedicated to free content travel guides, chose not to use the GFDL because it considers it unsuitable for short printed texts. [24]

Other free content licenses
Some of these were developed independently of the GNU FDL, while others were developed in response to perceived flaws in the GNU FDL.

Slashdot
Slashdot (sometimes abbreviated as /. ) is a social news website that originally billed itself as "News for Nerds. Stuff that Matters". It features news stories on science and technology that are submitted and evaluated by site users. Each story has a comments section attached to it where users can add online comments. The website was founded in 1997 by Hope College students Rob Malda , also known as "CmdrTaco", and classmate Jeff Bates , also known as "Hemos". In 2012, it was acquired [4] by DHI Group, Inc. (i.e., Dice Holdings International, which created the Dice.com website for tech job seekers [5] [6] ). In January, 2016, BizX acquired Slashdot Media, including both slashdot.org and SourceForge . [1] [7] [8]
Summaries of stories and links to news articles are submitted by Slashdot's own users, and each story becomes the topic of a threaded discussion among users. Discussion is moderated by a user-based moderation system. Randomly selected moderators are assigned points (typically 5) which they can use to rate a comment. Moderation applies either −1 or +1 to the current rating, based on whether the comment is perceived as either "normal", "offtopic", "insightful", "redundant", "interesting", or " troll " (among others).
The site's comment and moderation system is administered by its own open source content management system , Slash , which is available under the GNU General Public License . In 2012, Slashdot had around 3.7 million unique visitors per month and received over 5300 comments per day. [5] The site has won more than 20 awards, including People's Voice Awards in 2000 for "Best Community Site" and "Best News Site". Occasionally, a news story posted to the site will link to a server causing a large surge of web traffic, which can overwhelm some smaller or independent sites. This phenomenon is known as the " Slashdot effect ".

History

1990s
Slashdot was preceded by Rob Malda 's personal website "Chips & Dips", which, launched in October 1997, [9] featured a single "rant" each day about something that interested its author – typically something to do with Linux or open source software. At the time, Malda was a student at Hope College in Holland, Michigan , majoring in computer science. The site became "Slashdot" in September 1997 under the slogan "News for Nerds. Stuff that Matters," and quickly became a hotspot on the Internet for news and information of interest to computer geeks. [10] The name "Slashdot" came from a somewhat "obnoxious parody of a URL " – when Malda registered the domain, he desired to make a name that was "silly and unpronounceable" – try pronouncing out, "h-t-t-p-colon-slash-slash-slashdot-dot-org". [11] By June 1998, the site was seeing as many as 100,000 page views per day and advertisers began to take notice. [10] Slashdot was co-founded by Rob Malda and Jeff Bates . By December 1998, Slashdot had net revenues of $18,000, yet its Internet profile was higher, and revenues were expected to increase.
On June 29, 1999, the site was sold to Linux megasite Andover.net for $1.5 million in cash and $7 million in Andover stock at the Initial public offering (IPO) price. Part of the deal was contingent upon the continued employment of Malda and Bates and on the achievement of certain "milestones". With the acquisition of Slashdot, Andover.net could now advertise itself as "the leading Linux/Open Source destination on the Internet". [12] [13] Andover.net merged with VA Linux on February 3, 2000, [14] which changed its name to SourceForge, Inc. on May 24, 2007, and became Geeknet, Inc. on November 4, 2009. [15]

2000s
Slashdot's 10,000th article was posted after two and a half years on February 24, 2000, [16] and the 100,000th article was posted on December 11, 2009 after 12 years online. [17] During the first 12 years, the most active story with the most responses posted was the post- 2004 US Presidential Election article "Kerry Concedes Election To Bush" with 5,687 posts. This followed the creation of a new article section, politics.slashdot.org , created at the start of the 2004 election on September 7, 2004. [18] Many of the most popular stories are political, with "Strike on Iraq" (March 19, 2003) the second-most-active article and "Barack Obama Wins US Presidency" (November 5, 2008) the third-most-active. The rest of the 10 most active articles are an article announcing the 2005 London bombings , and several articles about Evolution vs. Intelligent Design , Saddam Hussein 's capture, and Fahrenheit 9/11 . Articles about Microsoft and its Windows Operating System are popular. A thread posted in 2002 titled "What's Keeping You On Windows?" was the 10th-most-active story, and an article about Windows 2000/NT4 source-code leaks the most visited article with more than 680,000 hits. [19] Some controversy erupted on March 9, 2001 after an anonymous user posted the full text of Scientology 's "Operating Thetan Level Three" (OT III) document in a comment attached to a Slashdot article. The Church of Scientology demanded that Slashdot remove the document under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act . A week later, in a long article, Slashdot editors explained their decision to remove the page while providing links and information on how to get the document from other sources. [20]
Slashdot Japan was launched on May 28, 2001 (although the first article was published April 5, 2001) and is an official offshoot of the US-based Web site. As of January 2010 [update] the site was owned by OSDN-Japan, Inc., and carried some of the US-based Slashdot articles as well as localized stories. [21] [22] An external site, New Media Services , has reported the importance of Online Moderation last December 1, 2011. [23] On Valentine's Day 2002, founder Rob Malda proposed to longtime girlfriend Kathleen Fent using the front page of Slashdot. [24] [25] They were married on December 8, 2002, in Las Vegas , Nevada . [26] Slashdot implemented a paid subscription service on March 1, 2002. Slashdot's subscription model works by allowing users to pay a small fee to be able to view pages without banner ads , starting at a rate of $5 per 1,000 page views – non-subscribers may still view articles and respond to comments, with banner ads in place. [27] On March 6, 2003, subscribers were given the ability to see articles 10 to 20 minutes before they are released to the public. [28] Slashdot altered its threaded discussion forum display software to explicitly show domains for links in articles, as "users made a sport out of tricking unsuspecting readers into visiting [ Goatse.cx ]." [29]
In observance of April Fools' Day in 2006, Slashdot temporarily changed its signature teal color theme to a warm palette of bubblegum pink and changed its masthead from the usual, "News for Nerds" motto to, "OMG!!! Ponies!!!" Editors joked that this was done to increase female readership. [30] In another supposed April Fools' Day joke, User Achievement tags were introduced on April 1, 2009. [31] This system allowed users to be tagged with various achievements, such as "The Tagger" for tagging a story or "Member of the {1,2,3,4,5} Digit UID Club" for having a Slashdot UID consisting of a certain number of digits. While it was posted on April Fools' Day to allow for certain joke achievements, the system is real. [32] Slashdot unveiled its newly redesigned site on June 4, 2006, following a CSS Redesign Competition. The winner of the competition was Alex Bendiken, who built on the initial CSS framework of the site. The new site looks similar to the old one but is more polished with more rounded curves, collapsible menus, and updated fonts. [33] On November 9 that same year, Malda wrote that Slashdot attained 16,777,215 (or 2 24 − 1) comments, which broke the database for three hours until the administrators fixed the issue. [34]

2011
On January 25, 2011, the site launched its third major redesign in its 13.5-year history, which gutted the HTML and CSS , and updated the graphics. [35] On August 25, 2011, Malda resigned as Editor-in-Chief with immediate effect. He did not mention any plans for the future, other than spending more time with his family, catching up on some reading, and possibly writing a book. [36] [37] His final farewell message received over 1,400 comments within 24 hours on the site. [38] On December 7, 2011, Slashdot announced that it would start to push what the company described as "sponsored" Ask Slashdot questions. [39] On March 28, 2012, Slashdot launched Slashdot TV. [40] Two months later, in May 2012, Slashdot launched SlashBI, SlashCloud, and SlashDataCenter, three Websites dedicated to original journalistic content. The Websites proved controversial, with longtime Slashdot users commenting that the original content ran counter to the Website's longtime focus on user-generated submissions. [41] Nick Kolakowski, the editor of the three Websites, told The Next Web that the Websites were “meant to complement Slashdot with an added layer of insight into a very specific area of technology, without interfering with Slashdot’s longtime focus on tech-community interaction and discussion.” Despite the debate, articles published on SlashCloud and SlashBI attracted attention from io9, [42] NPR, [43] Nieman Lab, [44] Vanity Fair, and other publications.
In September 2012, Slashdot, SourceForge , and Freecode were acquired by online job site Dice.com for $20 million, and incorporated into a subsidiary known as Slashdot Media. [5] [6] While initially stating that there were no plans for major changes to Slashdot, [6] in October 2013, Slashdot launched a "beta" for a significant redesign of the site, which featured a simpler appearance and commenting system. [45] [46] While initially an opt-in beta, the site automatically began migrating selected users to the new design in February 2014; the rollout led to a negative response from many longtime users, upset by the added visual complexity, and the removal of features, such as comment viewing, that distinguished Slashdot from other news sites. An organized boycott of the site was held from February 10 to 17, 2014. [45] The "beta" site was eventually shelved. In July 2015, Dice announced that it planned to sell Slashdot and SourceForge; in particular, the company stated in a filing that it was unable to "successfully [leverage] the Slashdot user base to further Dice's digital recruitment business". [47]
On January 27, 2016, the two sites were sold to the San Diego-based BizX, LLC for an undisclosed amount. [8] [47] [48]

Administration

Team
It was run by its founder, Rob "CmdrTaco" Malda , from 1998 until 2011. He shared editorial responsibilities with several other editors including Timothy Lord, Patrick "Scuttlemonkey" McGarry, Jeff "Soulskill" Boehm, Rob "Samzenpus" Rozeboom, and Keith Dawson. [49] [50] Jonathan "cowboyneal" Pater is another popular editor of Slashdot, who came to work for Slashdot as a programmer and systems administrator. His online nickname (handle), CowboyNeal, is inspired by a Grateful Dead tribute to Neal Cassady in their song, "That's It for the Other One". He is best known as the target of the usual comic poll option, [51] a tradition started by Chris DiBona . [52]

Software
Slashdot runs on Slash , a content management system available under the GNU General Public License . [53] Early versions of Slash were written by Rob Malda , co-founder of Slashdot, in the spring of 1998. After Andover.net bought Slashdot in June 1999, [54] several programmers were hired to structure the code and render it scalable, as its users had increased from a few hundred to tens of thousands. This work was done by Brian Aker, Patrick Galbraith and Chris Nandor, resulting in version 2 of the software, released in 2001. Slash remains Free software and anyone can contribute to development.

Peer moderation
Slashdot's editors are primarily responsible for selecting and editing the primary stories that are posted daily by submitters. The editors provide a one-paragraph summary for each story and a link to an external website where the story originated. Each story becomes the topic for a threaded discussion among the site's users. [55] A user-based moderation system is employed to filter out abusive or offensive comments. [56] Every comment is initially given a score of −1 to +2 , with a default score of +1 for registered users, 0 for anonymous users ( Anonymous Coward ), +2 for users with high "karma", or −1 for users with low "karma". As moderators read comments attached to articles, they click to moderate the comment, either up ( +1 ) or down ( −1 ). Moderators may choose to attach a particular descriptor to the comments as well, such as "normal", "offtopic", " flamebait ", " troll ", "redundant", "insightful", "interesting", "informative", "funny", "overrated", or "underrated", with each corresponding to a −1 or +1 rating. So a comment may be seen to have a rating of "+1 insightful" or "−1 troll". [50] Comments are very rarely deleted, even if they contain hateful remarks. [57] [58]
Moderation points add to a user's rating, which is known as " karma " on Slashdot. Users with high "karma" are eligible to become moderators themselves. The system does not promote regular users as "moderators" and instead assigns five moderation points at a time to users based on the number of comments they have entered in the system – once a user's moderation points are used up, they can no longer moderate articles (though they can be assigned more moderation points at a later date). Paid staff editors have an unlimited number of moderation points. [50] [55] [59] A given comment can have any integer score from −1 to +5 , and registered users of Slashdot can set a personal threshold so that no comments with a lesser score are displayed. [55] [59] For instance, a user reading Slashdot at level +5 will only see the highest rated comments, while a user reading at level −1 will see a more "unfiltered, anarchic version". [50] A meta-moderation system was implemented on September 7, 1999, [60] to moderate the moderators and help contain abuses in the moderation system. [61] [ unreliable source? ] [ page needed ] Meta-moderators are presented with a set of moderations that they may rate as either fair or unfair . For each moderation, the meta-moderator sees the original comment and the reason assigned by the moderator (e.g. troll , funny ), and the meta-moderator can click to see the context of comments surrounding the one that was moderated. [55] [59]

Features
Slashdot features discussion forums on a variety of technology- and science-related topics, or "News for Nerds", as its motto states. Articles are divided into the following sections: [62]

Tags
Slashdot uses a system of "tags" where users can categorize a story to group them together and sorting them. Tags are written in all lowercase, with no spaces, and limited to 64 characters. For example, articles could be tagged as being about "security" or "mozilla". Some articles are tagged with longer tags, such as "whatcouldpossiblygowrong" (expressing the perception of catastrophic risk), "suddenoutbreakofcommonsense" (used when the community feels that the subject has finally figured out something obvious), "correlationnotcausation" (used when scientific articles lack direct evidence; see correlation does not imply causation ), or "getyourasstomars" (commonly seen in articles about Mars or space exploration ). [64] [65]

Culture
As an online community with primarily user-generated content, many in-jokes and internet memes have developed over the course of the site's history. A popular meme (based on an unscientific Slashdot user poll [66] ) is, "In Soviet Russia, noun verb you!" [67] This type of joke has its roots in the 1960s or earlier, and is known as a " Russian reversal ". Other popular memes usually pertain to computing or technology, such as "Imagine a Beowulf cluster of these", [68] "But does it run Linux?", [69] or " Netcraft now confirms: BSD (or some other software package or item) is dying." [70] Users will also typically refer to articles referring to data storage and data capacity by inquiring how much it is in units of Libraries of Congress . [71] Sometimes bandwidth speeds are referred to in units of Libraries of Congress per second. When numbers are quoted, people will comment that the number happens to be the "combination to their luggage" (a reference to the Mel Brooks film Spaceballs ) and express false anger at the person who revealed it.
Slashdotters often use the abbreviation TFA which stands for The fucking article or RTFA ("Read the fucking article"), which itself is derived from the abbreviation RTFM . [72] Usage of this abbreviation often exposes comments from posters who have not read the article linked to in the main story. Slashdotters typically like to mock United States Senator Ted Stevens ' 2006 description of the Internet as a " series of tubes " [73] [74] or Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer 's chair-throwing incident from 2005. [75] [76] Microsoft founder Bill Gates is a popular target of jokes by Slashdotters, and all stories about Microsoft were once identified with a graphic of Gates looking like a Borg from Star Trek: The Next Generation . [77] Many Slashdotters have long talked about the supposed release of Duke Nukem Forever , which was promised in 1997 but was delayed indefinitely (the game was eventually released in 2011). [78] References to the game are commonly brought up in other articles about software packages that are not yet in production even though the announced delivery date has long passed (see vaporware ). Having a low Slashdot user identifier (user ID) is highly valued since they are assigned sequentially; having one is a sign that someone has an older account and has contributed to the site longer. For Slashdot's 10-year anniversary in 2007, one of the items auctioned off in the charity auction for the Electronic Frontier Foundation was a 3-digit Slashdot user ID. [32] [79]

Traffic and publicity
As of 2006, Slashdot had approximately 5.5 million users per month. As of January 2013, the site's Alexa rank is 2,000, with the average user spending 3 minutes and 18 seconds per day on the site and 82,665 sites linking in.

[80] [81] There has been a dip in readership as of 2011, primarily due to the increase of technology-related blogs and Twitter feeds. [82] In 2002, approximately 50% of Slashdot's traffic consisted of people who simply check out the headlines and click through, while others participate in discussion boards and take part in the community. [83] Many links in Slashdot stories caused the linked site to get swamped by heavy traffic and its server to collapse. This is known as the "Slashdot effect", [80] [83] a term which was first coined on February 15, 1999 that refers to an article about a "new generation of niche Web portals driving unprecedented amounts of traffic to sites of interest". [81] [84] Today, most major websites can handle the surge of traffic, but the effect continues to occur on smaller or independent sites. [85] These sites are then said to have been "Slashdotted".
Slashdot has received over twenty awards, including People's Voice Awards in 2000 in both of the categories for which it was nominated ( Best Community Site and Best News Site ).

Fork (software development)
In software engineering , a project fork happens when developers take a copy of source code from one software package and start independent development on it, creating a distinct and separate piece of software. The term often implies not merely a development branch , but also a split in the developer community, a form of schism . [1]
Free and open-source software is that which, by definition, may be forked from the original development team without prior permission, without violating copyright law. However, licensed forks of proprietary software ( e.g. Unix ) also happen.

Etymology
The word fork stems from the Latin word furca, meaning a "fork or similarly shaped instrument." [2] "Fork" in the meaning of "to divide in branches, go separate ways" has been used as early as the 14th century. [3] In the software environment, the word evokes the fork system call, which causes a running process to split itself into two (almost) identical copies that (typically) diverge to perform different tasks. [4]
In the context of software development, "fork" was used in the sense of creating a revision control " branch " by Eric Allman as early as 1980, in the context of SCCS : [5]
The term was in use on Usenet by 1983 for the process of creating a subgroup to move topics of discussion to. [6]
"Fork" is not known to have been used in the sense of a community schism during the origins of Lucid Emacs (now XEmacs ) (1991) or the BSDs (1993–1994); Russ Nelson used the term "shattering" for this sort of fork in 1993, attributing it to John Gilmore . [7] However, "fork" was in use in the present sense by 1995 to describe the XEmacs split, [8] and was an understood usage in the GNU Project by 1996. [9]

Forking of free and open source software
Free and open source software may be legally forked without prior approval of those currently developing, managing, or distributing the software per both The Free Software Definition and The Open Source Definition : [10]
In free software, forks often result from a schism over different goals or personality clashes. In a fork, both parties assume nearly identical code bases, but typically only the larger group, or whoever controls the Web site, will retain the full original name and the associated user community. Thus, there is a reputation penalty associated with forking. [10] The relationship between the different teams can be cordial or very bitter.
Eric S. Raymond , in his essay Homesteading the Noosphere , [13] stated that "The most important characteristic of a fork is that it spawns competing projects that cannot later exchange code, splitting the potential developer community". He notes in the Jargon File :
David A. Wheeler notes [10] four possible outcomes of a fork, with examples:
Distributed revision control (DVCS) tools have popularised a less emotive use of the term "fork", blurring the distinction with "branch". [15] With a DVCS such as Mercurial or Git , the normal way to contribute to a project, is to first create a personal branch of the repository, independent of the main repository, and later seek to have your changes integrated with it. Sites such as GitHub , Bitbucket and Launchpad provide free DVCS hosting expressly supporting independent branches, such that the technical, social and financial barriers to forking a source code repository are massively reduced, and GitHub uses "fork" as its term for this method of contribution to a project.
Forks often restart version numbering from 0.1 or 1.0 even if the original software was at version 3.0, 4.0, or 5.0. An exception is when the forked software is designed to be a drop-in replacement for the original project, e.g. MariaDB for MySQL [16] or LibreOffice for OpenOffice.org .

Forking proprietary software
In proprietary software , the copyright is usually held by the employing entity, not by the individual software developers. Proprietary code is thus more commonly forked when the owner needs to develop two or more versions, such as a windowed version and a command line version, or versions for differing operating systems, such as a word processor for IBM PC compatible machines and Macintosh computers. Generally, such internal forks will concentrate on having the same look, feel, data format, and behavior between platforms so that a user familiar with one can also be productive or share documents generated on the other. This is almost always an economic decision to generate a greater market share and thus pay back the associated extra development costs created by the fork.
A notable proprietary fork not of this kind is the many varieties of proprietary Unix —almost all derived from AT&T Unix under license and all called "Unix", but increasingly mutually incompatible. [17] See UNIX wars .
The BSD licenses permit forks to become proprietary software, and some say [ who? ] that commercial incentives thus make proprietisation almost inevitable. Examples include macOS (based on the proprietary NeXTSTEP and the open source FreeBSD ), Cedega and CrossOver (proprietary forks of Wine , though CrossOver tracks Wine and contributes considerably), EnterpriseDB (a fork of PostgreSQL , adding Oracle compatibility features [18] ), Supported PostgreSQL with their proprietary ESM storage system, [19] and Netezza's [20] proprietary highly scalable derivative of PostgreSQL. Some of these vendors contribute back changes to the community project, while some keep their changes as their own competitive advantages.

Spain
Coordinates : 40°N 4°W ﻿ / ﻿ 40°N 4°W ﻿ / 40; -4
Spain ( Spanish : España [esˈpaɲa] ( listen ) ), officially the Kingdom of Spain (Spanish: Reino de España ), [a] [b] is a sovereign state located on the Iberian Peninsula in southwestern Europe , with two large archipelagoes , the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea and the Canary Islands off the North African Atlantic coast, two cities Ceuta and Melilla in the North African mainland and several small islands in the Alboran Sea near the Moroccan coast. Its mainland is bordered to the south and east by the Mediterranean Sea except for a small land boundary with Gibraltar ; to the north and northeast by France, Andorra , and the Bay of Biscay ; and to the west and northwest by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean. It is the only European country to have a border with an African country (Morocco) [h] and its African territory accounts for nearly 5% of its population, mostly in the Canary Islands but also in Ceuta and Melilla.
With an area of 505,990 km 2 (195,360 sq mi), Spain is the largest country in Southern Europe, the second largest country in Western Europe and the European Union, and the fourth largest country in the European continent . By population, Spain is the sixth largest in Europe and the fifth in the European Union. Spain's capital and largest city is Madrid ; other major urban areas include Barcelona , Valencia , Seville , Bilbao and Málaga .
Modern humans first arrived in the Iberian Peninsula around 35,000 years ago. Iberian cultures along with ancient Phoenician , Greek and Carthaginian settlements developed on the peninsula until it came under Roman rule around 200 BCE, after which the region was named Hispania , based on the earlier Phoenician name Span or Spania . [10] In the Middle Ages, the area was conquered by Germanic tribes and later by the Moors . Spain emerged as a unified country in the 15th century, following the marriage of the Catholic Monarchs and the completion of the eight centuries-long reconquest, or Reconquista from the Moors in 1492. In the early modern period, Spain became one of history's first global colonial empires , leaving a vast cultural and linguistic legacy that includes over 500 million Spanish speakers , making Spanish the world's second most spoken first language , after Mandarin Chinese.
Spain is a democracy organised in the form of a parliamentary government under a constitutional monarchy . It is a middle power and a major developed country [11] with the world's fourteenth largest economy by nominal GDP and sixteenth largest by purchasing power parity . It is a member of the United Nations (UN), the European Union (EU), the Eurozone , the Council of Europe (CoE), the Organization of Ibero-American States (OEI), the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) , the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the World Trade Organization (WTO) and many other international organisations.

Etymology
The origins of the Roman name Hispania , from which the modern name España was derived, are uncertain due to inadequate evidence, although it is documented that the Phoenicians and Carthaginians referred to the region as Spania , therefore the most widely accepted etymology is a Semitic-Phoenician one. [10] [12] Down the centuries there have been a number of accounts and hypotheses:
The Renaissance scholar Antonio de Nebrija proposed that the word Hispania evolved from the Iberian word Hispalis , meaning "city of the western world".
Jesús Luis Cunchillos argues that the root of the term span is the Phoenician word spy , meaning "to forge metals". Therefore, i-spn-ya would mean "the land where metals are forged". [13] It may be a derivation of the Phoenician I-Shpania , meaning "island of rabbits", "land of rabbits" or "edge", a reference to Spain's location at the end of the Mediterranean; Roman coins struck in the region from the reign of Hadrian show a female figure with a rabbit at her feet, [14] and Strabo called it the "land of the rabbits". [15]
Hispania may derive from the poetic use of the term Hesperia , reflecting the Greek perception of Italy as a "western land" or "land of the setting sun" ( Hesperia , Ἑσπερία in Greek ) and Spain, being still further west, as Hesperia ultima . [16]
There is the claim that "Hispania" derives from the Basque word Ezpanna meaning "edge" or "border", another reference to the fact that the Iberian Peninsula constitutes the southwest corner of the European continent. [16]
Two 15th-century Spanish Jewish scholars, Don Isaac Abravanel and Solomon ibn Verga , gave an explanation now considered folkloric. Both men wrote in two different published works that the first Jews to reach Spain were brought by ship by Phiros who was confederate with the king of Babylon when he laid siege to Jerusalem. This man was a Grecian by birth, but who had been given a kingdom in Spain. He became related by marriage to Espan, the nephew of king Heracles, who also ruled over a kingdom in Spain. Heracles later renounced his throne in preference for his native Greece, leaving his kingdom to his nephew, Espan, from whom the country of España (Spain) took its name. Based upon their testimonies, this eponym would have already been in use in Spain by c. 350 BCE. [17]

History
Iberia enters written records as a land populated largely by the Iberians , Basques and Celts . Early on its coastal areas were settled by Phoenicians who founded Western Europe's most ancient cities Cadiz and Malaga . Phoenician influence expanded as much of the Peninsula was eventually incorporated into the Carthaginian Empire , becoming a major theater of the Punic Wars against the expanding Roman Empire . After an arduous conquest , the peninsula came fully under Roman Rule. During the early Middle Ages it came under Germanic rule but later, much of it was conquered by Moorish invaders from North Africa. In a process that took centuries, the small Christian kingdoms in the north gradually regained control of the peninsula. The last Moorish kingdom fell in the same year Columbus reached the Americas. A global empire began which saw Spain become the strongest kingdom in Europe, the leading world power for a century and a half, and the largest overseas empire for three centuries.
Continued wars and other problems eventually led to a diminished status. The Napoleonic invasions of Spain led to chaos, triggering independence movements that tore apart most of the empire and left the country politically unstable. Prior to the Second World War, Spain suffered a devastating civil war and came under the rule of an authoritarian government, which oversaw a period of stagnation that was followed by a surge in the growth of the economy. Eventually democracy was peacefully restored in the form of a parliamentary constitutional monarchy. Spain joined the European Union, experiencing a cultural renaissance and steady economic growth until the beginning of the 21st century, that started a new globalized world with economic and ecological challenges.

Prehistory and pre-Roman peoples
Archaeological research at Atapuerca indicates the Iberian Peninsula was populated by hominids 1.2 million years ago. [19] In Atapuerca fossils have been found of the earliest known hominins in Europe , the Homo antecessor . Modern humans first arrived in Iberia, from the north on foot, about 35,000 years ago. [20] [ not in citation given ] The best known artefacts of these prehistoric human settlements are the famous paintings in the Altamira cave of Cantabria in northern Iberia, which were created from 35,600 to 13,500 BCE by Cro-Magnon . [18] [21] Archaeological and genetic evidence suggests that the Iberian Peninsula acted as one of several major refugia from which northern Europe was repopulated following the end of the last ice age .
The largest groups inhabiting the Iberian Peninsula before the Roman conquest were the Iberians and the Celts . The Iberians inhabited the Mediterranean side of the peninsula, from the northeast to the southeast. The Celts inhabited much of the inner and Atlantic sides of the peninsula, from the northwest to the southwest. Basques occupied the western area of the Pyrenees mountain range and adjacent areas, the Phoenician-influenced Tartessians culture flourished in the southwest and the Lusitanians and Vettones occupied areas in the central west. A number of cities were founded along the coast by Phoenicians , and trading outposts were established by Greeks in the North East. Eventually, Phoenician- Carthaginians expanded inland conquering about over half of modern-day Spain.

Roman Empire and the Gothic Kingdom
During the Second Punic War , roughly between 210 and 205 BC the expanding Roman Republic captured Carthaginian trading colonies along the Mediterranean coast. Although it took the Romans nearly two centuries to complete the conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, they retained control of it for over six centuries. Roman rule was bound together by law, language, and the Roman road . [22]
The cultures of the Celtic and Iberian populations were gradually Romanised (Latinised) at different rates depending on what part of Hispania they lived in, with local leaders being admitted into the Roman aristocratic class. [i] [23] Hispania served as a granary for the Roman market, and its harbors exported gold , wool , olive oil , and wine . Agricultural production increased with the introduction of irrigation projects, some of which remain in use. Emperors Hadrian , Trajan , Theodosius I , and the philosopher Seneca were born in Hispania. [j] Christianity was introduced into Hispania in the 1st century AD and it became popular in the cities in the 2nd century AD. [23] Most of Spain's present languages and religion, and the basis of its laws, originate from this period. [22]
The weakening of the Western Roman Empire's jurisdiction in Hispania began in 409, when the Germanic Suebi and Vandals , together with the Sarmatian Alans , crossed the Rhine and ravaged Gaul until the Visigoths drove them back into Iberia that same year. The Suebi established a kingdom in what is today modern Galicia and northern Portugal whereas the Vandals briefly established themselves in southern Spain before crossing over to North Africa and conquering Carthage. As the western empire disintegrated, the social and economic base became greatly simplified: but even in modified form, the successor regimes maintained many of the institutions and laws of the late empire, including Christianity and assimilation to the evolving Roman culture.
The Byzantines established an occidental province, Spania , in the south, with the intention of reviving Roman rule throughout Iberia. Eventually, however, Hispania was reunited under Visigothic rule .
Isidore of Seville , born in Murcia , Archbishop of Seville , was an influential cleric and philosopher and was much studied in the Middle Ages in Europe . His theories were also vital to the conversion of the Visigothic Kingdom from an Arian domain to a Catholic one in the Councils of Toledo . This Gothic kingdom was the first independent Christian kingdom ruling in the Iberian Peninsula , and in the Reconquista it was the referent for the different kingdoms fighting against the Muslim rule.

Middle Ages: Muslim era and Reconquista
In the 8th century, nearly all of the Iberian Peninsula was conquered (711–718) by largely Moorish Muslim armies from North Africa. These conquests were part of the expansion of the Umayyad Caliphate . Only a small area in the mountainous north-west of the peninsula managed to resist the initial invasion.
Under Islamic law , Christians and Jews were given the subordinate status of dhimmi . This status permitted Christians and Jews to practice their religions as People of the Book but they were required to pay a special tax and had legal and social rights inferior to those of Muslims. [24] [25]
Conversion to Islam proceeded at an increasing pace. The muladíes (Muslims of ethnic Iberian origin) are believed to have comprised the majority of the population of Al-Andalus by the end of the 10th century. [26] [27]
The Muslim community in the Iberian Peninsula was itself diverse and beset by social tensions. The Berber people of North Africa, who had provided the bulk of the invading armies, clashed with the Arab leadership from the Middle East . [k] Over time, large Moorish populations became established, especially in the Guadalquivir River valley, the coastal plain of Valencia , the Ebro River valley and (towards the end of this period) in the mountainous region of Granada . [27]
Córdoba , the capital of the caliphate since Abd-ar-Rahman III , was the largest, richest and most sophisticated city in western Europe. Mediterranean trade and cultural exchange flourished. Muslims imported a rich intellectual tradition from the Middle East and North Africa. Muslim and Jewish scholars played an important part in reviving and expanding classical Greek learning in Western Europe. Some important philosophers at the time were Averroes , Ibn Arabi and Maimonides . The Romanised cultures of the Iberian Peninsula interacted with Muslim and Jewish cultures in complex ways, giving the region a distinctive culture. [27] Outside the cities, where the vast majority lived, the land ownership system from Roman times remained largely intact as Muslim leaders rarely dispossessed landowners and the introduction of new crops and techniques led to an expansion of agriculture.
In the 11th century, the Muslim holdings fractured into rival Taifa kingdoms, allowing the small Christian states the opportunity to greatly enlarge their territories. [27] The arrival from North Africa of the Islamic ruling sects of the Almoravids and the Almohads restored unity upon the Muslim holdings, with a stricter, less tolerant application of Islam, and saw a revival in Muslim fortunes. This re-united Islamic state experienced more than a century of successes that partially reversed Christian gains.
The Reconquista (Reconquest) was the centuries-long period in which Christian rule was re-established over the Iberian Peninsula. The Reconquista is viewed as beginning with the Battle of Covadonga won by Don Pelayo in 722 and was concurrent with the period of Muslim rule on the Iberian Peninsula. The Christian army's victory over Muslim forces led to the creation of the Christian Kingdom of Asturias along the northwestern coastal mountains. Shortly after, in 739, Muslim forces were driven from Galicia , which was to eventually host one of medieval Europe's holiest sites, Santiago de Compostela and was incorporated into the new Christian kingdom. The Kingdom of León was the strongest Christian kingdom for centuries. In 1188 the first modern parliamentary session in Europe was held in León ( Cortes of León ). The Kingdom of Castile , formed from Leonese territory, was its successor as strongest kingdom. The kings and the nobility fought for power and influence in this period. The example of the Roman emperors influenced the political objective of the Crown, while the nobles benefited from feudalism .
Muslim armies had also moved north of the Pyrenees but they were defeated by Frankish forces at the Battle of Poitiers , Frankia . Later, Frankish forces established Christian counties on the southern side of the Pyrenees. These areas were to grow into the kingdoms of Navarre and Aragon . [28] For several centuries, the fluctuating frontier between the Muslim and Christian controlled areas of Iberia was along the Ebro and Douro valleys.
The County of Barcelona and the Kingdom of Aragon entered in a dynastic union and gained territory and power in the Mediterranean. In 1229 Majorca was conquered, so was Valencia in 1238.
The break-up of Al-Andalus into the competing taifa kingdoms helped the long embattled Iberian Christian kingdoms gain the initiative. The capture of the strategically central city of Toledo in 1085 marked a significant shift in the balance of power in favour of the Christian kingdoms. Following a great Muslim resurgence in the 12th century, the great Moorish strongholds in the south fell to Christian Spain in the 13th century—Córdoba in 1236 and Seville in 1248. In the 13th and 14th centuries, the Marinid dynasty of Morocco invaded and established some enclaves on the southern coast but failed in their attempt to re-establish North African rule in Iberia and were soon driven out. After 800 years of Muslim presence in Spain, the last Nasrid sultanate of Granada , a tributary state would finally surrender in 1492 to the Catholic monarchs Queen Isabella I of Castile [29] and King Ferdinand II of Aragon . [30] [31] [32]
From the mid 13th century, literature and philosophy started to flourish again in the Christian peninsular kingdoms, based on Roman and Gothic traditions. An important philosopher from this time is Ramon Llull . Abraham Cresques was a prominent Jewish cartographer. Roman law and its institutions were the model for the legislators. The king Alfonso X of Castile focused on strengthening this Roman and Gothic past, and also on linking the Iberian Christian kingdoms with the rest of medieval European Christendom. He worked for being elected emperor of the Holy Roman Empire and published the Siete Partidas code. The Toledo School of Translators is the name that commonly describes the group of scholars who worked together in the city of Toledo during the 12th and 13th centuries, to translate many of the philosophical and scientific works from Classical Arabic , Ancient Greek , and Ancient Hebrew . The Islamic transmission of the classics is the main Islamic contributions to Medieval Europe . The Castilian language—more commonly known (especially later in history and at present) as "Spanish" after becoming the national language and lingua franca of Spain—evolved from Vulgar Latin , as did other Romance languages of Spain like the Catalan , Asturian and Galician languages, as well as other Romance languages in Latin Europe. Basque , the only non-Romance language in Spain, continued evolving from Early Basque to Medieval. The Glosas Emilianenses founded in the monasteries of San Millán de la Cogolla contain the first written words in both Basque and Spanish, having the first become an influence in the formation of the second as an evolution of Latin.
The 13th century also witnessed the Crown of Aragon , centred in Spain's north east, expand its reach across islands in the Mediterranean, to Sicily and even Athens. [33] Around this time the universities of Palencia (1212/1263) and Salamanca (1218/1254) were established. The Black Death of 1348 and 1349 devastated Spain. [34]

Imperial Spain
In 1469, the crowns of the Christian kingdoms of Castile and Aragon were united by the marriage of Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon . 1478 commenced the completion of the conquest of the Canary Islands and in 1492, the combined forces of Castile and Aragon captured the Emirate of Granada from its last ruler Muhammad XII , ending the last remnant of a 781-year presence of Islamic rule in Iberia. That same year, Spain's Jews were ordered to convert to Catholicism or face expulsion from Spanish territories during the Spanish Inquisition . [35] The Treaty of Granada guaranteed religious tolerance towards Muslims, [36] for a few years before Islam was outlawed in 1502 in the Kingdom of Castile and 1527 in the Kingdom of Aragon, leading to Spain's Muslim population becoming nominally Christian Moriscos. A few decades after the Morisco rebellion of Granada known as the War of the Alpujarras , a significant proportion of Spain's formerly-Muslim population was expelled, settling primarily in North Africa. [l] [37]
The year 1492 also marked the arrival of Christopher Columbus in the New World , during a voyage funded by Isabella. Columbus's first voyage crossed the Atlantic and reached the Caribbean Islands, beginning the European exploration and conquest of the Americas, although he remained convinced that he had reached the Orient . The colonisation of the Americas started, with conquistadores like Hernán Cortés and Francisco Pizarro . Miscegenation was the rule between the native and the Spanish cultures and people.
As Renaissance New Monarchs , Isabella and Ferdinand centralised royal power at the expense of local nobility, and the word España , whose root is the ancient name Hispania , began to be commonly used to designate the whole of the two kingdoms. [37] With their wide-ranging political, legal, religious and military reforms, Spain emerged as the first world power .
The unification of the crowns of Aragon and Castile by the marriage of their sovereigns laid the basis for modern Spain and the Spanish Empire, although each kingdom of Spain remained a separate country, in social, political, laws, currency and language. [38] [39]
There were two big revolts against the new Habsburg monarch and the more authoritarian and imperial-style crown: Revolt of the Comuneros in Castile and Revolt of the Brotherhoods in Majorca and Valencia . After years of combat, Comuneros Juan López de Padilla , Juan Bravo and Francisco Maldonado were executed and María Pacheco went into exile. Germana de Foix also finished with the revolt in the Mediterranean.
Spain was Europe's leading power throughout the 16th century and most of the 17th century, a position reinforced by trade and wealth from colonial possessions and became the world's leading maritime power . It reached its apogee during the reigns of the first two Spanish Habsburgs — Charles I (1516–1556) and Philip II (1556–1598). This period saw the Italian Wars , the Revolt of the Comuneros , the Dutch Revolt , the Morisco Revolt , clashes with the Ottomans , the Anglo-Spanish War and wars with France . [40]
Through exploration and conquest or royal marriage alliances and inheritance, the Spanish Empire expanded to include vast areas in the Americas , islands in the Asia-Pacific area, areas of Italy, cities in Northern Africa, as well as parts of what are now France, Germany, Belgium , Luxembourg , and the Netherlands . The first circumnavigation of the world was carried out in 1519–1521. It was the first empire on which it was said that the sun never set . This was an Age of Discovery , with daring explorations by sea and by land, the opening-up of new trade routes across oceans, conquests and the beginnings of European colonialism . Spanish explorers brought back precious metals , spices, luxuries, and previously unknown plants, and played a leading part in transforming the European understanding of the globe. [41] The cultural efflorescence witnessed during this period is now referred to as the Spanish Golden Age . The expansion of the empire caused immense upheaval in the Americas as the collapse of societies and empires and new diseases from Europe devastated American indigenous populations. The rise of humanism , the Counter-Reformation and new geographical discoveries and conquests raised issues that were addressed by the intellectual movement now known as the School of Salamanca , which developed the first modern theories of what are now known as international law and human rights .
In the late 16th century and first half of the 17th century, Spain was confronted by unrelenting challenges from all sides. Barbary pirates , under the aegis of the rapidly growing Ottoman Empire , disrupted life in many coastal areas through their slave raids and the renewed threat of an Islamic invasion . [42] This was at a time when Spain was often at war with France.
The Protestant Reformation dragged the kingdom ever more deeply into the mire of religiously charged wars. The result was a country forced into ever expanding military efforts across Europe and in the Mediterranean. [43]
By the middle decades of a war- and plague -ridden 17th-century Europe, the Spanish Habsburgs had enmeshed the country in continent-wide religious-political conflicts. These conflicts drained it of resources and undermined the economy generally. Spain managed to hold on to most of the scattered Habsburg empire , and help the imperial forces of the Holy Roman Empire reverse a large part of the advances made by Protestant forces, but it was finally forced to recognise the separation of Portugal (with whom it had been united in a personal union of the crowns from 1580 to 1640) and the Netherlands , and eventually suffered some serious military reverses to France in the latter stages of the immensely destructive, Europe-wide Thirty Years' War . [44]
In the latter half of the 17th century, Spain went into a gradual decline, during which it surrendered several small territories to France and the Netherlands; however, it maintained and enlarged its vast overseas empire, which remained intact until the beginning of the 19th century.
The decline culminated in a controversy over succession to the throne which consumed the first years of the 18th century. The War of the Spanish Succession was a wide-ranging international conflict combined with a civil war, and was to cost the kingdom its European possessions and its position as one of the leading powers on the Continent. [45] During this war, a new dynasty originating in France, the Bourbons , was installed. Long united only by the Crown, a true Spanish state was established when the first Bourbon king, Philip V , united the crowns of Castile and Aragon into a single state, abolishing many of the old regional privileges and laws. [46]
The 18th century saw a gradual recovery and an increase in prosperity through much of the empire. The new Bourbon monarchy drew on the French system of modernising the administration and the economy. Enlightenment ideas began to gain ground among some of the kingdom's elite and monarchy. Military assistance for the rebellious British colonies in the American War of Independence improved the kingdom's international standing. [47]

Liberalism, Labour movement and nation state
In 1793, Spain went to war against the revolutionary new French Republic as a member of the first Coalition . The subsequent War of the Pyrenees polarised the country in a reaction against the gallicised elites and following defeat in the field, peace was made with France in 1795 at the Peace of Basel in which Spain lost control over two-thirds of the island of Hispaniola . The Prime Minister, Manuel Godoy , then ensured that Spain allied herself with France in the brief War of the Third Coalition which ended with the British victory at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. In 1807, a secret treaty between Napoleon and the unpopular prime minister led to a new declaration of war against Britain and Portugal. Napoleon's troops entered the country to invade Portugal but instead occupied Spain's major fortresses. The ridiculed Spanish king abdicated in favour of Napoleon's brother, Joseph Bonaparte .
Joseph Bonaparte was seen as a puppet monarch and was regarded with scorn by the Spanish. The 2 May 1808 revolt was one of many nationalist uprisings across the country against the Bonapartist regime. [48] These revolts marked the beginning of a devastating war of independence against the Napoleonic regime. [49] Napoleon was forced to intervene personally, defeating several Spanish armies and forcing a British army to retreat. However, further military action by Spanish armies, guerrillas and Wellington's British-Portuguese forces, combined with Napoleon's disastrous invasion of Russia , led to the ousting of the French imperial armies from Spain in 1814, and the return of King Ferdinand VII . [50]
During the war, in 1810, a revolutionary body, the Cortes of Cádiz , was assembled to co-ordinate the effort against the Bonapartist regime and to prepare a constitution. [51] It met as one body, and its members represented the entire Spanish empire. [52] In 1812 a constitution for universal representation under a constitutional monarchy was declared but after the fall of the Bonapartist regime Ferdinand VII dismissed the Cortes Generales and was determined to rule as an absolute monarch . These events foreshadowed the conflict between conservatives and liberals in the 19th and early 20th centuries.
Spain's conquest by France benefited Latin American anti-colonialists who resented the Imperial Spanish government's policies that favoured Spanish-born citizens ( Peninsulars ) over those born overseas ( Criollos ) and demanded retroversion of the sovereignty to the people . Starting in 1809 Spain's American colonies began a series of revolutions and declared independence, leading to the Spanish American wars of independence that ended Spanish control over its mainland colonies in the Americas. King Ferdinand VII's attempt to re-assert control proved futile as he faced opposition not only in the colonies but also in Spain and army revolts followed, led by liberal officers. By the end of 1826, the only American colonies Spain held were Cuba and Puerto Rico .
The Napoleonic War left Spain economically ruined, deeply divided and politically unstable. In the 1830s and 1840s Anti-liberal forces known as Carlists fought against liberals in the Carlist Wars . Liberal forces won, but the conflict between progressive and conservative liberals ended in a weak early constitutional period. After the Glorious Revolution of 1868 and the short-lived First Spanish Republic , a more stable monarchic period began characterised by the practice of turnismo (the rotation of government control between progressive and conservative liberals within the Spanish government).
In the late 19th century nationalist movements arose in the Philippines and Cuba. In 1895 and 1896 the Cuban War of Independence and the Philippine Revolution broke out and eventually the United States became involved. The Spanish–American War was fought in the spring of 1898 and resulted in Spain losing the last of its once vast colonial empire outside of North Africa. El Desastre (the Disaster), as the war became known in Spain, gave added impetus to the Generation of '98 who were conducting an analysis of the country.
Although the period around the turn of the century was one of increasing prosperity, the 20th century brought little peace; Spain played a minor part in the scramble for Africa , with the colonisation of Western Sahara , Spanish Morocco and Equatorial Guinea . It remained neutral during World War I (see Spain in World War I ). The heavy losses suffered during the Rif War in Morocco brought discredit to the government and undermined the monarchy.
A period of authoritarian rule under General Miguel Primo de Rivera (1923–1931) ended with the establishment of the Second Spanish Republic . The Republic offered political autonomy to the linguistically distinct regions of Basque Country , Catalonia and Galicia and gave voting rights to women .

Spanish Civil War and fascism
The Spanish Civil War broke out in 1936. For three years the Nationalist forces led by General Francisco Franco and supported by Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy fought the Republican side, which was supported by the Soviet Union , Mexico and International Brigades but it was not supported by the Western powers due to the British-led policy of Non-Intervention . The civil war was viciously fought and there were many atrocities committed by all sides . The war claimed the lives of over 500,000 people and caused the flight of up to a half-million citizens from the country. [53] [54] In 1939, General Franco emerged victorious and became a dictator.
The state as established under Franco was nominally neutral in the Second World War, although sympathetic to the Axis . The only legal party under Franco's post civil war regime was the Falange Española Tradicionalista y de las JONS , formed in 1937; the party emphasised falangism , a form of fascism that emphasised anti-communism , nationalism and Roman Catholicism . Given Franco's opposition to competing political parties, the party was renamed the National Movement ( Movimiento Nacional ) in 1949.
After World War II Spain was politically and economically isolated, and was kept out of the United Nations . This changed in 1955, during the Cold War period, when it became strategically important for the US to establish a military presence on the Iberian Peninsula as a counter to any possible move by the Soviet Union into the Mediterranean basin. In the 1960s, Spain registered an unprecedented rate of economic growth which was propelled by industrialisation , a mass internal migration from rural areas to cities and the creation of a mass tourism industry . Franco's rule was also characterised by authoritarianism , promotion of a unitary national identity , the favouring of a very conservative form of Roman Catholicism known as National Catholicism , and discriminatory language policies .
In February 2016, the government of Spain announced it will rename streets named after Franco's administration officials with names of women. [55]

Restoration of democracy and Globalization
In 1962 a group of politicians involved in the opposition to Franco's regime inside the country and in the exile met in the congress of the European Movement in Munich , where they made a resolution in favour of democracy. [56] [57] [58]
With Franco's death in November 1975, Juan Carlos succeeded to the position of King of Spain and head of state in accordance with the franquist law. With the approval of the new Spanish Constitution of 1978 and the restoration of democracy , the State devolved much authority to the regions and created an internal organisation based on autonomous communities . Spanish 1977 Amnesty Law let people of Franco´s regime continue inside institutions without consequences, even responsibles of some crimes during transition to democracy like the Massacre of 3 March 1976 in Vitoria or 1977 Massacre of Atocha .
In the Basque Country, moderate Basque nationalism has coexisted with a radical nationalist movement led by the armed terrorist organisation ETA . [59] The group was formed in 1959 during Franco's rule but has continued to wage its violent campaign even after the restoration of democracy and the return of a large measure of regional autonomy. On 23 February 1981, rebel elements among the security forces seized the Cortes in an attempt to impose a military backed government . King Juan Carlos took personal command of the military and successfully ordered the coup plotters, via national television, to surrender.
During the 1980s the democratic restoration made possible a growing open society. New cultural movements based on freedom appeared, like La Movida Madrileña and a culture of human rights arose with Gregorio Peces-Barba . On 30 May 1982 Spain joined NATO , following a referendum after a strong social opposition. That year the Spanish Socialist Workers Party (PSOE) came to power, the first left-wing government in 43 years. In 1986 Spain joined the European Economic Community , which later became the European Union . The PSOE was replaced in government by the Partido Popular (PP) in 1996 after scandals around participation of the government of Felipe González in the Dirty war against ETA ; at that point the PSOE had served almost 14 consecutive years in office.
On 1 January 2002, Spain fully adopted the euro , and Spain experienced strong economic growth, well above the EU average during the early 2000s. However, well publicised concerns issued by many economic commentators at the height of the boom warned that extraordinary property prices and a high foreign trade deficit were likely to lead to a painful economic collapse. [60]
In 2002 Prestige oil spill happened with big ecological consequences in the Spanish atlantic coastline. In 2003 José María Aznar supported US president George W. Bush in its preventive war against Sadam Hussein´s Iraq . A strong movement against war rose in Spanish society. On 11 March 2004 a local Islamist terrorist group inspired by Al-Qaeda carried out the largest terrorist attack in Spanish history when they killed 191 people and wounded more than 1,800 others by bombing commuter trains in Madrid. [61] Though initial suspicions focused on the Basque terrorist group ETA , evidence soon emerged indicating Islamist involvement. Because of the proximity of the 2004 election , the issue of responsibility quickly became a political controversy, with the main competing parties PP and PSOE exchanging accusations over the handling of the incident. [62] At 14 March elections, PSOE, led by José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero won the elections.
The proportion of Spain's foreign born population increased rapidly from around 1 in 50 in 2000 to almost 1 in 8 in 2010 but has since declined. In 2005 the Spanish government legalised same sex marriage . Decentralisation was supported with much resistance of Constitutional Court and conservative opposition, so did gender politics like quotas or the law against gender violence. Government talks with ETA happened, and the band announced its permanent cease of violence in 2010.
The bursting of the Spanish property bubble in 2008 led to the 2008–16 Spanish financial crisis and high levels of unemployment , cuts in government spending and corruption in Royal family and People's Party served as a backdrop to the 2011–12 Spanish protests . Catalan independentism was also on rise. In 2011 Mariano Rajoy 's conservative People's Party won elections with 44.6% of votes and Rajoy became the Spanish Prime Minister after having been the leader of the opposition from 2004 to 2011 with a program of cutting social spends. On 19 June 2014, the monarch , Juan Carlos, abdicated in favour of his son, who became Felipe VI . Bipartidism in Spanish politics got to an end with the entrance of new forces in representative institutions. In 2015, left-wing mayors got control of biggest cities in the country as former judge and former co-founder of the labour law office where the 1977 Massacre of Atocha took place Manuela Carmena in Madrid , co-founder and spokesperson of the Platform for People Affected by Mortgages Ada Colau in Barcelona , Valencia or Zaragoza , the first time that happens since the Spanish Second Republic. Even though, in general election of the same year, conservative People's Party revalidated its majority in the parliament.

Geography
At 505,992 km 2 (195,365 sq mi), Spain is the world's fifty-second largest country and Europe's fourth largest country . It is some 47,000 km 2 (18,000 sq mi) smaller than France and 81,000 km 2 (31,000 sq mi) larger than the US state of California . Mount Teide ( Tenerife ) is the highest mountain peak in Spain and is the third largest volcano in the world from its base. Spain is a transcontinental country .
Spain lies between latitudes 26° and 44° N , and longitudes 19° W and 5° E .
On the west, Spain is bordered by Portugal ; on the south, it is bordered by Gibraltar (a British overseas territory ) and Morocco , through its exclaves in North Africa ( Ceuta and Melilla , and the peninsula of Vélez de la Gomera ). On the northeast, along the Pyrenees mountain range, it is bordered by France and the Principality of Andorra . Along the Pyrenees in Girona , a small exclave town called Llívia is surrounded by France.
Extending to 1,214 km (754 mi), the Portugal–Spain border is the longest uninterrupted border within the European Union . [63]

Islands
Spain also includes the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea , the Canary Islands in the Atlantic Ocean and a number of uninhabited islands on the Mediterranean side of the Strait of Gibraltar , known as plazas de soberanía ("places of sovereignty", or territories under Spanish sovereignty), such as the Chafarinas Islands and Alhucemas . The peninsula of Vélez de la Gomera is also regarded as a plaza de soberanía . The isle of Alborán , located in the Mediterranean between Spain and North Africa, is also administered by Spain, specifically by the municipality of Almería , Andalusia. The little Pheasant Island in the River Bidasoa is a Spanish-French condominium .
Largest inhabited islands of Spain:

Mountains and rivers
Mainland Spain is a mountainous country, dominated by high plateaus and mountain chains. After the Pyrenees, the main mountain ranges are the Cordillera Cantábrica (Cantabrian Range), Sistema Ibérico (Iberian System), Sistema Central (Central System), Montes de Toledo , Sierra Morena and the Sistema Bético (Baetic System) whose highest peak, the 3,478 metres (11,411 ft) Mulhacén , located in Sierra Nevada , is the highest elevation in the Iberian Peninsula. The highest point in Spain is the Teide , a 3,718-metre (12,198 ft) active volcano in the Canary Islands. The Meseta Central (often translated as "Inner Plateau") is a vast plateau in the heart of peninsular Spain.
There are several major rivers in Spain such as the Tagus ( Tajo ), Ebro , Guadiana , Douro ( Duero ), Guadalquivir , Júcar , Segura , Turia and Minho ( Miño ). Alluvial plains are found along the coast, the largest of which is that of the Guadalquivir in Andalusia .

Climate
Three main climatic zones can be separated, according to geographical situation and orographic conditions: [64] [65] [66]
Apart from these main types, other sub-types can be found, like the alpine and continental climates ( Dfc , Dfb / Dsc , Dsb ) in the Pyrenees as well as parts of the Cantabrian Range , the Central System , Sierra Nevada and the Iberian System , and a typical desert climate ( BWk , BWh ) in the zone of Almería, Murcia and eastern Canary Islands . Low-lying areas of the Canary Islands average above 18.0 °C (64.4 °F) during their coldest month, thus having a tropical climate .

Fauna and flora
The fauna presents a wide diversity that is due in large part to the geographical position of the Iberian peninsula between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean and between Africa and Eurasia , and the great diversity of habitats and biotopes , the result of a considerable variety of climates and well differentiated regions.
The vegetation of Spain is varied due to several factors including the diversity of the relief, the climate and latitude . Spain includes different phytogeographic regions, each with its own floristic characteristics resulting largely from the interaction of climate, topography, soil type and fire, biotic factors.

Politics
According to the Democracy Index of the EIU, Spain is one of the 20 full democracies in the world.
The Spanish Constitution of 1978 is the culmination of the Spanish transition to democracy . The constitutional history of Spain dates back to the constitution of 1812. Impatient with the slow pace of democratic political reforms in 1976 and 1977, Spain's new King Juan Carlos , known for his formidable personality, dismissed Carlos Arias Navarro and appointed the reformer Adolfo Suárez as Prime Minister. [67] [68] The resulting general election in 1977 convened the Constituent Cortes (the Spanish Parliament, in its capacity as a constitutional assembly) for the purpose of drafting and approving the constitution of 1978. [69] After a national referendum on 6 December 1978, 88% of voters approved of the new constitution.
As a result, Spain is now composed of 17 autonomous communities and two autonomous cities with varying degrees of autonomy thanks to its Constitution, which nevertheless explicitly states the indivisible unity of the Spanish nation. The constitution also specifies that Spain has no state religion and that all are free to practice and believe as they wish.
The Spanish administration approved legislation in 2007 aimed at furthering equality between genders in Spanish political and economic life (Gender Equality Act). [70] [71] However, in the legislative branch, as of May 2017 only 140 of the 350 members of the Congress were women (40%). [72] It places Spain 12th on a list of countries ranked by proportion of women in the lower house . In the Senate, there are only 101 women out of 263 (38.0%). [73] The Gender Empowerment Measure of Spain in the United Nations Human Development Report is 0.794, 12th in the world. [74]

Government
Spain is a constitutional monarchy , with a hereditary monarch and a bicameral parliament , the Cortes Generales (General Courts). The executive branch consists of a Council of Ministers of Spain presided over by the Prime Minister , nominated and appointed by the monarch and confirmed by the Congress of Deputies following legislative elections. By political custom established by King Juan Carlos since the ratification of the 1978 Constitution, the king's nominees have all been from parties who maintain a plurality of seats in the Congress.
The legislative branch is made up of the Congress of Deputies ( Congreso de los Diputados ) with 350 members, elected by popular vote on block lists by proportional representation to serve four-year terms, and a Senate ( Senado ) with 259 seats of which 208 are directly elected by popular vote and the other 51 appointed by the regional legislatures to also serve four-year terms.
Spain is organisationally structured as a so-called Estado de las Autonomías ("State of Autonomies"); it is one of the most decentralised countries in Europe, along with Switzerland, Germany and Belgium; [75] for example, all autonomous communities have their own elected parliaments, governments, public administrations, budgets, and resources. Health and education systems among others are managed by the Spanish communities, and in addition, the Basque Country and Navarre also manage their own public finances based on foral provisions. In Catalonia, the Basque Country, Navarre and the Canary Islands, a full-fledged autonomous police corps replaces some of the State police functions (see Mossos d'Esquadra , Ertzaintza , Policía Foral/Foruzaingoa and Policía Canaria ).

Human rights
The Government respects the human rights of its citizens; although there are a few problems in some areas, the law and judiciary provide effective means of addressing individual instances of abuse. There are allegations that a few members of the security forces abused detainees and mistreated foreigners and illegal immigrants. [76] According to Amnesty International (AI), government investigations of such alleged abuses are often lengthy and punishments were light. [77] Violence against women was a problem, which the Government took steps to address. [78] [79]
Spain provides one of the highest degrees of liberty in the world for its LGBT community. Among the countries studied by Pew Research Center in 2013, Spain is rated first in acceptance of homosexuality, with an 88% of society supporting the gay community compared to 11% who do not. [80]

Administrative divisions
The Spanish State is integrated by 17 autonomous communities and 2 autonomous cities, both groups being the highest or first-order administrative division in the country. Autonomous communities are integrated by provinces, of which there are 50 in total, and in turn, provinces are integrated by municipalities. In Catalonia, two additional divisions exist, the comarques (sing. comarca ) and the vegueries (sing. vegueria ) both of which have administrative powers; comarques being aggregations of municipalities, and the vegueries being aggregations of comarques . The concept of a comarca exists in all autonomous communities, however, unlike Catalonia, these are merely historical or geographical subdivisions.

Autonomous communities
Spain's autonomous communities are the first level administrative divisions of the country. They were created after the current constitution came into effect (in 1978) in recognition of the right to self-government of the " nationalities and regions of Spain ". [81] The autonomous communities were to be integrated into adjacent provinces with common historical, cultural, and economical traits. This territorial organisation, based on devolution , is literally known in Spain as the "State of Autonomies".
The basic institutional law of each autonomous community is the Statute of Autonomy . The Statutes of Autonomy establish the name of the community according to its historical and contemporary identity, the limits of its territories, the name and organisation of the institutions of government and the rights they enjoy according to the constitution. [82]
The governments of all autonomous communities must be based on a division of powers comprising:
Catalonia, Galicia and the Basque Country, which identified themselves as nationalities , were granted self-government through a rapid process. Andalusia also took that denomination in its first Statute of Autonomy, even though it followed the longer process stipulated in the constitution for the rest of the country. Progressively, other communities in revisions to their Statutes of Autonomy have also taken that denomination in accordance to their historical and modern identities, such as the Valencian Community, [83] the Canary Islands, [84] the Balearic Islands, [85] and Aragon. [86]
The autonomous communities have wide legislative and executive autonomy, with their own parliaments and regional governments. The distribution of powers may be different for every community, as laid out in their Statutes of Autonomy, since devolution was intended to be asymmetrical. Only two communities—the Basque Country and Navarre—have full fiscal autonomy. Aside of fiscal autonomy, the nationalities —Andalusia, the Basque Country, Catalonia, and Galicia—were devolved more powers than the rest of the communities, among them the ability of the regional president to dissolve the parliament and call for elections at any time. In addition, the Basque Country, Catalonia and Navarre have police corps of their own: Ertzaintza , Mossos d'Esquadra and the Policía Foral respectively. Other communities have more limited forces or none at all, like the Policía Autónoma Andaluza [87] in Andalusia or the BESCAM in Madrid .
Nonetheless, recent amendments to existing Statutes of Autonomy or the promulgation of new Statutes altogether, have reduced the asymmetry between the powers originally granted to the nationalities and the rest of the regions.
Finally, along with the 17 autonomous communities, two autonomous cities are also part of the State of Autonomies and are first-order territorial divisions: Ceuta and Melilla . These are two exclaves located in the northern African coast.

Provinces and municipalities
Autonomous communities are subdivided into provinces , which served as their territorial building blocks. In turn, provinces are integrated by municipalities . The existence of both the provinces and the municipalities is guaranteed and protected by the constitution, not necessarily by the Statutes of Autonomy themselves. Municipalities are granted autonomy to manage their internal affairs, and provinces are the territorial divisions designed to carry out the activities of the State. [88]
The current provincial division structure is based—with minor changes—on the 1833 territorial division by Javier de Burgos , and in all, the Spanish territory is divided into 50 provinces. The communities of Asturias, Cantabria, La Rioja, the Balearic Islands, Madrid, Murcia and Navarre are the only communities that are integrated by a single province, which is coextensive with the community itself. In these cases, the administrative institutions of the province are replaced by the governmental institutions of the community.

Foreign relations
After the return of democracy following the death of Franco in 1975, Spain's foreign policy priorities were to break out of the diplomatic isolation of the Franco years and expand diplomatic relations , enter the European Community , and define security relations with the West.
As a member of NATO since 1982, Spain has established itself as a participant in multilateral international security activities. Spain's EU membership represents an important part of its foreign policy. Even on many international issues beyond western Europe, Spain prefers to co-ordinate its efforts with its EU partners through the European political co-operation mechanisms. [ vague ]
Spain has maintained its special relations with Hispanic America and the Philippines . Its policy emphasises the concept of an Ibero-American community, essentially the renewal of the historically liberal concept of " Hispanidad " or " Hispanismo " , as it is often referred to in English, which has sought to link the Iberian Peninsula with Hispanic America through language, commerce, history and culture.
Spain claims Gibraltar , a 6-square-kilometre (2.3 sq mi) Overseas Territory of the United Kingdom in the southernmost part of the Iberian Peninsula . Then a Spanish town, it was conquered by an Anglo-Dutch force in 1704 during the War of the Spanish Succession on behalf of Archduke Charles , pretender to the Spanish throne.
The legal situation concerning Gibraltar was settled in 1713 by the Treaty of Utrecht , in which Spain ceded the territory in perpetuity to the British Crown [90] stating that, should the British abandon this post, it would be offered to Spain first. Since the 1940s Spain has called for the return of Gibraltar. The overwhelming majority of Gibraltarians strongly oppose this, along with any proposal of shared sovereignty. [91] UN resolutions call on the United Kingdom and Spain, both EU members, to reach an agreement over the status of Gibraltar. [92] [93]
The Spanish claim makes a distinction between the isthmus that connects the Rock to the Spanish mainland on the one hand, and the Rock and city of Gibraltar on the other. While the Rock and city were ceded by the Treaty of Utrecht, Spain asserts that the "occupation of the isthmus is illegal and against the principles of International Law ". [94] The United Kingdom relies on de facto arguments of possession by prescription in relation to the isthmus, [95] as there has been "continuous possession [of the isthmus] over a long period". [96]
Another claim by Spain is about the Savage Islands , a claim not recognised by Portugal. Spain claims that they are rocks rather than islands, therefore claiming that there is no Portuguese territorial waters around the disputed islands. On 5 July 2013, Spain sent a letter to the UN expressing these views. [97] [98]
Spain claims the sovereignty over the Perejil Island , a small, uninhabited rocky islet located in the South shore of the Strait of Gibraltar . The island lies 250 metres (820 ft) just off the coast of Morocco, 8 kilometres (5.0 mi) from Ceuta and 13.5 kilometres (8.4 mi) from mainland Spain. Its sovereignty is disputed between Spain and Morocco. It was the subject of an armed incident between the two countries in 2002. The incident ended when both countries agreed to return to the status quo ante which existed prior to the Moroccan occupation of the island. The islet is now deserted and without any sign of sovereignty.
Besides the Perejil Island, the Spanish-held territories claimed by other countries are two: Morocco claims the Spanish cities of Ceuta and Melilla and the plazas de soberanía islets off the northern coast of Africa; and Portugal does not recognise Spain's sovereignty over the territory of Olivenza .

Military
The armed forces of Spain are known as the Spanish Armed Forces ( Fuerzas Armadas Españolas ). Their Commander-in-chief is the King of Spain , Felipe VI . [99]
The Spanish Armed Forces are divided into three branches: [100]

Economy
Spain's capitalist mixed economy is the 14th largest worldwide and the 5th largest in the European Union , as well as the Eurozone 's 4th largest.
The centre-right government of former prime minister José María Aznar worked successfully to gain admission to the group of countries launching the euro in 1999. Unemployment stood at 7.6% in October 2006, a rate that compared favourably to many other European countries, and especially with the early 1990s when it stood at over 20%. Perennial weak points of Spain's economy include high inflation, [101] a large underground economy , [102] and an education system which OECD reports place among the poorest for developed countries, together with the United States and UK. [103]
By the mid-1990s the economy had recommenced the growth that had been disrupted by the global recession of the early 1990s. The strong economic growth helped the government to reduce the government debt as a percentage of GDP and Spain's high unemployment began to drop steadily. With the government budget in balance and inflation under control Spain was admitted into the Eurozone in 1999.
Since the 1990s some Spanish companies have gained multinational status, often expanding their activities in culturally close Latin America. Spain is the second biggest foreign investor there, after the United States. Spanish companies have also expanded into Asia, especially China and India. [104] This early global expansion is a competitive advantage over its competitors and European neighbours. The reason for this early expansion is the booming interest towards Spanish language and culture in Asia and Africa and a corporate culture that learned to take risks in unstable markets.
Spanish companies invested in fields like renewable energy commercialisation ( Iberdrola was the world's largest renewable energy operator [105] ), technology companies like Telefónica , Abengoa , Mondragon Corporation , Movistar , Hisdesat , Indra , train manufacturers like CAF , Talgo , global corporations such as the textile company Inditex , petroleum companies like Repsol and infrastructure, with six of the ten biggest international construction firms specialising in transport being Spanish, like Ferrovial , Acciona , ACS , OHL and FCC . [106]
In 2005 the Economist Intelligence Unit 's quality of life survey placed Spain among the top 10 in the world. [107] In 2013 the same survey (now called the "Where-to-be-born index"), ranked Spain 28th in the world. [108]
In 2010, the Basque city of Bilbao was awarded with the Lee Kuan Yew World City Prize , [109] and its mayor at the time, Iñaki Azkuna , was awarded the World Mayor Prize in 2012. [110] The Basque capital city of Vitoria-Gasteiz received the European Green Capital Award in 2012. [111]

Agriculture
Crop areas were farmed in two highly diverse manners. Areas relying on non-irrigated cultivation ( secano ), which made up 85% of the entire crop area, depended solely on rainfall as a source of water. They included the humid regions of the north and the northwest, as well as vast arid zones that had not been irrigated. The much more productive regions devoted to irrigated cultivation ( regadío ) accounted for 3 million hectares in 1986, and the government hoped that this area would eventually double, as it already had doubled since 1950. Particularly noteworthy was the development in Almería —one of the most arid and desolate provinces of Spain—of winter crops of various fruits and vegetables for export to Europe.
Though only about 17% of Spain's cultivated land was irrigated, it was estimated to be the source of between 40–45% of the gross value of crop production and of 50% of the value of agricultural exports. More than half of the irrigated area was planted in corn , fruit trees , and vegetables . Other agricultural products that benefited from irrigation included grapes , cotton , sugar beets , potatoes , legumes , olive trees , mangos, strawberries , tomatoes , and fodder grasses. Depending on the nature of the crop, it was possible to harvest two successive crops in the same year on about 10% of the country's irrigated land.
Citrus fruits , vegetables , cereal grains , olive oil , and wine —Spain's traditional agricultural products—continued to be important in the 1980s. In 1983 they represented 12%, 12%, 8%, 6%, and 4%, respectively, of the country's agricultural production. Because of the changed diet of an increasingly affluent population, there was a notable increase in the consumption of livestock , poultry , and dairy products . Meat production for domestic consumption became the single most important agricultural activity, accounting for 30% of all farm-related production in 1983. Increased attention to livestock was the reason that Spain became a net importer of grains. Ideal growing conditions, combined with proximity to important north European markets, made citrus fruits Spain's leading export. Fresh vegetables and fruits produced through intensive irrigation farming also became important export commodities, as did sunflower seed oil that was produced to compete with the more expensive olive oils in oversupply throughout the Mediterranean countries of the European Community .

Tourism
The climate of Spain, its geographic location, popular coastlines, diverse landscapes, historical legacy, vibrant culture and excellent infrastructure, has made Spain's international tourist industry among the largest in the world. In the last five decades, international tourism in Spain has grown to become the second largest in the world in terms of spending, worth approximately 40 billion Euros or about 5% of GDP in 2006. [112] [113]

Energy
Spain is one of the world's leading countries in the development and production of renewable energy. In 2010 Spain became the solar power world leader when it overtook the United States with a massive power station plant called La Florida , near Alvarado, Badajoz . [114] [115] Spain is also Europe's main producer of wind energy. In 2010 its wind turbines generated 42,976 GWh, which accounted for 16.4% of all electrical energy produced in Spain. [116] [117] [118] On 9 November 2010, wind energy reached an instantaneous historic peak covering 53% of mainland electricity demand [119] and generating an amount of energy that is equivalent to that of 14 nuclear reactors . [120] Other renewable energies used in Spain are hydroelectric , biomass and marine (2 power plants under construction). [121]
Non-renewable energy sources used in Spain are nuclear (8 operative reactors), gas , coal , and oil . Fossil fuels together generated 58% of Spain's electricity in 2009, just below the OECD mean of 61%. Nuclear power generated another 19%, and wind and hydro about 12% each. [122]

Transport
The Spanish road system is mainly centralised, with six highways connecting Madrid to the Basque Country , Catalonia , Valencia , West Andalusia , Extremadura and Galicia . Additionally, there are highways along the Atlantic ( Ferrol to Vigo ), Cantabrian ( Oviedo to San Sebastián ) and Mediterranean ( Girona to Cádiz ) coasts. Spain aims to put one million electric cars on the road by 2014 as part of the government's plan to save energy and boost energy efficiency . [123] The former Minister of Industry Miguel Sebastián said that "the electric vehicle is the future and the engine of an industrial revolution." [124]
Spain has the most extensive high-speed rail network in Europe, and the second-most extensive in the world after China. [125] [126] As of October 2010, Spain has a total of 3,500 km (2,174.80 mi) of high-speed tracks linking Málaga , Seville , Madrid , Barcelona , Valencia and Valladolid , with the trains reaching speeds up to 300 km/h (190 mph). On average, the Spanish high-speed train is the fastest one in the world, followed by the Japanese bullet train and the French TGV . [127] Regarding punctuality, it is second in the world (98.54% on-time arrival) after the Japanese Shinkansen (99%). [128] Should the aims of the ambitious AVE programme (Spanish high speed trains) be met, by 2020 Spain will have 7,000 km (4,300 mi) of high-speed trains linking almost all provincial cities to Madrid in less than three hours and Barcelona within four hours.
There are 47 public airports in Spain. The busiest one is the airport of Madrid (Barajas), with 50 million passengers in 2011, being the world's 15th busiest airport , as well as the European Union's fourth busiest. The airport of Barcelona (El Prat) is also important, with 35 million passengers in 2011, being the world's 31st-busiest airport. Other main airports are located in Majorca (23 million passengers), Málaga (13 million passengers), Las Palmas (Gran Canaria) (11 million passengers), Alicante (10 million passengers) and smaller, with the number of passengers between 4 and 10 million, for example Tenerife (two airports), Valencia , Seville , Bilbao , Ibiza , Lanzarote , Fuerteventura . Also, more than 30 airports with the number of passengers below 4 million.

Science and technology
In the 19th and 20th centuries science in Spain was held back by severe political instability and consequent economic underdevelopment. Despite the conditions, some important scientists and engineers emerged. The most notable were Miguel Servet , Santiago Ramón y Cajal , Narcís Monturiol , Celedonio Calatayud , Juan de la Cierva , Leonardo Torres y Quevedo , Margarita Salas and Severo Ochoa .

Water supply and sanitation
Water supply and sanitation in Spain is characterised by universal access and generally good service quality, while tariffs are among the lowest in the EU. [129] Almost half of the population is served by private or mixed private-public water companies, which operate under concession contracts with municipalities. The largest of the private water companies, with a market share of about 50% of the private concessions, is Aguas de Barcelona ( Agbar ). However, the large cities are all served by public companies except Barcelona and Valencia. The largest public company is Canal de Isabel II , which serves the metropolitan area of Madrid.
Droughts affect water supply in Southern Spain, which increasingly is turning towards seawater desalination to meet its water needs.

Demographics
In 2008 the population of Spain officially reached 46 million people, as recorded by the Padrón municipal (Spain's Municipal Register). [130] Spain's population density, at 91/km² (235/sq mi), is lower than that of most Western European countries and its distribution across the country is very unequal. With the exception of the region surrounding the capital, Madrid , the most populated areas lie around the coast. The population of Spain more than doubled since 1900, when it stood at 18.6 million, principally due to the spectacular demographic boom in the 1960s and early 1970s. [131]
Native Spaniards make up 88% of the total population of Spain. After the birth rate plunged in the 1980s and Spain's population growth rate dropped, the population again trended upward, based initially on the return of many Spaniards who had emigrated to other European countries during the 1970s, and more recently, fuelled by large numbers of immigrants who make up 12% of the population. The immigrants originate mainly in Latin America (39%), North Africa (16%), Eastern Europe (15%), and Sub-Saharan Africa (4%). [132] In 2005, Spain instituted a three-month amnesty programme through which certain hitherto undocumented aliens were granted legal residency.
In 2008, Spain granted citizenship to 84,170 persons, mostly to people from Ecuador, Colombia and Morocco. [133] A sizeable portion of foreign residents in Spain also comes from other Western and Central European countries. These are mostly British, French, German, Dutch, and Norwegian. They reside primarily on the Mediterranean coast and the Balearic islands, where many choose to live their retirement or telecommute .
Substantial populations descended from Spanish colonists and immigrants exist in other parts of the world, most notably in Latin America. Beginning in the late 15th century, large numbers of Iberian colonists settled in what became Latin America and at present most white Latin Americans (who make up about one-third of Latin America's population) are of Spanish or Portuguese origin. Around 240,000 Spaniards emigrated in the 16th century, mostly to Peru and Mexico . [134] Another 450,000 left in the 17th century. [135] Between 1846 and 1932 it is estimated that nearly 5 million Spaniards emigrated to the Americas, especially to Argentina and Brazil . [136] Approximately two million Spaniards migrated to other Western European countries between 1960 and 1975. During the same period perhaps 300,000 went to Latin America. [137]

Peoples
The Spanish Constitution of 1978 , in its second article, recognises several contemporary entities — nationalities — [m] and regions, within the context of the Spanish nation.
Spain is de facto a plurinational state . [146] [147] The idendity of Spain rather accrues of an overlap of different territorial and ethnolinguistic identities than of a sole Spanish identity. In some cases some of the territorial identities may conflict with the dominant Spanish culture. Distinct traditional identities within Spain include the Basques , Catalans , Galicians , Andalusians and Valencians , [148] although to some extent all of the 17 autonomous communities may claim a distinct local identity.
It is this last feature of "shared identity" between the more local level or autonomous community and the Spanish level which makes the identity question in Spain complex and far from univocal.

Minority groups
Spain has a number of descendants of populations from former colonies, especially Latin America and North Africa . Smaller numbers of immigrants from several Sub-Saharan countries have recently been settling in Spain. There are also sizeable numbers of Asian immigrants, most of whom are of Middle Eastern , South Asian and Chinese origin. The single largest group of immigrants are European; represented by large numbers of Romanians, Britons, Germans , French and others. [149]
The arrival of the gitanos , a Romani people , began in the 16th century; estimates of the Spanish Roma population range from 750,000 to over one million. [150] [151] [152] [153] [154] There are also the mercheros (also quinquis ), a formerly nomadic minority group. Their origin is unclear.
Historically, Sephardi Jews and Moriscos are the main minority groups originated in Spain and with a contribution to Spanish culture. [155] The Spanish government is offering Spanish nationality to Sephardi Jews. [156]

Immigration
According to the Spanish government there were 5.7 million foreign residents in Spain in 2011, or 12% of the total population. According to residence permit data for 2011, more than 860,000 were Romanian , about 770,000 were Moroccan , approximately 390,000 were British, and 360,000 were Ecuadorian . [157] Other sizeable foreign communities are Colombian , Bolivian , German , Italian , Bulgarian , and Chinese. There are more than 200,000 migrants from Sub-Saharan Africa living in Spain, principally Senegaleses and Nigerians . [158] Since 2000, Spain has experienced high population growth as a result of immigration flows, despite a birth rate that is only half the replacement level. This sudden and ongoing inflow of immigrants, particularly those arriving illegally by sea, has caused noticeable social tension. [159]
Within the EU, Spain had the 2nd highest immigration rate in percentage terms after Cyprus , but by a great margin, the highest in absolute numbers, up to 2008. [160] The number of immigrants in Spain had grown up from 500,000 people in 1996 to 5.2 million in 2008 out of a total population of 46 million. [161] [162] In 2005 alone, a regularisation programme increased the legal immigrant population by 700,000 people. [163] There are a number of reasons for the high level of immigration, including Spain's cultural ties with Latin America , its geographical position, the porosity of its borders, the large size of its underground economy and the strength of the agricultural and construction sectors, which demand more low cost labour than can be offered by the national workforce.
Another statistically significant factor is the large number of residents of EU origin typically retiring to Spain's Mediterranean coast. In fact, Spain was Europe's largest absorber of migrants from 2002 to 2007, with its immigrant population more than doubling as 2.5 million people arrived. [164] In 2008, prior to the onset of the economic crisis, the Financial Times reported that Spain was the most favoured destination for Western Europeans considering a move from their own country and seeking jobs elsewhere in the EU. [165]
In 2008, the government instituted a "Plan of Voluntary Return" which encouraged unemployed immigrants from outside the EU to return to their home countries and receive several incentives, including the right to keep their unemployment benefits and transfer whatever they contributed to the Spanish Social Security. [166] The programme had little effect; during its first two months, just 1,400 immigrants took up the offer. [167] What the programme failed to do, the sharp and prolonged economic crisis has done from 2010 to 2011 in that tens of thousands of immigrants have left the country due to lack of jobs. In 2011 alone, more than half a million people left Spain. [168] For the first time in decades the net migration rate was expected to be negative, and nine out of 10 emigrants were foreigners. [168]

Languages
Spain is openly multilingual, [169] and the constitution establishes that the nation will protect "all Spaniards and the peoples of Spain in the exercise of human rights, their cultures and traditions, languages and institutions. [170]
Spanish ( español )—officially recognised in the constitution as Castilian ( castellano )—is the official language of the entire country, and it is the right and duty of every Spaniard to know the language. The constitution also establishes that "all other Spanish languages"—that is, all other languages of Spain—will also be official in their respective autonomous communities in accordance to their Statutes , their organic regional legislations, and that the "richness of the distinct linguistic modalities of Spain represents a patrimony which will be the object of special respect and protection." [171]
The other official languages of Spain, co-official with Spanish are:
As a percentage of the general population, Basque is spoken by 2%, Catalan (or Valencian) by 17%, and Galician by 7% of all Spaniards. [172]
In Catalonia , Aranese ( aranés ), a local variety of the Occitan language , has been declared co-official along with Catalan and Spanish since 2006. It is spoken only in the comarca of Val d'Aran by roughly 6,700 people. Other Romance minority languages , though not official, have special recognition, such as the Astur-Leonese group ( Asturian – asturianu , also called bable – in Asturias [173] and Leonese – llionés – in Castile and León ) and Aragonese ( aragonés ) in Aragon .
In the North African Spanish autonomous city of Melilla , Riff Berber is spoken by a significant part of the population. In the tourist areas of the Mediterranean coast and the islands, English and German are widely spoken by tourists, foreign residents, and tourism workers. [174]

Education
State education in Spain is free and compulsory from the age of six to sixteen. The current education system was established by the 2006 educational law, LOE ( Ley Orgánica de Educación ), or Fundamental Law for the Education. [175] In 2014, the LOE was partially modified by the newer and controversial LOMCE law ( Ley Orgánica para la Mejora de la Calidad Educativa ), or Fundamental Law for the Improvement of the Education System, commonly called Ley Wert (Wert Law). [176] Since 1970 to 2014, Spain has had seven different educational laws (LGE, LOECE, LODE, LOGSE, LOPEG, LOE and LOMCE). [177]
Institución Libre de Enseñanza was an educational project that developed in Spain for the half a century of about 1876–1936 by Francisco Giner de los Ríos and Gumersindo de Azcárate . The institute was inspired by the philosophy of Krausism . Concepción Arenal in feminism and Santiago Ramón y Cajal in neuroscience were in the movement.

Health
The health care system of Spain ( Spanish National Health System ) is considered one of the best in the world, in 7th position in the ranking elaborated by the World Health Organization . [178] The health care is public, universal and free for any legal citizen of Spain. [179] The total health spending is 9.4% of the GDP, slightly above the average of 9.3% of the OECD .

Religion
Roman Catholicism has long been the main religion of Spain, and although it no longer has official status by law, in all public schools in Spain students have to choose either a religion or ethics class. Catholicism is the religion most commonly taught, although the teaching of Islam, [180] Judaism, [181] and evangelical Christianity [182] is also recognised in law. According to a June 2016 study by the Spanish Centre for Sociological Research about 68% of Spaniards self-identify as Catholics, 2% other faith, and about 27% identify with no religion . Most Spaniards do not participate regularly in religious services. This same study shows that of the Spaniards who identify themselves as religious, 59% hardly ever or never go to church, 16% go to church some times a year, 9% some time per month and 15% every Sunday or multiple times per week. [4] Recent polls and surveys have revealed that atheists and agnostics comprise anywhere from 20% to 27% of the Spanish population. [4] [183] [184]
Altogether, about 9% of the entire Spanish population attends religious services at least once per month. [4] Though Spanish society has become considerably more secular in recent decades, the influx of Latin American immigrants, who tend to be strong Catholic practitioners, has helped the Catholic Church to recover.
There have been four Spanish Popes . Damasus I , Calixtus III , Alexander VI and Benedict XIII . Spanish mysticism was an important intellectual fight against Protestantism with Teresa of Ávila , a reformist nun, ahead. The Society of Jesus was founded by Ignatius of Loyola and Francisco Javier . In the 1960s, Jesuits Pedro Arrupe and Ignacio Ellacuría were inside the movement of Liberation Theology .
Protestant churches have about 1,200,000 members. [185] There are about 105,000 Jehovah's Witnesses . The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has approximately 46,000 adherents in 133 congregations in all regions of the country and has a temple in the Moratalaz District of Madrid. [186]
A study made by the Union of Islamic Communities of Spain demonstrated that there were about 1,700,000 inhabitants of Muslim background living in Spain as of 2012 [update] , accounting for 3–4% of the total population of Spain. The vast majority was composed of immigrants and descendants originating from Morocco and other African countries. More than 514,000 (30%) of them had Spanish nationality. [187]
The recent waves of immigration have also led to an increasing number of Hindus , Buddhists , Sikhs and Muslims . After the Reconquista in 1492, Muslims did not live in Spain for centuries. Late 19th-century colonial expansion in northwestern Africa gave a number of residents in Spanish Morocco and Western Sahara full citizenship. Their ranks have since been bolstered by recent immigration, especially from Morocco and Algeria.
Judaism was practically non-existent in Spain from the 1492 expulsion until the 19th century, when Jews were again permitted to enter the country. Currently there are around 62,000 Jews in Spain, or 0.14% of the total population. Most are arrivals in the past century, while some are descendants of earlier Spanish Jews. Approximately 80,000 Jews are thought to have lived in Spain prior to its expulsion. [188]

Culture
Culturally, Spain is a Western country . Almost every aspect of Spanish life is permeated by its Roman heritage, making Spain one of the major Latin countries of Europe. Spanish culture is marked by strong historic ties to Catholicism, which played a pivotal role in the country's formation and subsequent identity. Spanish art, architecture, cuisine, and music has been shaped by successive waves of foreign invaders, as well as by the country's Mediterranean climate and geography. The centuries-long colonial era globalised Spanish language and culture, with Spain also absorbing the cultural and commercial products of its diverse empire.

World Heritage Sites
It should be noted that after Italy (49) and China (45), Spain is the third country in the world with the most World Heritage Sites . At the present time it has 44 recognised sites, including the landscape of Monte Perdido in the Pyrenees , which is shared with France , the Prehistoric Rock Art Sites of the Côa Valley and Siega Verde , which is shared with Portugal (the Portuguese part being in the Côa Valley, Guarda ), and the Heritage of Mercury , shared with Slovenia . [189] In addition, Spain has also 14 Intangible cultural heritage , or "Human treasures", Spain ranks first in Europe according to UNESCO's Intangible Cultural Heritage List , tied with Croatia . [190]

Literature
The earliest recorded examples of vernacular Romance-based literature date from the same time and location, the rich mix of Muslim, Jewish, and Christian cultures in Muslim Spain, in which Maimonides, Averroes, and others worked, the Kharjas ( Jarchas ).
During the Reconquista , the epic poem Cantar de Mio Cid was written about a real man—his battles, conquests, and daily life.
Other major plays from the medieval times were Mester de Juglaría , Mester de Clerecía , Coplas por la muerte de su padre or El Libro de buen amor (The Book of Good Love).
During the Renaissance the major plays are La Celestina and El Lazarillo de Tormes , while many religious literature was created with poets as Luis de León , San Juan de la Cruz , Santa Teresa de Jesús , etc.
The Baroque is the most important period for Spanish culture. We are in the times of the Spanish Empire . The famous Don Quijote de La Mancha by Miguel de Cervantes was written in this time. Other writers from the period are: Francisco de Quevedo , Lope de Vega , Calderón de la Barca or Tirso de Molina .
During the Enlightenment we find names such as Leandro Fernández de Moratín , Benito Jerónimo Feijóo , Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos or Leandro Fernández de Moratín .
During the Romanticism , José Zorrilla created one of the most emblematic figures in European literature in Don Juan Tenorio . Other writers from this period are Gustavo Adolfo Bécquer , José de Espronceda , Rosalía de Castro or Mariano José de Larra .
In Realism we find names such as Benito Pérez Galdós , Emilia Pardo Bazán , Leopoldo Alas (Clarín), Concepción Arenal , Vicente Blasco Ibáñez and Menéndez Pelayo . Realism offered depictions of contemporary life and society 'as they were'. In the spirit of general "Realism", Realist authors opted for depictions of everyday and banal activities and experiences, instead of romanticised or stylised presentations.
The group that has become known as the Generation of 1898 was marked by the destruction of Spain's fleet in Cuba by US gunboats in 1898, which provoked a cultural crisis in Spain. The "Disaster" of 1898 led established writers to seek practical political, economic, and social solutions in essays grouped under the literary heading of Regeneracionismo . For a group of younger writers, among them Miguel de Unamuno , Pío Baroja , and José Martínez Ruiz (Azorín), the Disaster and its cultural repercussions inspired a deeper, more radical literary shift that affected both form and content. These writers, along with Ramón del Valle-Inclán , Antonio Machado , Ramiro de Maeztu , and Ángel Ganivet, came to be known as the Generation of '98.
The Generation of 1914 or Novecentismo . The next supposed "generation" of Spanish writers following those of '98 already calls into question the value of such terminology. By the year 1914—the year of the outbreak of the First World War and of the publication of the first major work of the generation's leading voice, José Ortega y Gasset —a number of slightly younger writers had established their own place within the Spanish cultural field.
Leading voices include the poet Juan Ramón Jiménez , the academics and essayists Ramón Menéndez Pidal , Gregorio Marañón , Manuel Azaña , Maria Zambrano , Eugeni d'Ors , Clara Campoamor and Ortega y Gasset, and the novelists Gabriel Miró, Ramón Pérez de Ayala , and Ramón Gómez de la Serna . While still driven by the national and existential questions that obsessed the writers of '98, they approached these topics with a greater sense of distance and objectivity. Salvador de Madariaga , another prominent intellectual and writer, was one of the founders of the College of Europe and the composer of the constitutive manifest of the Liberal International .
The Generation of 1927, where poets Pedro Salinas, Jorge Guillén , Federico García Lorca , Vicente Aleixandre , Dámaso Alonso . All were scholars of their national literary heritage, again evidence of the impact of the calls of regeneracionistas and the Generation of 1898 for Spanish intelligence to turn at least partially inwards.
The two main writers in the second half of the 20th century were the Nobel Prize in Literature laureate Camilo José Cela and Miguel Delibes from Generation of '36 . Spain is one of the countries with the most number of laureates with the Nobel Prize in Literature , and with Latin American laureates they made the Spanish language literature one of the most laureates of all. The Spanish writers are: José Echegaray , Jacinto Benavente , Juan Ramón Jiménez , Vicente Aleixandre and Camilo José Cela . The Portuguese writer José Saramago , also awarded with the prize, lived for many years in Spain and spoke both Portuguese and Spanish. He was also well known by his Iberist ideas.
The Generation of '50 are also known as the children of the civil war. Rosa Chacel , Gloria Fuertes , Jaime Gil de Biedma , Juan Goytisolo , Carmen Martín Gaite , Ana María Matute , Juan Marsé , Blas de Otero , Gabriel Celaya , Antonio Gamoneda , Rafael Sánchez Ferlosio or Ignacio Aldecoa .

Art
Artists from Spain have been highly influential in the development of various European artistic movements . Due to historical, geographical and generational diversity, Spanish art has known a great number of influences. The Moorish heritage in Spain, especially in Andalusia , is still evident today and European influences include Italy, Germany and France, especially during the Baroque and Neoclassical periods.
During the Golden Age we find painters such as El Greco , José de Ribera , Bartolomé Esteban Murillo and Francisco Zurbarán . Also inside Baroque period Diego Velázquez created some of the most famous Spanish portraits, like Las Meninas or Las Hilanderas .
Francisco Goya painted during a historical period that includes the Spanish Independence War , the fights between liberals and absolutists, and the raise of state-nations.
Joaquín Sorolla is a well-known impressionist painter and there are many important Spanish painters belonging to the modernism art movement, including Pablo Picasso , Salvador Dalí , Juan Gris and Joan Miró .

Sculpture
The Plateresque style extended from beginnings of the 16th century until the last third of the century and its stylistic influence pervaded the works of all great Spanish artists of the time. Alonso Berruguete ( Valladolid School) is called the "Prince of Spanish sculpture". His main works were the upper stalls of the choir of the Cathedral of Toledo , the tomb of Cardinal Tavera in the same Cathedral, and the altarpiece of the Visitation in the church of Santa Úrsula in the same locality. Other notable sculptors were Bartolomé Ordóñez , Diego de Siloé , Juan de Juni and Damián Forment .
There were two Schools of special flair and talent: the Seville School , to which Juan Martínez Montañés belonged, whose most celebrated works are the Crucifix in the Cathedral of Seville, another in Vergara, and a Saint John; and the Granada School , to which Alonso Cano belonged, to whom an Immaculate Conception and a Virgin of Rosary, are attributed.
Other notable Andalusian Baroque sculptors were Pedro de Mena , Pedro Roldán and his daughter Luisa Roldán , Juan de Mesa and Pedro Duque Cornejo . In the 20th century the most important Spanish sculptors were Julio González , Pablo Gargallo , Eduardo Chillida and Pablo Serrano .

Cinema
Spanish cinema has achieved major international success including Oscars for recent films such as Pan's Labyrinth and Volver . [191] In the long history of Spanish cinema, the great filmmaker Luis Buñuel was the first to achieve world recognition, followed by Pedro Almodóvar in the 1980s ( La Movida Madrileña ). Mario Camus and Pilar Miró worked together in Curro Jiménez .
Spanish cinema has also seen international success over the years with films by directors like Segundo de Chomón , Florián Rey , Luis García Berlanga , Carlos Saura , Julio Medem , Isabel Coixet , Alejandro Amenábar , Icíar Bollaín and brothers David Trueba and Fernando Trueba .
Actresses Sara Montiel and Penélope Cruz or actor Antonio Banderas are among those who have become Hollywood stars.

Architecture
Due to its historical and geographical diversity, Spanish architecture has drawn from a host of influences. An important provincial city founded by the Romans and with an extensive Roman era infrastructure, Córdoba became the cultural capital, including fine Arabic style architecture, during the time of the Islamic Umayyad dynasty . [192] Later Arab style architecture continued to be developed under successive Islamic dynasties, ending with the Nasrid , which built its famed palace complex in Granada .
Simultaneously, the Christian kingdoms gradually emerged and developed their own styles; developing a pre-Romanesque style when for a while isolated from contemporary mainstream European architectural influences during the earlier Middle Ages, they later integrated the Romanesque and Gothic streams. There was then an extraordinary flowering of the Gothic style that resulted in numerous instances being built throughout the entire territory. The Mudéjar style, from the 12th to 17th centuries, was developed by introducing Arab style motifs, patterns and elements into European architecture.
The arrival of Modernism in the academic arena produced much of the architecture of the 20th century. An influential style centred in Barcelona , known as modernisme , produced a number of important architects, of which Gaudí is one. The International style was led by groups like GATEPAC . Spain is currently experiencing a revolution in contemporary architecture and Spanish architects like Rafael Moneo , Santiago Calatrava , Ricardo Bofill as well as many others have gained worldwide renown.

Music and dance
Spanish music is often considered abroad to be synonymous with flamenco , a West Andalusian musical genre, which, contrary to popular belief, is not widespread outside that region. Various regional styles of folk music abound in Aragon, Catalonia, Valencia, Castile, the Basque Country, Galicia, Cantabria and Asturias. Pop, rock, hip hop and heavy metal are also popular.
In the field of classical music , Spain has produced a number of noted composers such as Isaac Albéniz , Manuel de Falla and Enrique Granados and singers and performers such as Plácido Domingo , José Carreras , Montserrat Caballé , Alicia de Larrocha , Alfredo Kraus , Pablo Casals , Ricardo Viñes , José Iturbi , Pablo de Sarasate , Jordi Savall and Teresa Berganza . In Spain there are over forty professional orchestras, including the Orquestra Simfònica de Barcelona , Orquesta Nacional de España and the Orquesta Sinfónica de Madrid . Major opera houses include the Teatro Real , the Gran Teatre del Liceu , Teatro Arriaga and the El Palau de les Arts Reina Sofía .
Thousands of music fans also travel to Spain each year for internationally recognised summer music festivals Sónar which often features the top up and coming pop and techno acts, and Benicàssim which tends to feature alternative rock and dance acts. [193] Both festivals mark Spain as an international music presence and reflect the tastes of young people in the country.
The most popular traditional musical instrument , the guitar , originated in Spain. [194] Typical of the north are the traditional bag pipers or gaiteros , mainly in Asturias and Galicia.

Cuisine
Spanish cuisine consists of a great variety of dishes which stem from differences in geography, culture and climate. It is heavily influenced by seafood available from the waters that surround the country, and reflects the country's deep Mediterranean roots. Spain's extensive history with many cultural influences has led to a unique cuisine. In particular, three main divisions are easily identified:
Mediterranean Spain – all such coastal regions, from Catalonia to Andalusia – heavy use of seafood, such as pescaíto frito (fried fish); several cold soups like gazpacho ; and many rice-based dishes like paella from Valencia [195] and arròs negre (black rice) from Catalonia. [196]
Inner Spain – Castile – hot, thick soups such as the bread and garlic-based Castilian soup , along with substantious stews such as cocido madrileño . Food is traditionally conserved by salting, like Spanish ham , or immersed in olive oil , like Manchego cheese .
Atlantic Spain – the whole Northern coast, including Asturian , Basque , Cantabrian and Galician cuisine – vegetable and fish-based stews like caldo gallego and marmitako . Also, the lightly cured lacón ham. The best known cuisine of the northern countries often rely on ocean seafood, like the Basque-style cod , albacore or anchovy or the Galician octopus-based polbo á feira and shellfish dishes.

Sport
While varieties of football had been played in Spain as far back as Roman times, sport in Spain has been dominated by English style association football since the early 20th century. Real Madrid C.F. and FC Barcelona are two of the most successful football clubs in the world. The country's national football team won the UEFA European Football Championship in 1964, 2008 and 2012 and the FIFA World Cup in 2010 , and is the first team to ever win three back-to-back major international tournaments.
Basketball , tennis , cycling , handball , futsal , motorcycling and, lately, Formula One are also important due to the presence of Spanish champions in all these disciplines. Today, Spain is a major world sports powerhouse, especially since the 1992 Summer Olympics that were hosted in Barcelona , which stimulated a great deal of interest in sports in the country. The tourism industry has led to an improvement in sports infrastructure, especially for water sports , golf and skiing .
Rafael Nadal is the leading Spanish tennis player and has won several Grand Slam titles including the Wimbledon 2010 men's singles. In north Spain, the game of pelota is very popular. Alberto Contador is the leading Spanish cyclist and has won several Grand Tour titles including two Tour de France titles.

Public holidays and festivals
Public holidays celebrated in Spain include a mix of religious ( Roman Catholic ), national and regional observances. Each municipality is allowed to declare a maximum of 14 public holidays per year; up to nine of these are chosen by the national government and at least two are chosen locally. [197] Spain's National Day ( Fiesta Nacional de España ) is 12 October, the anniversary of the Discovery of America and commemorate Our Lady of the Pillar feast, patroness of Aragon and throughout Spain.
There are many festivals and festivities in Spain. Some of them are known worldwide, and every year millions of people from all over the world go to Spain to experience one of these festivals. One of the most famous is San Fermín , in Pamplona . While its most famous event is the encierro , or the running of the bulls , which happens at 8:00 am from 7 to 14 July, the week-long celebration involves many other traditional and folkloric events. Its events were central to the plot of The Sun Also Rises, by Ernest Hemingway , which brought it to the general attention of English-speaking people. As a result, it has become one of the most internationally renowned fiestas in Spain, with over 1,000,000 people attending every year.
Other festivals include the carnivals in the Canary Islands , the Falles in Valencia or the Holy Week in Andalusia and Castile and León .

The New York Times
The New York Times (sometimes abbreviated NYT and The Times ) is an American daily newspaper , founded and continuously published in New York City since September 18, 1851, by The New York Times Company . The New York Times has won 122 Pulitzer Prizes , more than any other newspaper. [5] [6] [7] [8]
The paper's print version in 2013 had the second-largest circulation, behind The Wall Street Journal , and the largest circulation among the metropolitan newspapers in the United States. The New York Times is ranked 18th in the world by circulation . Following industry trends, its weekday circulation had fallen in 2009 to fewer than one million. [9]
Nicknamed " The Gray Lady ", [10] The New York Times has long been regarded within the industry as a national " newspaper of record ". [11] It has been owned by the Ochs-Sulzberger family since 1896; Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr. , the publisher of the Times and the chairman of the New York Times Company, is the fourth generation of the family to helm the paper. [12] The New York Times international version, formerly the International Herald Tribune , is now called the New York Times International Edition . [13]
The paper's motto, "All the News That's Fit to Print", appears in the upper left-hand corner of the front page. Since the mid-1970s, The New York Times has greatly expanded its layout and organization, adding special weekly sections on various topics supplementing the regular news, editorials, sports, and features. Since 2008, [14] The New York Times has been organized into the following sections: News, Editorials/Opinions-Columns/Op-Ed, New York (metropolitan), Business, Sports of The Times, Arts, Science, Styles, Home, Travel, and other features. [15]
On Sunday, The New York Times is supplemented by the Sunday Review (formerly the Week in Review ), [16] The New York Times Book Review , [17] The New York Times Magazine [18] and T: The New York Times Style Magazine (T is published 13 times a year). [19] The New York Times stayed with the broadsheet full page set-up (as some others have changed into a tabloid lay-out) and an eight-column format for several years, after most papers switched to six, [20] and was one of the last newspapers to adopt color photography , especially on the front page. [21]

History

Newspaper history
The New York Times was founded as the New-York Daily Times on September 18, 1851, [a] published by Raymond, Jones & Company (raising about $70,000); [23] by journalist and politician Henry Jarvis Raymond (1820–69), then a Whig Party member and later second chairman of the newly organized Republican Party National Committee , and former banker George Jones . Some other early investors of the company were Edwin B. Morgan [24] and Edward B. Wesley. [25] Sold for a penny (equivalent to 29 cents today), the inaugural edition attempted to address various speculations on its purpose and positions that preceded its release: [26]
In 1852, the newspaper started a western division, The Times of California that arrived whenever a mail boat got to California. However, when local California newspapers came into prominence, the effort failed. [27]
The newspaper shortened its name to The New-York Times in 1857. It dropped the hyphen in the city name in the 1890s. [28] On April 21, 1861, The New York Times departed from its original Monday–Saturday publishing schedule and joined other major dailies in adding a Sunday edition to offer daily coverage of the Civil War . One of the earliest public controversies it was involved with was the Mortara Affair , the subject of twenty editorials it published alone. [29]
The main office of The New York Times was attacked during the New York Draft Riots sparked by the beginning of military conscription for the Northern Union Army now instituted in the midst of the Civil War on July 13, 1863. At "Newspaper Row", across from City Hall , Henry Raymond , owner and editor of The New York Times , averted the rioters with " Gatling " (early machine, rapid-firing) guns, one of which he manned himself. The mob now diverted, instead attacked the headquarters of abolitionist publisher Horace Greeley 's New York Tribune until forced to flee by the Brooklyn City Police , who had crossed the East River to help the Manhattan authorities. [30]
In 1869, Raymond died, and George Jones took over as publisher. [31]
The newspaper's influence grew during 1870–1 when it published a series of exposés on William Magear ("Boss") Tweed , leader of the city's Democratic Party—popularly known as " Tammany Hall " (from its early 19th Century meeting headquarters)—that led to the end of the "Tweed Ring's" domination of New York's City Hall. [32] Tweed offered The New York Times five million dollars (equivalent to more than 100 million dollars today) to not publish the story. [24] In the 1880s, The New York Times transitioned gradually from editorially supporting Republican Party candidates to becoming more politically independent and analytical. [33] In 1884, the paper supported Democrat Grover Cleveland (former Mayor of Buffalo and Governor of New York State ) in his first presidential campaign . [34] While this move cost The New York Times ' readership among its more progressive and Republican readers (the revenue went down from $188,000 to $56,000 from 1883-4- however some part of this was due to the price going down to two cents, in order to compete with the World and Sun ) , the paper eventually regained most of its lost ground within a few years. [35] After George Jones died in 1891, Charles Ransom Miller raised $1 million dollars to buy the Times, along with other fellow editors at the newspaper, printing it under the New York Times Publishing Company. [36] [37] However, the newspaper was financially crippled by the Panic of 1893 . [35] By 1896, The New York Times had a circulation of less than 9,000, and was losing $1,000 a day when controlling interest in it was gained by Adolph Ochs , publisher of the Chattanooga Times for $75,000. [38]
Shortly after assuming control of the paper, Ochs coined the paper's slogan, "All The News That's Fit To Print". The slogan has appeared in the paper since September 1896, [39] and has been printed in a box in the upper left hand corner of the front page since early 1897. [34] This was a jab at competing papers such as Joseph Pulitzer 's New York World and William Randolph Hearst 's New York Journal which were now being known for a lurid, sensationalist and often inaccurate reporting of facts and opinions known by the end of the century as " yellow journalism ". [40] Under Ochs' guidance, continuing and expanding upon the Henry Raymond tradition, (which were from the era of James Gordon Bennett of the New York Herald which predated Pulitzer and Hearst's arrival in New York), The New York Times achieved international scope, circulation, and reputation (the Sunday circulation went from 9,000 in 1896 to 780,000 in 1934). [38] In 1904, The New York Times , along with The Times received the first on-the-spot wireless telegraph transmission from a naval battle, a report of the destruction of the Imperial Russian Navy 's Baltic Fleet at the Battle of Port Arthur in the Straits of Tsushima off the eastern coast of Korea in the Yellow Sea in the western Pacific Ocean after just sailing across the globe from Europe from the press-boat Haimun during the Russo-Japanese War . [41] In 1910, the first air delivery of The New York Times to Philadelphia began. [34] The New York Times ' first trans-Atlantic delivery by air to London occurred in 1919 by dirigible. In 1920, a "4 A.M. Airplane Edition" was sent by plane to Chicago so it could be in the hands of Republican convention delegates by evening. [42]
In the 1940s, the paper extended its breadth and reach. The crossword began appearing regularly in 1942, and the fashion section in 1946. The New York Times began an international edition in 1946. The international edition stopped publishing in 1967, when The New York Times joined the owners of the New York Herald Tribune and The Washington Post to publish the International Herald Tribune in Paris. The paper bought AM radio station WQXR (1560 kHz) in 1944. [43] Its "sister" FM station, WQXQ, would become WQXR-FM (96.3 MHz). Branded as "The Radio Stations of The New York Times ", its classical music radio format was simulcast on both the AM & FM frequencies until December 1992, when the big-band and pop standards music format of station WNEW (1130 kHz – now WBBR /"Bloomberg Radio") was transferred to and adopted by WQXR; in recognition of the format change, WQXR changed its call letters to WQEW (a "hybrid" combination of " WQ XR" and "WN EW "). [44] By 1999, The New York Times was leasing WQEW to ABC Radio for its " Radio Disney " format. [45] In 2007, WQEW was finally purchased by Disney ; in late 2014, it was sold to Family Radio (a religious radio network) and became WFME . [46] On July 14, 2009, it was announced that WQXR-FM would be sold to the WNYC radio group who, on October 8, 2009, moved the station from 96.3 to 105.9 MHz (swapping frequencies with Spanish-language station WXNY-FM , which wanted the more powerful transmitter to increase its coverage) and began operating it as a non-commercial, public radio station. [47] After the purchase, WQXR-FM retained the classical music format, whereas WNYC-FM (93.9 MHz) abandoned it, switching to a talk radio format.
On September 14, 1987, the Times printed the heaviest ever newspaper, at over 12 pounds (5.4 kg) and 1,612 pages. [48]
In 2009, the newspaper began production of local inserts in regions outside of the New York area. Beginning October 16, 2009, a two-page "Bay Area" insert was added to copies of the Northern California edition on Fridays and Sundays. The newspaper commenced production of a similar Friday and Sunday insert to the Chicago edition on November 20, 2009. The inserts consist of local news, policy, sports, and culture pieces, usually supported by local advertisements.
In addition to its New York City headquarters, the newspaper has ten news bureaus in the New York region, eleven national news bureaus and 26 foreign news bureaus. [49] The New York Times reduced its page width to 12 inches (300 mm) from 13.5 inches (340 mm) on August 6, 2007, adopting the width that has become the U.S. newspaper industry standard. [50]
Because of its steadily declining sales attributed to the rise of online alternative media and social media , the newspaper has been going through a downsizing for several years, offering buyouts to workers and cutting expenses, [51] in common with a general trend among print news media. [52]
In 2016, reporters for the newspaper were reportedly the target of cyber security breaches. The Federal Bureau of Investigation was reportedly investigating the attacks. The cyber security breaches have been described as possibly being related to cyberattacks that targeted other institutions, such as the Democratic National Committee . [53]

Headquarters building
The newspaper's first building was located at 113 Nassau Street in New York City. In 1854, it moved to 138 Nassau Street, and in 1858 to 41 Park Row , making it the first newspaper in New York City housed in a building built specifically for its use. [54]
The newspaper moved its headquarters to the Times Tower, located at 1475 Broadway in 1904, [55] in an area called Longacre Square, that was later renamed Times Square in honor of the newspaper. [56] The top of the building –  now known as One Times Square –  is the site of the New Year's Eve tradition of lowering a lighted ball , which was started by the paper. [57] The building is also notable for its electronic news ticker –  popularly known as "The Zipper" –  where headlines crawl around the outside of the building. [58] It is still in use, but has been operated by Dow Jones & Company since 1995. [59] After nine years in its Times Square tower the newspaper had an annex built at 229 West 43rd Street . [60] After several expansions, the 43rd Street building became the newspaper's main headquarters in 1960 and the Times Tower on Broadway was sold the following year. [61] It served as the newspaper's main printing plant until 1997, when the newspaper opened a state-of-the-art printing plant in the College Point section of the borough of Queens . [62]
A decade later, The New York Times moved its newsroom and businesses headquarters from West 43rd Street to a new tower at 620 Eighth Avenue between West 40th and 41st Streets, in Manhattan –  directly across Eighth Avenue from the Port Authority Bus Terminal . The new headquarters for the newspaper, known officially as The New York Times Building but unofficially called the new "Times Tower" by many New Yorkers, is a skyscraper designed by Renzo Piano . [63] [64]

New York Times v. Sullivan
The paper's involvement in a 1964 libel case helped bring one of the key United States Supreme Court decisions supporting freedom of the press , New York Times Co. v. Sullivan . In it, the United States Supreme Court established the " actual malice " standard for press reports about public officials or public figures to be considered defamatory or libelous . The malice standard requires the plaintiff in a defamation or libel case prove the publisher of the statement knew the statement was false or acted in reckless disregard of its truth or falsity. Because of the high burden of proof on the plaintiff, and difficulty in proving malicious intent, such cases by public figures rarely succeed. [65]

The 
In 1971, the Pentagon Papers , a secret United States Department of Defense history of the United States' political and military involvement in the Vietnam War from 1945 to 1967, were given ("leaked") to Neil Sheehan of The New York Times by former State Department official Daniel Ellsberg , with his friend Anthony Russo assisting in copying them. The New York Times began publishing excerpts as a series of articles on June 13. Controversy and lawsuits followed. The papers revealed, among other things, that the government had deliberately expanded its role in the war by conducting air strikes over Laos , raids along the coast of North Vietnam , and offensive actions taken by U.S. Marines well before the public was told about the actions, all while President Lyndon B. Johnson had been promising not to expand the war. The document increased the credibility gap for the U.S. government, and hurt efforts by the Nixon administration to fight the ongoing war. [66]
When The New York Times began publishing its series, President Richard Nixon became incensed. His words to National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger included "People have gotta be put to the torch for this sort of thing..." and "Let's get the son-of-a-bitch in jail." [67] After failing to get The New York Times to stop publishing, Attorney General John Mitchell and President Nixon obtained a federal court injunction that The New York Times cease publication of excerpts. The newspaper appealed and the case began working through the court system. On June 18, 1971, The Washington Post began publishing its own series. Ben Bagdikian , a Post editor, had obtained portions of the papers from Ellsberg. That day the Post received a call from the Assistant Attorney General, William Rehnquist , asking them to stop publishing. When the Post refused, the U.S. Justice Department sought another injunction. The U.S. District court judge refused, and the government appealed. On June 26, 1971, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to take both cases, merging them into New York Times Co. v. United States 403 US 713. On June 30, 1971, the Supreme Court held in a 6–3 decision that the injunctions were unconstitutional prior restraints and that the government had not met the burden of proof required. The justices wrote nine separate opinions, disagreeing on significant substantive issues. While it was generally seen as a victory for those who claim the First Amendment enshrines an absolute right to free speech , many felt it a lukewarm victory, offering little protection for future publishers when claims of national security were at stake. [66]

Discrimination in employment
Discriminatory practices restricting women in editorial positions were previously used by the paper. The newspaper's first general woman reporter was Jane Grant , who described her experience afterwards. She wrote, "In the beginning I was charged not to reveal the fact that a female had been hired". Other reporters nicknamed her Fluff and she was subjected to considerable hazing . Because of her gender , promotions were out of the question, according to the then-managing editor. She was there for fifteen years, interrupted by World War I. [68]
In 1935, Anne McCormick wrote to Arthur Hays Sulzberger , "I hope you won't expect me to revert to 'woman's-point-of-view' stuff." [69] Later, she interviewed major political leaders and appears to have had easier access than her colleagues did. Even those who witnessed her in action were unable to explain how she got the interviews she did. [70] Clifton Daniel said, "[After World War II,] I'm sure Adenauer called her up and invited her to lunch. She never had to grovel for an appointment." [71] Covering world leaders' speeches after World War II at the National Press Club was limited to men by a Club rule. When women were eventually allowed in to hear the speeches, they still were not allowed to ask the speakers questions, although men were allowed and did ask, even though some of the women had won Pulitzer Prizes for prior work. [72] Times reporter Maggie Hunter refused to return to the Club after covering one speech on assignment. [73] Nan Robertson 's article on the Union Stock Yards , Chicago , was read aloud as anonymous by a professor, who then said, "'It will come as a surprise to you, perhaps, that the reporter is a girl,' he began... [G]asps; amazement in the ranks. 'She had used all her senses, not just her eyes, to convey the smell and feel of the stockyards. She chose a difficult subject, an offensive subject. Her imagery was strong enough to revolt you.'" [74] The New York Times hired Kathleen McLaughlin after ten years at the Chicago Tribune , where "[s]he did a series on maids, going out herself to apply for housekeeping jobs." [75]

Snow Fall
The New York Times published on December 20, 2012, an interactive storytelling in longform multimedia, Snow Fall : The Avalanche at Tunnel Creek by reporter John Branch about the 2012 Tunnel Creek avalanche . The six-part story, which integrated video, photos, and graphics, was hailed as a watershed moment for the journalism industry. [76] [77] The feature was awarded a Peabody Award , which called the piece a "spectacular example of the potential of digital-age storytelling" which "combines thorough traditional reporting of a deadly avalanche with stunning topographic video." [78] Snow Fall inspired the Times to appoint Sam Sifton "Snowfaller in Chief," expanding multimedia narratives in the newsroom in the tradition of Snow Fall. [79]

Recent history
In February 2013, the paper stopped offering lifelong positions for its journalists and editors. [80] [ relevant? – discuss ]

Ownership
In 1896, Adolph Ochs bought The New York Times , a money-losing newspaper, and formed the New York Times Company. The Ochs-Sulzberger family, one of the United States' newspaper dynasties, has owned The New York Times ever since. [34] The publisher went public on January 14, 1969, trading at $42 a share on the American Stock Exchange . [81] After this, the family continued to exert control through its ownership of the vast majority of Class B voting shares . Class A shareholders are permitted restrictive voting rights while Class B shareholders are allowed open voting rights.
The Ochs-Sulzberger family trust controls roughly 88 percent of the company's class B shares. Any alteration to the dual-class structure must be ratified by six of eight directors who sit on the board of the Ochs-Sulzberger family trust. The Trust board members are Daniel H. Cohen, James M. Cohen, Lynn G. Dolnick, Susan W. Dryfoos, Michael Golden, Eric M. A. Lax, Arthur O. Sulzberger, Jr. and Cathy J. Sulzberger. [82]
Turner Catledge , the top editor at The New York Times from 1952 to 1968, wanted to hide the ownership influence. Arthur Sulzberger routinely wrote memos to his editor, each containing suggestions, instructions, complaints, and orders. When Catledge would receive these memos he would erase the publisher's identity before passing them to his subordinates. Catledge thought that if he removed the publisher's name from the memos it would protect reporters from feeling pressured by the owner. [83]

Carlos Slim loan and investment
On January 20, 2009, The New York Times reported that its parent company, The New York Times Company, had reached an agreement to borrow $250 million from Carlos Slim , a Mexican businessman and the world's second richest person, [84] "to help the newspaper company finance its businesses". [85] The New York Times Company later repaid that loan ahead of schedule. [86] Since then, Slim has bought large quantities of the company's Class A shares, which are available for purchase by the public and offer less control over the company than Class B shares, which are privately held. [86] Slim's investments in the company included large purchases of Class A shares in 2011, when he increased his stake in the company to 8.1% of Class A shares, [87] and again in 2015, when he exercised stock options—acquired as part of a repayment plan on the 2009 loan—to purchase 15.9 million Class A shares. [86] As of March 7, 2016, Slim owned 17.4% of the company's Class A shares, according to annual filings submitted by the company. [88] [89]
Although Slim is the largest shareholder in the company, his investment does not give him the ability to control the newspaper, as his stake allows him to vote only for Class A directors, who compose just a third of the company's board. [86] According to the company's 2016 annual filings, Slim did not own any of the company's Class B shares. [88]

Dual-class shares
Dual-class structures caught on in the mid-20th century as families such as the Grahams of The Washington Post Company sought to gain access to public capital without losing control. Dow Jones & Co. , publisher of The Wall Street Journal , had a similar structure and was controlled by the Bancroft family but was later bought by News Corporation in 2007, which itself is controlled by Rupert Murdoch and his family through a similar dual-class structure. [90]

Content

Sections
The newspaper is organized in three sections, including the magazine.
Some sections, such as Metro, are only found in the editions of the paper distributed in the New York–New Jersey–Connecticut Tri-State Area and not in the national or Washington, D.C. editions. [91] Aside from a weekly roundup of reprints of editorial cartoons from other newspapers, The New York Times does not have its own staff editorial cartoonist , nor does it feature a comics page or Sunday comics section. [92] In September 2008, The New York Times announced that it would be combining certain sections effective October 6, 2008, in editions printed in the New York metropolitan area. The changes folded the Metro Section into the main International / National news section and combined Sports and Business (except Saturday through Monday, when Sports is still printed as a standalone section). This change also included having the name of the Metro section be called New York outside of the Tri-State Area. The presses used by The New York Times allow four sections to be printed simultaneously; as the paper had included more than four sections all days except Saturday, the sections had to be printed separately in an early press run and collated together. The changes will allow The New York Times to print in four sections Monday through Wednesday, in addition to Saturday. The New York Times ' announcement stated that the number of news pages and employee positions will remain unchanged, with the paper realizing cost savings by cutting overtime expenses. [14] According to Russ Stanton, editor of the Los Angeles Times , a competitor, the newsroom of The New York Times is twice the size of the Los Angeles Times , which has a newsroom of 600. [93] In March 2014, Vanessa Friedman was named the "fashion director and chief fashion critic" of The New York Times . [94]

Style
When referring to people, The New York Times generally uses honorifics , rather than unadorned last names (except in the sports pages, Book Review and Magazine). [95] It stayed with an eight-column format until September 7, 1976, years after other papers had switched to six, [20] and it was one of the last newspapers to adopt color photography, with the first color photograph on the front page appearing on October 16, 1997. [21] In the absence of a major headline, the day's most important story generally appears in the top-right column, on the main page. The typefaces used for the headlines are custom variations of Cheltenham . The running text is set at 8.7 point Imperial . [96] [97]
Joining a roster of other major American newspapers in the last ten years, including USA Today , The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post , The New York Times announced on July 18, 2006, that it would be narrowing the width of its paper by six inches. In an era of dwindling circulation and significant advertising revenue losses for most print versions of American newspapers, the move, which would result in a five percent reduction in news coverage, would have a target savings of $12 million a year for the paper. [98] The change from the traditional 54 inches (1.4 m) broadsheet style to a more compact 48-inch web width (12-inch page width) was addressed by both Executive Editor Bill Keller and The New York Times President Scott Heekin-Canedy in memos to the staff. Keller defended the "more reader-friendly" move indicating that in cutting out the "flabby or redundant prose in longer pieces" the reduction would make for a better paper. Similarly, Keller confronted the challenges of covering news with "less room" by proposing more "rigorous editing" and promised an ongoing commitment to "hard-hitting, ground-breaking journalism". [99] The official change went into effect on August 6, 2007. [100]
The New York Times printed a display advertisement on its first page on January 6, 2009, breaking tradition at the paper. [101] The advertisement, for CBS, was in color and ran the entire width of the page. [102] The newspaper promised it would place first-page advertisements on only the lower half of the page. [101]
In August 2014, The Times decided to use the word " torture " to describe incidents in which interrogators "inflicted pain on a prisoner in an effort to get information." This was a shift from the paper's previous practice of describe such practices as "harsh" or "brutal" interrogations. [103]
The paper maintains a strict profanity policy. A 2007 review of a concert by punk band Fucked Up , for example, completely avoided mention of the group's name. [104] However, the Times has on occasion published unfiltered video content that includes profanity and slurs where it has determined that such video has news value. [105] During the 2016 U.S. presidential election campaign, the Times did print the words "fuck" and "pussy," among others, when reporting on the vulgar statements made by Donald Trump in a 2005 recording . Times politics editor Carolyn Ryan said: "It's a rare thing for us to use this language in our stories, even in quotes, and we discussed it at length," ultimately deciding to publish it because of its news value and because "[t]o leave it out or simply describe it seemed awkward and less than forthright to us, especially given that we would be running a video that showed our readers exactly what was said." [106]

Awards
The New York Times has won 122 Pulitzer Prizes , more than any other newspaper. The prize is awarded for excellence in journalism in a range of categories. [5]
It has also won three Peabody Awards (and jointly received two). A Peabody award was given in 2003 for the documentary Frontline: A Dangerous Business, a joint investigation by the New York Times , the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation , and WGBH 's Frontline about the conditions faced by workers at McWayne Inc. [107] The newspaper won another Peabody award (in 1951) for the New York Times Youth Forum (which featured "unrehearsed discussion by students selected from private, public and parochial schools, on topics ranging from the political, educational and scientific to the international and the United Nations.") [108] Again in 2008, the newspaper won another reward for "Aggressively and creatively adding sound and moving images to its traditional package of news and features, The New York Times has stepped forward as an innovator in online journalism. Its website exemplifies a new age for the press, expanding its role in ways unimaginable only a few years ago." [109] In 2013, the Times, along with The National Film Board of Canada won a Peabody Award for the documentary "A Short History of the Highrise". [110] A personal award was also given to then chief media critic Jack Gould in 1956. [111]

Web presence
The New York Times began publishing daily on the World Wide Web on January 22, 1996, "offering readers around the world immediate access to most of the daily newspaper's contents." [112] Since its online launch, the newspaper has consistently been ranked one of the top websites. Accessing some articles requires registration, though this could be bypassed in some cases through Times RSS feeds. [113] The website had 555 million pageviews in March 2005. [114] The domain nytimes.com attracted at least 146 million visitors annually by 2008 according to a Compete.com study. The New York Times Web site ranks 59th by number of unique visitors, with over 20 million unique visitors in March 2009 making it the most visited newspaper site with more than twice the number of unique visitors as the next most popular site. [115] as of May 2009 [update] , nytimes.com produced 22 of the 50 most popular newspaper blogs. [116] NYTimes.com is ranked 129 in the world, and 27 in the U.S. by Alexa (as of March 12, 2017). [117]
In September 2005, the paper decided to begin subscription-based service for daily columns in a program known as TimesSelect , which encompassed many previously free columns. Until being discontinued two years later, TimesSelect cost $7.95 per month or $49.95 per year, [118] though it was free for print copy subscribers and university students and faculty. [119] [120] To avoid this charge, bloggers often reposted TimesSelect material, [121] and at least one site once compiled links of reprinted material. [122] On September 17, 2007, The New York Times announced that it would stop charging for access to parts of its Web site, effective at midnight the following day, reflecting a growing view in the industry that subscription fees cannot outweigh the potential ad revenue from increased traffic on a free site. [123] In addition to opening almost the entire site to all readers, The New York Times news archives from 1987 to the present are available at no charge, as well as those from 1851 to 1922, which are in the public domain. [124] [125] Access to the Premium Crosswords section continues to require either home delivery or a subscription for $6.95 per month or $39.95 per year. Times columnists including Nicholas Kristof and Thomas Friedman had criticized TimesSelect , [126] [127] with Friedman going so far as to say "I hate it. It pains me enormously because it's cut me off from a lot, a lot of people, especially because I have a lot of people reading me overseas, like in India ... I feel totally cut off from my audience." [128]
The New York Times was made available on the iPhone and iPod Touch in 2008, [129] and on the iPad mobile devices in 2010. [130] It was also the first newspaper to offer a video game as part of its editorial content, Food Import Folly by Persuasive Games . [131] In 2010, The New York Times editors collaborated with students and faculty from New York University 's Studio 20 Journalism Masters program to launch and produce "The Local East Village", a hyperlocal blog designed to offer news "by, for and about the residents of the East Village". [132] That same year, reCAPTCHA helped to digitize old editions of The New York Times . [133]
In 2012, The New York Times introduced a Chinese-language news site, cn.nytimes.com, with content created by staff based in Shanghai , Beijing and Hong Kong , though the server was placed outside of China to avoid censorship issues. [134] In March 2013, The New York Times and National Film Board of Canada announced a partnership entitled A Short History of the Highrise , which will create four short documentaries for the Internet about life in highrise buildings as part of the NFB's Highrise project, utilizing images from the newspaper's photo archives for the first three films, and user-submitted images for the final film. [135] The third project in the series, "A Short History of the Highrise", won a Peabody Award in 2013. [136]
Falling print advertising revenue and projections of continued decline resulted in a paywall being instituted in 2011, regarded as modestly successful after garnering several hundred thousand subscriptions and about $100 million in revenue as of March 2012 [update] . [137] The paywall was announced on March 17, 2011, that starting on March 28, 2011 (March 17, 2011, for Canada), it would charge frequent readers for access to its online content. [138] Readers would be able to access up to 20 articles each month without charge. (Although beginning in April 2012, the number of free-access articles was halved to just ten articles per month.) Any reader who wanted to access more would have to pay for a digital subscription. This plan would allow free access for occasional readers, but produce revenue from "heavy" readers. Digital subscriptions rates for four weeks range from $15 to $35 depending on the package selected, with periodic new subscriber promotions offering four-week all-digital access for as low as 99¢. Subscribers to the paper's print edition get full access without any additional fee. Some content, such as the front page and section fronts will remain free, as well as the Top News page on mobile apps. [139] In January 2013, The New York Times ' Public Editor Margaret M. Sullivan announced that for the first time in many decades, the paper generated more revenue through subscriptions than through advertising. [140]
The newspaper's website was hacked on August 29, 2013, by the Syrian Electronic Army , a hacking group that supports the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad . The SEA managed to penetrate the paper's domain name registrar , Melbourne IT , and alter DNS records for The New York Times , putting some of its websites out of service for hours. [141]
The food section is supplemented on the web by properties for home cooks and for out-of-home dining. New York Times Cooking (cooking.nytimes.com; also available via iOS app) provides access to more than 17,000 recipes on file as of November 2016, [142] and availability of saving recipes from other sites around the web. The newspaper's restaurant search (nytimes.com/reviews/dining) allows online readers to search NYC area restaurants by cuisine, neighborhood, price, and reviewer rating. The New York Times has also published several cookbooks, including The Essential New York Times Cookbook: Classic Recipes for a New Century , published in late 2010.

Mobile presence
The Times Reader is a digital version of The New York Times . It was created via a collaboration between the newspaper and Microsoft . Times Reader takes the principles of print journalism and applies them to the technique of online reporting. Times Reader uses a series of technologies developed by Microsoft and their Windows Presentation Foundation team. It was announced in Seattle in April 2006, by Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr. , Bill Gates , and Tom Bodkin . [143] In 2009, the Times Reader 2.0 was rewritten in Adobe AIR . [144] In December 2013, the newspaper announced that the Times Reader app would be discontinued on January 6, 2014, urging readers of the app to instead begin using the subscription-only "Today's Paper" app. [145]
In 2008, The New York Times created an app for the iPhone and iPod Touch which allowed users to download articles to their mobile device enabling them to read the paper even when they were unable to receive a signal. [146] In April 2010, The New York Times announced it would begin publishing daily content through an iPad app. [147] As of October 2010 [update] , The New York Times iPad app is ad-supported and available for free without a paid subscription, but translated into a subscription-based model in 2011. [130]
In 2010, the newspaper also launched an app for Android smartphones, followed later by an app for Windows Phones . [148]

Podcasts
The New York Times began producing podcasts in 2006. Among the early podcasts were Inside The Times and Inside The New York Times Book Review . Several of the Times podcasts were cancelled in 2012. [149] [150] The Times returned to launching new podcasts in 2016, including Modern Love with WBUR . [151] On January 30, 2017, The New York Times launched a new podcast The Daily . [152] [153]

Chinese-language version
In June 2012, The New York Times launched its first official foreign-language variant, cn.nytimes.com, in Chinese , [154] viewable in both traditional and simplified Chinese characters . The project was led by Craig S. Smith on the business side and Philip P. Pan on the editorial side.
The site's initial success was interrupted in October that year following the publication of an investigative article [b] by David Barboza about the finances of Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao 's family. [155] In retaliation for the article, the Chinese government blocked access to both nytimes.com and cn.nytimes.com inside the People's Republic of China (PRC).
Despite Chinese government interference, however, the Chinese-language operations have continued to develop, adding a second site, cn.nytstyle.com, iOS and Android apps and newsletters, all of which are accessible inside the PRC. The China operations also produce three print publications in Chinese. Traffic to cn.nytimes.com, meanwhile, has risen due to the widespread use of VPN technology in the PRC and to a growing Chinese audience outside mainland China. [156] New York Times articles are also available to users in China via the use of mirror websites , apps, domestic newspapers, and social media . [156] [157] The Chinese platforms now represent one of The New York Times ' top five digital markets globally. The editor-in-chief of the Chinese platforms is Ching-Ching Ni . [158]

Reporter resources
The website's "Newsroom Navigator" collects online resources for use by reporters and editors. It is maintained by Rich Meislin. [159] [160] [161] Further specific collections are available to cover the subjects of business, politics and health. [159] [162] [163] In 1998, Meislin was editor-in-chief of electronic media at the newspaper. [164]

Interruptions
Because of holidays, no editions were printed on November 23, 1851; January 2, 1852; July 4, 1852; January 2, 1853; and January 1, 1854. [165]
Because of strikes , the regular edition of The New York Times was not printed during the following periods: [166]

Editorial stance
The New York Times editorial page is often regarded as liberal. [169] [170] In mid-2004, the newspaper's then public editor ( ombudsman ), Daniel Okrent , wrote that "the Op-Ed page editors do an evenhanded job of representing a range of views in the essays from outsiders they publish – but you need an awfully heavy counterweight to balance a page that also bears the work of seven opinionated columnists, only two of whom could be classified as conservative (and, even then, of the conservative subspecies that supports legalization of gay unions and, in the case of William Safire , opposes some central provisions of the Patriot Act." [171]
The New York Times has not endorsed a Republican for president since Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1956; since 1960, it has endorsed the Democratic nominee in every presidential election (see New York Times presidential endorsements ). [172] However, the Times did endorse incumbent Republican Mayors of New York City Rudy Giuliani in 1997 [173] and Michael Bloomberg in 2005 [174] and 2009. [175] The Times also endorsed Republican Governor George Pataki in 2002. [176]

Coverage issues

Iraq War
The New York Times supported the 2003 invasion of Iraq . [177] On May 26, 2004, a year after the war started, the newspaper asserted that some of its articles had not been as rigorous as they should have been, and were insufficiently qualified, frequently overly dependent upon information from Iraqi exiles desiring regime change. [178] Reporter Judith Miller retired after criticisms that her reporting of the lead-up to the Iraq War was factually inaccurate and overly favorable to the Bush administration's position, for which The New York Times later apologized. [179] [180] One of Miller's prime sources was Ahmed Chalabi , an Iraqi expatriate who returned to Iraq after the U.S. invasion and held a number of governmental positions culminating in acting oil minister and deputy prime minister from May 2005 until May 2006. [181] [182]

Iran
A 2015 study found that The New York Times fed into an overarching tendency towards national bias. During the Iranian nuclear crisis the newspaper minimized the "negative processes" of the United States while overemphasizing similar processes of Iran. This tendency was shared by other papers such as The Guardian , Tehran Times , and the Fars News Agency , while Xinhua News Agency was found to be more neutral while at the same time mimicking the foreign policy of the Peoples' Republic of China . [183]

Israeli–Palestinian conflict
A 2003 study in The Harvard International Journal of Press/Politics concluded that The New York Times reporting was more favorable to Israelis than to Palestinians. [184] A 2002 study published in the journal Journalism examined Middle East coverage of the Second Intifada over a one-month period in the Times , Washington Post and Chicago Tribune . The study authors said that the Times was "the most slanted in a pro-Israeli direction" with a bias "reflected ... in its use of headlines, photographs, graphics, sourcing practices and lead paragraphs." [185]
For its coverage of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict , some (such as Ed Koch ) have claimed that the paper is pro-Palestinian, while others (such as As`ad AbuKhalil ) have insisted that it is pro-Israel. [186] [187] The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy , by political science professors John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt , alleges that The New York Times sometimes criticizes Israeli policies but is not even-handed and is generally pro-Israel. [188] On the other hand, the Simon Wiesenthal Center has criticized The New York Times for printing cartoons regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that were claimed to be anti-Semitic . [189]
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected a proposal to write an article for the paper on grounds of lack of objectivity. A piece in which Thomas Friedman commented that praise awarded to Netanyahu during a speech at congress was "paid for by the Israel lobby" elicited an apology and clarification from its writer. [190]
The New York Times ' public editor Clark Hoyt concluded in his January 10, 2009, column, "Though the most vociferous supporters of Israel and the Palestinians do not agree, I think The New York Times , largely barred from the battlefield and reporting amid the chaos of war, has tried its best to do a fair, balanced and complete job — and has largely succeeded." [191]

World War II
On November 14, 2001, in The New York Times ' 150th anniversary issue, former executive editor Max Frankel wrote that before and during World War II, the NY Times had maintained a consistent policy to minimize reports on the Holocaust in their news pages. [192] Laurel Leff , associate professor of journalism at Northeastern University , concluded that the newspaper had downplayed the Third Reich targeting of Jews for genocide . Her 2005 book Buried by the Times documents the paper's tendency before, during and after World War II to place deep inside its daily editions the news stories about the ongoing persecution and extermination of Jews, while obscuring in those stories the special impact of the Nazis' crimes on Jews in particular. Leff attributes this dearth in part to the complex personal and political views of the newspaper's Jewish publisher, Arthur Hays Sulzberger , concerning Jewishness , antisemitism , and Zionism . [193]
During the war, The New York Times journalist William L. Laurence was "on the payroll of the War Department ". [194] [195]

Criticism and controversies

Failure to report famine in Ukraine
The New York Times was criticized for the work of reporter Walter Duranty , who served as its Moscow bureau chief from 1922 through 1936. Duranty wrote a series of stories in 1931 on the Soviet Union and won a Pulitzer Prize for his work at that time; however, he has been criticized for his denial of widespread famine, most particularly the Ukrainian famine in the 1930s. [196] [197] [198] [199] In 2003, after the Pulitzer Board began a renewed inquiry, the Times hired Mark von Hagen , professor of Russian history at Columbia University , to review Duranty's work. Von Hagen found Duranty's reports to be unbalanced and uncritical, and that they far too often gave voice to Stalinist propaganda . In comments to the press he stated, "For the sake of The New York Times' honor, they should take the prize away." [200]

Fashion news articles promoting advertisers
In the mid to late 1950s, "fashion writer[s]... were required to come up every month with articles whose total column-inches reflected the relative advertising strength of every ["department" or "specialty"] store ["assigned" to a writer]... The monitor of all this was... the advertising director [of the NYT ]... " However, within this requirement, story ideas may have been the reporters' and editors' own. [201]

Jayson Blair plagiarism
In May 2003, The New York Times reporter Jayson Blair was forced to resign from the newspaper after he was caught plagiarizing and fabricating elements of his stories. Some critics contended that African-American Blair's race was a major factor in his hiring and in The New York Times ' initial reluctance to fire him. [202]

Duke University lacrosse case
The newspaper was criticized for largely reporting the prosecutors' version of events in the 2006 Duke lacrosse case . [203] [204] Suzanne Smalley of Newsweek criticized the newspaper for its "credulous" [205] coverage of the charges of rape against Duke University lacrosse players. Stuart Taylor, Jr. and KC Johnson , in their book Until Proven Innocent: Political Correctness and the Shameful Injustices of the Duke Lacrosse Rape Case , write: "at the head of the guilt-presuming pack, The New York Times vied in a race to the journalistic bottom with trash-TV talk shows." [204]

M.I.A. quotes out of context
In February 2009, a Village Voice music blogger accused the newspaper of using "chintzy, ad-hominem allegations" in an article on British Tamil music artist M.I.A. concerning her activism against the Sinhala-Tamil conflict in Sri Lanka. [206] [207] M.I.A. criticized the paper in January 2010 after a travel piece rated post-conflict Sri Lanka the "#1 place to go in 2010". [208] [209] In June 2010, The New York Times Magazine published a correction on its cover article of M.I.A., acknowledging that the interview conducted by current W editor and then- Times Magazine contributor Lynn Hirschberg contained a recontextualization of two quotes. [210] [211] In response to the piece, M.I.A. broadcast Hirschberg's phone number and secret audio recordings from the interview via her Twitter and website. [212] [213]

Delayed publication of 2005 NSA warrantless surveillance story
The New York Times was criticized for the 13-month delay of the December 2005 story revealing the U.S. National Security Agency warrantless surveillance program . [214] Ex-NSA officials blew the whistle on the program to journalists James Risen and Eric Lichtblau , who presented an investigative article to the newspaper in November 2004, weeks before America's presidential election . Contact with former agency officials began the previous summer. [215]
Former The New York Times executive editor Bill Keller decided not to report the piece after being pressured by the Bush administration and being advised not to do so by New York Times Washington bureau chief Philip Taubman . Keller explained the silence's rationale in an interview with the newspaper in 2013, stating "Three years after 9/11, we, as a country, were still under the influence of that trauma, and we, as a newspaper, were not immune". [216]
In 2014, PBS Frontline interviewed Risen and Lichtblau, who said that the newspaper's plan was to not publish the story at all. "The editors were furious at me", Risen said to the program. "They thought I was being insubordinate." Risen wrote a book about the mass surveillance revelations after The New York Times declined the piece's publication, and only released it after Risen told them that he would publish the book. Another reporter told NPR that the newspaper "avoided disaster" by ultimately publishing the story. [217]

India's Mars Orbiter Mission cartoon controversy
In September 2014, around the time when India's Mars Orbiter Mission probe was to go into Mars orbit , the International New York Times published an editorial cartoon by Singapore cartoonist Heng Kim Song depicting a turban-wearing man with a cow knocking at the door of the "Elite Space Club" with members inside reading a newspaper with a headline about India's Mars mission. [218] [219]
The cartoon drew criticism, with critics saying that the cartoon was racist. [220] [221] [222] Times editorial page editor Andrew Rosenthal , apologized, writing in a Facebook post: "A large number of readers have complained about a recent editorial cartoon in The International New York Times, about India's foray into space exploration. The intent of the cartoonist ... was to highlight how space exploration is no longer the exclusive domain of rich, Western countries. Mr. Heng, who is based in Singapore, uses images and text – often in a provocative way – to make observations about international affairs. We apologize to readers who were offended by the choice of images in this cartoon. Mr. Heng was in no way trying to impugn India, its government or its citizens." [223] [219]

Irish student controversy
On June 16, 2015, The New York Times published an article reporting the deaths of six Irish students staying in Berkeley , California when the balcony they were standing on collapsed, the paper's story insinuating that they were to blame for the collapse. The paper stated that the behavior of Irish students coming to the US on J1 visas was an "embarrassment to Ireland". [224] The Irish Taoiseach and former President of Ireland criticized the newspaper for "being insensitive and inaccurate" in its handling of the story. [225]

Nail salon series
In May 2015, a New York Times exposé by Sarah Maslin Nir on the working conditions of manicurists in New York City and elsewhere [226] and the health hazards to which they are exposed [227] attracted wide attention, resulting in emergency workplace enforcement actions by New York governor Andrew M. Cuomo . [228] In July 2015, the story's claims of widespread illegally low wages were challenged by former New York Times reporter Richard Bernstein , in the New York Review of Books . Bernstein, whose wife owns two nail salons, asserted that such illegally low wages were inconsistent with his personal experience, and were not evidenced by ads in the Chinese-language papers cited by the story. [229] The New York Times editorial staff subsequently answered Bernstein's criticisms with examples of several published ads and stating that his response was industry advocacy. [230] The independent NYT Public Editor also reported that she had previously corresponded with Bernstein and looked into his complaints, and expressed her belief that the story's reporting was sound. [231]
In September and October 2015, nail salon owners and workers protested at The New York Times offices several times, in response to the story and the ensuing New York State crackdown. [232] [233] In October 2015, Reason magazine published a three part re-reporting of the story by Jim Epstein, charging that the series was filled with misquotes and factual errors respecting both its claims of illegally low wages and health hazards. Epstein additionally argued that The New York Times had mistranslated the ads cited in its answer to Bernstein, and that those ads actually validated Bernstein's argument. [234] [235] [236] In November 2015, The New York Times ' public editor concluded that the exposé's "findings, and the language used to express them, should have been dialed back — in some instances substantially" and recommended that "The Times write further follow-up stories, including some that re-examine its original findings and that take on the criticism from salon owners and others — not defensively but with an open mind." [237]

Hiring practices
In April 2016, two black female employees in their sixties filed a federal class action lawsuit against The New York Times Company CEO Mark Thompson and chief revenue officer Meredith Levien, claiming age , gender , and racial discrimination . The plaintiffs claim that the Times advertising department favored younger white employees over older black employees in making firing and promotion decisions. [238] [239] The Times said that the suit was "entirely without merit" and was "a series of recycled, scurrilous and unjustified attacks." [239]

Publishing leaked photos from the Manchester bombing
On May 24 2017, The New York Times caused outrage among the British police and government when it published leaked photos showing the scene of the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing . Counter terror police chiefs said the leak undermined their investigation and victims' and witnesses' confidence. The New York Times published photos it says were gathered by UK authorities at the scene of the attack, including the remnants of a backpack, nuts and screws, and a device identified as a "possible detonator". Greater Manchester Police were said to be "furious" and said they would stop sharing information with the US. President Donald Trump the next day in a NATO summit condemned the media leaks, calling it "deeply troubling" and a "grave threat to our national security". The New York Times defended its decision to publish the photos, saying they were "neither graphic nor disrespectful of victims". [240] [241]

Accusations of bias
New York Times public editor ( ombudsman ) Liz Spayd wrote in 2016 that "Conservatives and even many moderates, see in The Times a blue-state worldview" and accuse it of harboring a liberal bias. Spayd did not analyze the substance of the claim, but did opine that the Times is "part of a fracturing media environment that reflects a fractured country. That in turn leads liberals and conservatives toward separate news sources." [242] Times executive editor Dean Baquet stated that he does not believe coverage has a liberal bias, but that: "We have to be really careful that people feel like they can see themselves in The New York Times . I want us to be perceived as fair and honest to the world, not just a segment of it. It's a really difficult goal. Do we pull it off all the time? No." [242]
Times public editor Arthur Brisbane wrote in 2012: "When The Times covers a national presidential campaign, I have found that the lead editors and reporters are disciplined about enforcing fairness and balance, and usually succeed in doing so. Across the paper's many departments, though, so many share a kind of political and cultural progressivism — for lack of a better term — that this worldview virtually bleeds through the fabric of The Times ." [243]
In mid-2004, the newspaper's then public editor Daniel Okrent , wrote an opinion piece in which he said that The New York Times did have a liberal bias in news coverage of certain social issues such as abortion and same-sex marriage . He stated that this bias reflected the paper's cosmopolitanism , which arose naturally from its roots as a hometown paper of New York City. [171] He wrote, "if you're examining the paper's coverage of these subjects from a perspective that is neither urban nor Northeastern nor culturally seen-it-all; if you are among the groups The Times treats as strange objects to be examined on a laboratory slide (devout Catholics, gun owners, Orthodox Jews, Texans); if your value system wouldn't wear well on a composite New York Times journalist, then a walk through this paper can make you feel you're traveling in a strange and forbidding world." [171] Okrent wrote that the Time ' s Arts & Leisure, Sunday Times Magazine , and Culture coverage trend to the left. [244]
In December 2004, a University of California, Los Angeles study by former fellows of a conservative think tank gave The New York Times a score of 73.7 on a 100-point scale, with 0 being most conservative and 100 being most liberal, making it the second-most liberal major newspaper in the study after The Wall Street Journal (85.1). [245] The validity of the study has been questioned, however. The liberal watchdog group Media Matters for America pointed out potential conflicts of interest with the author's funding, and political scientists, such as Brendan Nyhan , cited flaws in the study's methodology. [246] [247]
Donald Trump has frequently criticized the New York Times on his Twitter account before and during his presidency; since November 2015, Trump has referred to the Times as "the failing New York Times " in a series of tweets. [248] Despite Trump's criticism, New York Times editor Mark Thompson noted that the paper had enjoyed soaring digital readership, with the fourth quarter of 2016 seeing the highest number of new digital subscribers to the newspaper since 2011. [249] [250] [251]
Critic Matt Taibbi accused The New York Times of favoring Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders in the paper's news coverage of the 2016 Democratic presidential primaries . [252] Responding to the complaints of many readers, New York Times public editor Margaret Sullivan wrote that, " The Times has not ignored Mr. Sanders's campaign, but it hasn't always taken it very seriously. The tone of some stories is regrettably dismissive, even mocking at times. Some of that is focused on the candidate's age, appearance and style, rather than what he has to say." [253] Times senior editor Carolyn Ryan defended both the volume of New York Times coverage (noting that Sanders had received about the same amount of article coverage as Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio ) and its tone. [254]

Reputation
The Times has developed a national and international "reputation for thoroughness" over time. [255] Among journalists, the paper is held in high regard; a 1999 survey of newspaper editors conducted by the Columbia Journalism Review found that the Times was the "best" American paper, ahead of the Washington Post , Wall Street Journal , and Los Angeles Times . [256] The Times also was ranked #1 in a 2011 "quality" ranking of U.S. newspapers by Daniel de Vise of the Washington Post ; the objective ranking took into account the number of recent Pulitzer Prizes won, circulation, and perceived Web site quality. [256] A 2012 report in WNYC called the Times "the most respected newspaper in the world." [257]
Nevertheless, like many other U.S. media sources, the Times had suffered from a decline in public perceptions of credibility in the U.S. from 2004 to 2012. [258] A Pew Research Center survey in 2012 asked respondents about their views on credibility of various news organizations. Among respondents who gave a rating, 49% said that the believed "all or most" of the Times ' s reporting, while 50% disagreed. A large percentage (19%) of respondents were unable to rate believability. The Times ' s score was comparable to that of USA Today . [258] Media analyst Brooke Gladstone of WNYC's On the Media writing for the New York Times says that the decline in U.S. public trust of the mass media can be explained (1) by the rise of the polarized Internet-driven news; (2) by a decline in trust in U.S. institutions more generally; and (3) by the fact that "Americans say they want accuracy and impartiality, but the polls suggest that, actually, most of us are seeking affirmation." [259]

Protests against SOPA and PIPA
On January 18, 2012, a series of coordinated protests occurred against two proposed laws in the United States Congress —the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the PROTECT IP Act (PIPA). These followed smaller protests in late 2011. Protests were based on concerns that the bills, intended to provide more robust responses to copyright infringement (colloquially known as piracy) arising outside the United States, contained measures that could possibly infringe online freedom of speech, websites, and Internet communities. Protesters also argued that there were insufficient safeguards in place to protect sites based upon user-generated content .
The move to a formal protest was initiated when some websites, including Reddit and the English Wikipedia , considered temporarily closing their content and redirecting users to a message opposing the proposed legislation. Others, such as Google , Mozilla , and Flickr , soon featured protests against the acts. Some shut down completely, while others kept some or all of their content accessible. According to protest organizer Fight for the Future , over 115,000 websites joined the Internet protest. [1] In addition to the online protests, there were simultaneous physical demonstrations in several U.S. cities, including New York City, San Francisco and Seattle, and separately during December 2011 a mass boycott of then–supporter Go Daddy . The protests were reported globally.
The January protest, initially planned to coincide with the first SOPA hearing of the year, drew publicity and reaction. Days prior to the action, the White House issued a statement that it would "not support legislation that reduces freedom of expression, increases cybersecurity risk, or undermines the dynamic, innovative global Internet." [2] On January 18 itself, more than 8 million people looked up their representative on Wikipedia, [3] 3 million people emailed Congress to express opposition to the bills, [1] more than 1 million messages were sent to Congress through the Electronic Frontier Foundation , [4] a petition at Google recorded over 4.5 million signatures, [3] Twitter recorded at least 2.4 million SOPA-related tweets, [3] and lawmakers collected "more than 14 million names—more than 10 million of them voters—who contacted them to protest" the bills. [5]
During and after the January protest, a number of politicians who had previously supported the bills expressed concerns with the proposals in their existing form, while others withdrew their support entirely. Internationally, "scathing" criticism of the bills was voiced from World Wide Web inventor Sir Tim Berners-Lee , [6] as well as the European Commissioner for the Digital Agenda . [7] Some observers were critical of the tactics used; the Boston Herald described the service withdrawals as evidence of "how very powerful these cyber-bullies can be." [8] Motion Picture Association of America Chairman Chris Dodd stated that the coordinated shutdown was "an abuse of power given the freedoms these companies enjoy in the marketplace today." [9] Others such as The New York Times saw the protests as "a political coming of age for the tech industry." [10]
By January 20, 2012, the political environment regarding both bills had shifted significantly. The bills were removed from further voting, ostensibly to be revised to take into consideration the issues raised, [5] but according to The New York Times probably "shelved" following a "flight away from the bill". [5] Opposers noted the bills had been "indefinitely postponed" but cautioned they were "not dead" and "would return." [11]

Background

Background to bills
The Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the PROTECT IP Act (PIPA) are bills that were introduced into the United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate in the last quarter of 2011. Both are responses to the problem of enforcement of U.S. laws against websites outside U.S. jurisdiction. While the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and other existing laws have generally been considered effective against illegal content or activities on U.S.-based sites, [12] action is more difficult against overseas websites. [12] SOPA and PIPA proposed to rectify this by cutting off infringing sites from their U.S. based funding (particularly advertising ), payment processors , appearances on search engines , and visibility on web browsers , instead. Major providers of all these services are predominantly U.S. based. Notably, the provisions also involved modifying the DNS system , a crucial service that underpins the entire Internet and allows computers to locate each other reliably around the world.
Supporters included, but were not limited to, media companies and industry associations such as the Motion Picture Association of America , the Recording Industry Association of America and the Entertainment Software Association . Supporters generally identified a need to have more effective laws to combat the illegal domestic sales of products and services, the counterfeiting and sale of products (such as prescription drugs, athletic shoes, and cosmetics), and worldwide copyright infringing activities which were problematic to prevent inasmuch as they originated outside the United States.
Those opposed included a mixture of technology and Internet firms and associations, content creators such as the Wikipedia community , free software authors, free speech organizations, lawmakers, and other websites and organizations, as well as members of the public using their services. They generally identified two main areas of severe side-effects: (1) effects on Internet websites, communities and user-generated content, and (2) effects on critically fundamental internet architecture and security:
Google 's policy director, Bob Boorstin, stated that a site like YouTube supporting user-generated content "would just go dark immediately" to comply with the legislation. [12] Tumblr , one of the first websites active in grassroots activism against the bills, added a feature that "censored" its website on November 16, 2011, and the social media aggregator Reddit also became deeply involved. [1]

Legislative and protest timeline
On November 16, 2011, a first hearing by the U.S. House Judiciary Committee was marked by online protests involving blackened website banners, popularly described as "American Censorship Day".
On December 15, 2011, the first House Judiciary Committee mark-up hearing took place for SOPA, prior to its eventual move to the House floor. [15] During the markup session, several proposed amendments to address technological and other concerns were defeated. The mark-up process was put on hold to be resumed after the new year.
Around this time, numerous websites began displaying banners and messages promoting their readerships to contact Congress to stop the progress of the bill, and some websites began to discuss or endorse a possible "Internet blackout" before any vote on SOPA in the House, as a means of further protest. [16] Reddit was the first major site to announce an "Internet blackout" for January 18, 2012, and several other sites shortly followed, coordinating actions for that day. [17]
A notable political response to the November 2011 protests was the outlining in early December of a bipartisan third, alternative, bill with the support of technology companies such as Google and Facebook , [18] which unusually had been posted on the Internet to allow public comment and suggestions in light of the widespread protests related to the SOPA and PIPA bills. It was formally introduced as the Online Protection and Enforcement of Digital Trade Act (OPEN) in the Senate on December 17 by Senator Ron Wyden and in the House on January 18 by Representative Darrell Issa . It proposed placing enforcement in the hands of the United States International Trade Commission , keeping provisions that targeted payments and advertising for infringing websites, and tightly targeted wording to avoid many other key areas of concern with SOPA and PIPA. [19]
Online discussions of a blackout and concerns over the bills continued unabated after the markup hearing and increased in prominence. On January 11, Senator Patrick Leahy , the main sponsor for PIPA, said of the DNS filtering provision, "I will therefore propose that the positive and negative effects of this provision be studied before implemented", [20] reported by some papers as removal of those provisions. [21] Opposers deemed this a tactical withdrawal allowing reintroduction at a later stage and ignoring other concerns as well as provisions in PIPA, and evidence that the bill had not been understood or checked by its own creators and that proposals for a blackout were gaining impact. [22] Momentum for the protests continued unchanged [21] since the bills had merely been postponed, and due to their other contentious provisions.

Protests of November 16, 2011 ("American Censorship Day")
On November 16, 2011, SOPA was discussed by the U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary . Tumblr , Mozilla, Techdirt, and the Center for Democracy and Technology were among many Internet companies who protested by participating in 'American Censorship Day', by displaying black banners over their site logos with the words "STOP CENSORSHIP." [23]

December 2011 boycott of Go Daddy
On December 22, 2011, users at Reddit proposed a boycott and a public day for switching away from then–SOPA supporter Go Daddy , [24] the largest ICANN -accredited registrar in the world, known as Move Your Domain Day . [25] The date was later set as December 29, 2011. [26]
Popular websites that moved domains included imgur , [27] the Wikimedia Foundation , [28] and Cheezburger — which stated it would remove over 1,000 domains from Go Daddy if they continued their support of SOPA. [29]
On December 23, Go Daddy withdrew its support for SOPA, releasing a statement saying "Go Daddy will support it when and if the Internet community supports it." [30] [31] CEO Warren Adelman stated when asked, that he couldn’t commit to changing Go Daddy's position on the record in Congress, but said "I’ll take that back to our legislative guys, but I agree that’s an important step"; [32] when pressed, he said "We’re going to step back and let others take leadership roles." [32] Further outrage was due to the fact that many Internet sites would be subject to shutdowns under SOPA, but GoDaddy is in a narrow class of exempted businesses that would have immunity, whereas many other domain operators would not. [33]
On December 26, 2011, a Google bomb was started against Go Daddy to remove them from the #1 place on Google for the term "Domain Registration" in retaliation for supporting SOPA. [34] This was then disseminated through Hacker News . [35] Reddit users noted that by December 22, 2011, SOPA supporters were discovering the backlash that could arise from ignoring social media users. [36]
Reports up to December 29 described Go Daddy as "hemorrhaging" customers. [37] [38] On December 25, 2011 (Christmas Day), Go Daddy lost a net 16,191 domains as a result of the boycott. [39] However, on December 29 itself, Go Daddy gained a net of 20,748 domains, twice as many as it lost that day, attributed by Techdirt to a number of causes, in particular customers having moved early, and an appeased customer response to their change of position over SOPA. [40] [41]

Protests of January 18, 2012

Protestors

Wikimedia community
On December 10, 2011, Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales drew attention to concerns over SOPA, which he described as a "much worse law" than the DDL intercettazioni (Wiretapping Bill) [42] in Italy some months earlier, which was being fast-tracked through the United States Congress under a "misleading title". He stated he was attending high-level meetings on this, and wanted to gauge the sense of the English Wikipedia community on the issue, and specifically on the question of a blackout similar to that held successfully in October 2011 by Italian Wikipedia editors over the proposed media censorship law in that country: [43]
Following initial informal discussions which resulted in a positive response, a formal consultation titled "SOPA Initiative" was opened by the community to consider specific proposals and preferred options. These included matters such as location (United States only or worldwide), and whether content should be disabled completely or still accessible after a click-through page. Eventually, the discussion led to a decision strongly in favor of a 24-hour global blackout of the site on January 18, disabling normal reading and editing functions, affirmed in a vote of approximately 1,800 editors. [44] The blocking action was purposely not complete; users could access Wikipedia content from the mobile interface or mirror sites, or if they disabled JavaScript or other web browser functions. [45] [46] [47] Within hours of the start of the blackout, many websites posted instructions for disabling the banner, by altering URLs, using browser add-ons such as Adblock Plus or Greasemonkey , or interrupting the page from loading completely.
The vote formally affected the English Wikipedia only; other language editions and Wikimedia projects were left free to decide whether to hold their own protests given the potential worldwide impact of the legislation, with technical support on offer from the Foundation. [44] The editor communities of at least 30 other sister projects chose to do so. [48]
On January 17, 2012, Jimmy Wales affirmed the results of the community's decision and that the Wikimedia Foundation , which hosts the English Wikipedia website, would support the community's decision. He called for a "public uprising" against the proposed legislation, which critics fear would threaten free speech. He added that factors such as funding or donations had not been part of the community's considerations, but the matter had arisen as "a principled stand" from the community, and that in his view "our best long-term prospect for Wikipedia in terms of our survival ... depends on us being principled". [49] He commented on editors' reasons for the decision: [49]
Wikimedia Executive Director Sue Gardner posted an announcement of the Foundation's support for the blackout proposal on Wikimedia's blog. The post received over 7000 responses from the general public within the first 24 hours of its posting. [50] The blackout was to run for 24 hours starting at 05:00 UTC ( midnight Eastern Standard Time ) on January 18. [51]
Despite the support of those polled for the action, a small number of Wikipedia editors blacked out their own user profile pages or resigned their administrative positions in protest of the blackout; one editor stated his "main concern is that it puts the organization in the role of advocacy, and that's a slippery slope". [52]

Other websites
According to protest organizer Fight for the Future , more than 115,000 websites participated in the protest, including Google and Wikipedia. [1] Websites that participated in the blackout included Cheezburger , Craigslist , Boing Boing , A Softer World , Cake Wrecks , Cyanide & Happiness , Demand Progress , Destructoid , DeckTech.net , Entertainment Consumers Association . Free Press , Failblog , Newgrounds , Good.is , GOG.com , Gamesradar , Internet Archive , Marxists Internet Archive , Jay is Games , Mojang , MoveOn.org , Mozilla , MS Paint Adventures , Rate Your Music , Reddit , Roblox , Oh No They Didn't , Tucows , blip.tv , Tumblr , TwitPic , Twitter , The Oatmeal , VGMusic , Wikia , WordPress , xkcd as well as the corporate site of the Linux distribution openSUSE and the congressional websites of Silicon Valley representatives Anna Eshoo and Zoe Lofgren . [53] [54] [55] Google announced their intention to join the blackout by altering their logo for US visitors for the day, almost entirely obscuring it with an interactive black redaction swath. Clicking through the specially designed logo took readers to an informational page about the bills, and the opportunity to sign a petition to be sent to Congress stating their concerns. [56]
The Mozilla Foundation altered the default start page of their Firefox web browser, blacking it out and providing links with more information on the SOPA/PIPA bills and the opposition to them, and to allow users to email their Congressional representatives. [57]
TV Tropes posted black bars atop the web page with the message "STOP SOPA".
Mojang 's bestselling game Minecraft made a splash text that said "SOPA means LOSER in Swedish !"
A site called The Spoony Experiment , known for a cute robot mascot called Burton, changed the homepage into a more nightmarish version, involving a nightmarish version of Burton and the words "The Spoony Experiment" replaced by red text proclaiming "The Experiment is Over", signifying the proposed death of several websites.
Wired magazine's online site used Javascript to place black bars on most of the text on their page, as if the text was redacted, outside of their key article regarding SOPA/PIPA; readers could remove the bars with a mouse click. [58] [59]
The photo-sharing website Flickr created the ability for a registered user to "censor" an unlimited number (up from an initial limit of ten) of photos as demonstration of how SOPA/PIPA regulation would affect the site; the user-selected photographs were greyed out, and included informational text. [60]
4chan ran a banner and "censored" posts by users on all image boards, [61] which could be viewed by hovering over them.
StumbleUpon added numerous links to anti-SOPA/PIPA websites.
A video was circulated by the League for Gamers (founded by Mark Kern and supported by ScrewAttack , Extra Credits , and LoadingReadyRun ) protesting the Entertainment Software Association 's support of SOPA by gathering support to boycott the ESA's popular E3 convention . [62]

Physical demonstrations
In addition to the online blackouts, protests in cities such as New York City, San Francisco, and Seattle were held on January 18 to raise awareness of the two bills. [63] [64]
A series of pickets against the bills were held at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. Two picketers were arrested. [65]

Reaction

Pre-protest
The announcement of the blackout was reported worldwide. Media that covered the story included ABC Australia , [66] CBC , [67] BBC , [68] der Spiegel , [69] Le Figaro , [70] Le Monde , [71] Libération , [72] Fox News , [73] The Guardian , [74] Menafn, [75] News Limited , [76] Sky News , [77] The Age , [78] The Hindu , [79] The New York Times , [80] [81] Taipei Times , [82] The Washington Post , [83] The Wall Street Journal [84] and The Times of India . [85]
Several media organizations including The Washington Post , The Guardian , and NPR encouraged a " crowdsourcing solution for those left searching for answers" during the Wikipedia blackout by inviting users to ask questions on Twitter using the hashtag #altwiki. [86]
An executive of the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) dubbed the blackout plan an example of the "gimmicks and distortion" that inflamed passions while failing to solve the problem of copyright infringement by "draw[ing] people away from trying to resolve what is a real problem, which is that foreigners continue to steal the hard work of Americans". [87] Former U.S. Senator and MPAA Director Chris Dodd stated that the coordinated shutdown was "also an abuse of power given the freedoms these companies enjoy in the marketplace today." [9]
Dick Costolo , CEO of social networking site Twitter , rejected calls for Twitter to join the protest, tweeting that "[c]losing a global business in reaction to single-issue national politics is foolish." [88] Originally, some thought Costolo referred to all of the blackout movements on January 18, but afterwards clarified that he was referring to a hypothetical blackout of Twitter, and that he was supportive of the Wikipedia blackout itself. [89]
The sponsor of the bill, Representative Lamar S. Smith , called the blackout a "publicity stunt," and stated with reference to Wikipedia that "it is ironic a website dedicated to providing information is spreading misinformation about the Stop Online Piracy Act." [90]
On January 17, 2012, in response to growing concerns over PIPA and SOPA, the White House stated that it "will not support legislation that reduces freedom of expression, increases cybersecurity risk, or undermines the dynamic, innovative global Internet." [2]

January 18
The Wikimedia Foundation reported that there were over 162 million visits to the blacked-out version of Wikipedia during the 24-hour period, with at least 8 million uses of the site's front page to look up contact information for their U.S. Congressional representatives. [3] [91] The usage of Wikipedia's front page increased enormously during the blackout with 17,535,733 page views recorded, compared with 4,873,388 on the previous day. [92] A petition created and linked to by Google recorded over 4.5 million signatures, [3] while the Electronic Frontier Foundation reported that more than 1 million email messages were sent to congressmen through their site during the blackout. [4] MSNBC reported that over 2.4 million Twitter messages about SOPA, PIPA, and the blackouts were made during a 16-hour period on January 18; this included Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg , who had not used the service since 2009, to encourage his followers to contact their congressmen. [93] [94] Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) , a key opponent of the bills, said that "lawmakers had collected more than 14 million names - more than 10 million of them voters" to protest the legislation. [5]
Time reported that before the day had ended, "the political dominoes began to fall ... then trickle turned into flood". [95] It named ten senators who had announced their switch to opposing the bills and stated that "nearly twice that many House members" had done so. [95]
During the blackout, libraries at several universities used the outage to remind students that the traditional paper encyclopedias were available for research. Students who grew up turning to the internet to look up information were encouraged to visit the library as an alternative source of information. [96] On Twitter, a joke hashtag #factswithoutWikipedia trended with users posting humorous fake "facts." [97] "Startled" Internet users frustrated or angry at their loss of Wikipedia for the day used Twitter as an outlet; politicians likewise turned to Twitter when overwhelmed by the public communications flood in support of the blackout. [95] CTV news in Canada published a "survival guide" for "getting around the blackout" on their national website, citing Wikipedia as the answer to "burning questions such as "Are chinchillas rodents?" and "What does ‘rickrolling' mean?" The guide provided detailed instructions on how to circumvent the ban and access the English Wikipedia during the protest. [98] CTV referred to the protest as " a date that will live in ignorance ." [99] Creative America , a coalition representing movie studios, entertainment unions, and television networks, used the blackout to prompt those affected by it to enjoy other forms of entertainment in place of their normal Internet activities; such ads appeared at Times Square in New York City and on various websites. [64]

Post-protest
The impact of the coordinated action was generally considered to be significant. Yochai Benkler of the Berkman Center for Internet & Society stated that the January 18 blackout was "a very strong public demonstration to suggest that what historically was seen as a technical system of rules that only influences the content industry has become something more," further adding "You've got millions of citizens who care enough to act. That's not trivial." [100] California House member Darrell Issa called the collective effort an unprecedented means for upsetting a backroom lobbying effort, [101] and the immediate political efficacy of the widespread online protest was characterised in terms of a sleeping giant having awakened and of a new player being in town. [102] One Silicon Valley lobbyist said the content industry had "a lot to learn," noting that they don't have grassroots support: "There are no Facebook pages to call your congressman to support PIPA and SOPA." [103] The New York Times , which framed the netizens' revolt in terms of the new economy versus the old economy, [104] headlined the activism as a "political coming of age for the tech industry." [10] (James Grimmelmann, an Associate Professor at New York Law School , opined two months later that "Legal systems are like Soylent Green : they're made out of people. If you want to protect civil liberties using law, you need to get people on your side who share your vision of what law stands for. That's why the SOPA protests were so effective. They converted an argument about justice into real-world political power.") [105]
Newspaper editorials had mixed views. The Boston Herald called the protest a "hissy fit" by "Internet powerhouses" saying, "within hours of the online protest, political supporters of the bill... began dropping like flies, thus proving how very powerful these cyber-bullies can be." [8] The New York Times described the protest as "Noted, but as a Brief Inconvenience" [106] and, as well, offered an opinion about the protest and possible accomplishments. [107] BBC News technology writer Rory Cellan-Jones was of the opinion that the blackout achieved its objectives but possibly at some cost to Wikipedia's reputation. [108] Bill Keller was of the view that "Jimmy Wales... assumed a higher profile as a combatant for the tech industry [and] supplied an aura of credibility to a libertarian alliance that ranged from the money-farming Megatrons of Google to the hacker anarchists of Anonymous." [109]
Media columnist David Carr wrote in the New York Times that there were two lessons, one being that "People who don’t understand the Web should not try to re-engineer it", and the other that while businesses generally prize their relations with their customers, in the struggle between media and technology companies, the latter have "a much more chronic [i.e. ongoing], intimate relationship with consumers" and would more likely prevail. [110]
Motion Picture Association of America chairman Chris Dodd admitted that the content industry had lost the public relations battle with the Internet industry, adding that "[y]ou've got an opponent who has the capacity to reach millions of people with a click of a mouse and there's no fact-checker. They can say whatever they want." [111] Dodd called for Hollywood and Silicon Valley to work out a compromise on the legislation, [112] but was also criticized for a statement on Fox News to the effect that politicians would risk having campaign funding cut off if they did not support media industry proposals. [113] [114] The legal director of public interest group Public Knowledge was quoted on that organization's website as writing: [115]
Among other media industry reactions, Creative America was of the view that "[t]hey've misidentified this issue as an issue about your Internet, your Internet is being jeopardized. In fact their business model is being asked to be subjected to regulation. They're misleading their huge base." [116] Recording Industry Association of America President Cary Sherman noted that the major television networks supported the legislation but, unlike Wikipedia and Google, did not use their platforms to try to shape public opinion: "when Wikipedia and Google purport to be neutral sources of information that is not only not neutral but affirmatively incomplete and misleading, they are duping their users into accepting as truth what are merely self-serving political declarations." [117]
Rep. Lamar Smith, who sponsored SOPA, flatly stated in a commentary on Fox News that "This bill does not threaten the Internet. But it does threaten the profits generated by foreign criminals who target the U.S. market and willfully steal intellectual property by trafficking in counterfeit or pirated goods." [118] While speaking on the Senate floor on January 23 Senator Leahy reiterated his objections to the protests, saying:

International responses
World Wide Web inventor Sir Tim Berners-Lee "scathingly" [6] attacked the SOPA and PIPA legislation. Speaking at an industry event in Florida he praised the protests by major sites for the attention they had drawn, and described the bills as a "grave threat to the openness of the Internet" that "had to be stopped": [6]
Two days later, Vice-President of the European Commission and European Commissioner for the Digital Agenda Neelie Kroes described the bills as "bad legislation" that would "threaten the basic foundation of the success of the web". [7] She also said there "should be safeguarding benefits of open net." "Speeding is illegal too but you don't put speed bumps on the motorway," she said. [120]

Related protests
SOPA and PIPA protests were overlapped and followed by protests against ACTA which has a similar sense. The ACTA treaty was signed by 22 Member States in Europe and was expected to be signed before March 2012 by the other left Cyprus, Estonia, Netherlands and Slovakia, and thus would have gained legal force for the whole European Union. On February 11, more than 200 European cities took part in a widespread protest against ACTA. [121] [122] Although protests were held in Europe, the signing of ACTA was led by USA, Australia, Canada, South Korea, Japan, New Zealand, Morocco, and Singapore, which were first to sign the treaty at a ceremony on October 1, 2011, in Tokyo. [123] However, the concerns of ACTA are much related and raised after the protests against SOPA and PIPA which directed the public attention to bills and acts that may threaten Internet and civic liberties.

Legislative impact and aftermath
During the day of January 18, six of PIPA's sponsors in the Senate, including Marco Rubio , PIPA's co-sponsor, Orrin Hatch , Kelly Ayotte , Roy Blunt , John Boozman , and Mark Kirk , stated that they would withdraw their support for the bills. [124] Several other congressmen issued statements critical of the current versions of both bills. [125] [126]
By the following day, eighteen of the 100 senators, including eleven of the original sponsors of the PIPA bill, had announced that they no longer supported PIPA. [127] By one account, the shift in stated positions on SOPA/PIPA by members of Congress had gone overnight from 80 for and 31 against to 65 for and 101 against. [128] An initial floor vote was scheduled for January 24, prior to the Internet blackout, but following these responses, Senator Majority Leader Harry Reid announced that the vote will be postponed, urging the bill's main sponsor, Senator Patrick Leahy , to work out compromise in the bill "to forge a balance between protecting Americans' intellectual property, and maintaining openness and innovation on the Internet." [5] [129] Similarly, the House Judiciary Subcommittee chairman, Representative Lamar S. Smith , announced that further voting on SOPA would be placed on hold "until there is wider agreement on a solution." [130] [131] Later, an updated The New York Times news story reported that the two bills were "indefinitely shelved." [5] House Committee on Oversight Chairman Darrell Issa commented that "This unprecedented effort has turned the tide against a backroom lobbying effort by interests that aren't used to being told 'no'", describing the events as a "responsible and transparent exercise of freedom of speech". [132] Opposers cautioned that although "postponed," the bills were "not dead" and "would return." [11]
Months after the protests, in July 2012, The New York Times summarized events as follows: [133]
The development of the electronic grassroots campaign has been the subject of academic analysis. [134] [135]

Other proposed laws
According to the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), "SOPA and PIPA are really only the tip of the iceberg. The same forces behind these domestic U.S. laws have continued to both push for other states to pass similar domestic laws, as well as to secretly negotiate international trade agreements that would force signatory nations to conform to the same legal standards." [136]
Examples cited by EFF include: [136]
Examples considered "similar to SOPA/PIPA" by other analyses:

German Wikipedia
The German Wikipedia ( German : deutschsprachige Wikipedia ) is the German-language edition of Wikipedia , a free and publicly editable online encyclopedia .
Founded in March 2001, it is the second-oldest and, with 2,065,211 articles, at present (2017) the fourth-largest edition of Wikipedia by number of articles, behind the English Wikipedia , the Swedish Wikipedia and the Cebuano Wikipedia . [1] [2] It has the second-largest number of edits. On 7 November 2011, it became the second edition of Wikipedia, after the English edition, to exceed 100 million page edits.

Early history
The German edition of Wikipedia was the first non-English Wikipedia subdomain, and was originally named deutsche.wikipedia.com . Its creation was announced by Jimmy Wales on 16 March 2001. [2] One of the earliest snapshots of the home page, dated 21 March 2001 (revision #9), can be seen at the Wayback Machine site. [3] Aside from the home page, creation of articles in the German Wikipedia started as early as April 2001, apparently with translations of Nupedia articles. [4] The earliest article still available on Wikipedia's site is apparently Polymerase-Kettenreaktion , dated May 2001. [5]
Andrew Lih wrote that the hacker culture in Germany and the verein concept solidified the German Wikipedia's culture. The geography of Europe facilitated face-to-face meetups among German Wikipedians. [6]

Growth, coverage and popularity
On 27 December 2009, the German Wikipedia edition exceeded 1,000,000 articles, [7] becoming the first edition after the English-language Wikipedia to do so. The millionth article was Ernie Wasson . In November 2008, 90% of the edition's articles had more than 512 bytes , 49% had more than 2 kilobytes , and the average article size was 3,476 bytes. [8] In the middle of 2009 this edition had nearly 250,000 biographies and in December 2006 more than 48,500 disambiguations. [9]
Compared to the English Wikipedia, the German edition tends to be more selective in its coverage, often rejecting small stubs, articles about individual fictional characters and similar materials. Instead, there is usually one article about all the characters from a specific fictional setting, usually only when the setting is considered important enough (for example, all characters from Star Wars are listed in a single article). A dedicated article about a single fictional entity generally exists only if the character in question has a very significant impact on popular culture (for example, Hercule Poirot ). [ citation needed ] Andrew Lih wrote that German Wikipedia users believe that "having no article at all is better than a very bad article." [10] Therefore, growth on the German Wikipedia leveled before it did for the English Wikipedia , with accelerating growth in article count shifting to constant growth in mid-2006. The number of users signing up for accounts began to steadily decline in 2007 through 2008. [10]
The January 2005, Google Zeitgeist announced that "Wikipedia" was the eighth most-searched query on Google.de. In February 2005, Wikipedia reached third place behind Firefox and Valentine's Day . In June 2005, Wikipedia ranked first.

Language and varieties of German
Separate Wikipedias have been created for several other varieties of German, including Alemannic German ( als: ), Luxembourgish ( lb: ), Pennsylvania German ( pdc: ), Ripuarian (including Kölsch ; ksh: ), Low German ( nds: ) and Bavarian ( bar: ). These however, have less popularity than the German Wikipedia. [12]

Characteristics
The German Wikipedia is different from the English Wikipedia in a number of aspects.

Reviewed versions
At Wikimania 2006 , Jimbo Wales announced that the German Wikipedia would soon institute a system of " stable article versions " on a trial basis. The system went live in May 2008. Certain users [ who? ] are now able to mark article versions as "reviewed", indicating that the text contains no obvious vandalism. A note in the top right corner of the screen indicates to the reader whether or not the present version of an article has already been reviewed, and provides access to the most recent reviewed version or a more current, unreviewed version as needed.

Miscellanea

Events
The first real-life meetup of Wikipedians took place in October 2003 in Munich . As a result of this meeting regularly striking round tables (called “Wikipedia-Stammtisch”) established themselves at various places in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. The round tables have become an important aspect of collegial exchange within the German-speaking community. [24]
Each spring and autumn, the German Wikipedia organizes a writing contest, where a community-elected jury rates nominated articles. Prizes are sponsored by individual community members and companies. The first contest was held in October 2004 - the article Kloster Lehnin (Lehnin Abbey) was selected as the winner from 44 nominated articles. The second contest, held in March 2005, saw 52 contributions, and the third, in September 2005, 70. A trial to extend the contest to an international level met with limited success, with only the Dutch, English and Japanese Wikipedias participating. [25]
For the March 2006 writing contest, the 150 nominated articles were split into three sections: history and society (56 nominations), arts and humanities (36), and science (46). The article on the Brown Bear ( German : Braunbär ) won, and of the nominated 27 articles reached featured status a few weeks after the contest. [26] In March 2007, the sixth contest was held, with the winner being the article on the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict ( German : Haager Konvention zum Schutz von Kulturgut bei bewaffneten Konflikten ).
German Wikipedians organized the first international Wikipedia conference, Wikimania 2005 , in August 2005 in Frankfurt . Some 300 people from over 50 countries attended the three-day conference.
From 17 March to 15 April 2006, the Göttingen State and University Library held a special exhibition documenting the first five years of Wikipedia. [27]
In 2006, the University of Göttingen hosted the first Wikipedia Academy . The Academy was intended to familiarize the academic world with Wikimedia projects. In 2007, the second such meeting took place, organized in conjunction with the Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur (Academy of Science and Literature) in Mainz as part of the German Jahr der Geisteswissenschaften (Year of the Humanities ), which was decreed by the German Federal Ministry for Education and Research . A third meeting was organized on 20–21 June 2008 in Berlin , during the Jahr der Mathematik (Year of Mathematics); the meeting was hosted by the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities . [28]
German Wikipedians have since organised the Foto-Workshop meeting of photographers , with participants from 10 countries.

Contacts with Brockhaus
In April 2004, a complete list of article titles from the leading German encyclopedia Brockhaus was uploaded to the German Wikipedia, in an apparent attempt to facilitate the creation of still missing articles. A representative of Brockhaus asked for and obtained the deletion of what was believed to be a copyright infringement. As a result of the developing email conversation, a group of five Wikipedians visited the "new media" group of Brockhaus in Mannheim on 1 July 2004. [29] The friendly meeting saw a lively discussion of the differing approaches to writing an encyclopedia; it became clear that Brockhaus had closely observed Wikipedia for quite some time.

Article-free Sunday
On 23 November 2006, the number of articles at German Wikipedia reached 500,000. As a response to this and to the perception that quality control was not keeping up with article creation, it was proposed to declare 10 December 2006 " Article-free Sunday ", a day where participants voluntarily agree to post no new articles, but instead focus on improving existing ones. It was also proposed to declare 10 December " Counter-action to Article-free Sunday ", a day where participants create missing articles and improve existing ones.

Subsidies from the German government
In June 2007, a project on renewable resources ( WikiProjekt Nachwachsende Rohstoffe ) was initiated, [30] [31] the goal being to write and improve articles on the topic. The project was run for three years and was subsidized by the German Ministry of Agriculture with approximately €80,000 a year. It was organised and managed by the private company "nova-Institut GmbH". Nova GmbH and Wikimedia Deutschland e. V. fund the project with approximately €60,000 a year in addition, so the budget is approximately €420,000 in total. [ citation needed ]
These funds were mainly used to organise the project and also to search for experts in the field who have not contributed to Wikipedia yet. Nova may also have paid expense allowances to authors. [32]

Most-disputed articles
According to a 2013 Oxford University study, the article on Croatia was the most disputed article on the German Wikipedia. The top ten most disputed articles then also included Adolf Hitler , Scientology , and Rudolf Steiner . [33] One of the largest disputes among a simple sentence was however about the Donauturm in Vienna. [34] While the observation tower shares some architectural aspects with the Fernsehturm Stuttgart , it was never planned for TV broadcasting purposes. The German Wikipedia had a rather lengthy (about 600,000 characters) discussion about the suitable title and categories, as (often Austrian authors) denied the description of Donauturm as a "TV tower". [34] The Spiegel coverage of the issue cited a participant with "On good days, Wikipedia is better than any TV soap". [34]

Reviews and research
In September 2004, the respected computer magazine c't compared the German Wikipedia with the Brockhaus Multimedia encyclopedia and the German edition of Microsoft 's Encarta . On a scale from 0 to 5, Wikipedia "won" with a total score of 3.4. [35] A few weeks later, the weekly newspaper Die Zeit also compared content from Wikipedia with other reference works and found that Wikipedia only has to "share its lead position in the field of natural science." [ this quote needs a citation ] The DVD version of Spring 2005 received a rather negative review by Björn Hoffmann — product manager working for the Bibliographisches Institut & F.A. Brockhaus in July 2005. [ citation needed ]
In November 2005 the OpenUsability project in cooperation with the Berlin-based Relevantive AG conducted a usability test of the German Wikipedia. [36] The study focused on finding information and included a set of recommendations to change the MediaWiki interface. In February 2006, the open usability project led a second test which focused on the experience of new editors. [37] The reports were published in English.
A second test by c't in February 2007 used 150 search terms, of which 56 were closely evaluated, to compare four digital encyclopedias: Bertelsmann Enzyklopädie 2007, Brockhaus Multimedial premium 2007, Encarta 2007 Enzyklopädie and Wikipedia. With respect to concerns about the reliability of Wikipedia , it concluded: "We did not find more errors in the texts of the free encyclopedia than in those of its commercial competitors". [38]
In December 2007, German magazine Stern published the results of a comparison between the German Wikipedia and the online version of the 15-volume edition of Brockhaus Enzyklopädie . The test was commissioned to a research institute (Cologne-based WIND GmbH), whose analysts assessed 50 articles from each encyclopedia (covering politics, business, sports, science, culture, entertainment, geography, medicine, history and religion) on four criteria (accuracy, completeness, timeliness and clarity), and judged Wikipedia articles to be more accurate on the average (1.6 on a scale from 1 to 6, versus 2.3 for Brockhaus with lower = better). Wikipedia's coverage was also found to be more complete and up to date, however Brockhaus was judged to be more clearly written, while several Wikipedia articles were criticized as being too complicated for non-experts, and many as too lengthy. [39] [40] [41]

Off-line publication

CD November 2004
In November 2004, Directmedia Publishing GmbH started distributing a CD-ROM containing a German Wikipedia snapshot. Some 40,000 CDs were sent to registered customers of directmedia. The price was 3 euros per CD.
The display and search software used for the project, Digibib , had been developed by Directmedia Publishing for earlier publications; it ran on Windows and Mac OS X (and now also on Linux ). The Wikipedia articles had to be converted to the XML format used by Digibib .
To produce the CD, a dump of the live Wikipedia had been copied to a separate server, where a team of 70 Wikipedians vetted the material, deleting nonsense articles and obvious copyright violations. Questionable articles were added to a special list, to be reviewed later. The final CD contained 132,000 articles and 1,200 images.
The ISO image was distributed for free via eMule and BitTorrent . In December, the CHIP computer magazine placed the Wikipedia data on the DVD that it distributes with every issue. The Wikipedia materials are published under GFDL while the Digibib software may only be copied for non-commercial use, except the Linux version which is GPLed .

CD/DVD April 2005
A new release of Wikipedia content was published by Directmedia on 6 April 2005. This package consisted of a 2.7 GB DVD and a separate bootable CDROM (running a version of Linux with Firefox). The CDROM did not contain all the data, but was included to accommodate users without DVD-drives. The DVD used Directmedia's Digibib software and article format; everything could be installed to a hard drive. In addition, the DVD contained an HTML tree, as well as Wikipedia articles formatted for use with PDAs (specifically, the Mobipocket and TomeRaider formats).
The production of the DVD motivated the Personendaten project (see above).
The vetting process was similar to the one for the CD described above and took place on a separate MediaWiki server. The process took about a week and involved 33 Wikipedians, communicating on IRC . To prevent duplication of work, editors would protect every article that they had reviewed; links to protected articles were shown in green. Lists of potential spammed or vandalized articles had been produced ahead of time with SQL queries. Unacceptable articles were simply deleted on the spot. While the XML articles for the earlier CD version had been produced from HTML, this time a script was used to convert Wiki markup directly to the Digibib format. The final DVD contained about 205,000 articles, with every article linking to a list of contributors.
Directmedia sold 30,000 DVDs, at €9.90 each. This price included 16% taxes and a one-euro donation to Wikimedia Deutschland ; production costs were about €2. The DVD image can also be downloaded for free.
Following the successful launch of the DVD, Directmedia donated high-resolution pictures of 10,000 public domain paintings to Wikimedia Commons (see related Signpost story ).

DVD/book December 2005
The next edition of Wikipedia content was issued in December 2005 by the publisher Zenodot Verlagsgesellschaft mbH, a sister company of Directmedia. A 139-page book explaining Wikipedia, its history and policies was accompanied by a 7.5 GB DVD containing 300,000 articles and 100,000 images. The book with DVD is sold for €9.90; both are also available for free download. [42]
The vetting process for this version was different and did not involve human intervention. A " white list " of trusted Wikipedians was assembled, the last 10 days of every article's history were examined, and the last version edited by a white-listed Wikipedian was chosen for the DVD. If no such version existed, the last version older than 10 days was used. Articles nominated for cleanup or deletion were not used.

DVD December 2006/2007 and 2007/2008
The December 2006/2007 and 2007/2008 edition can be downloaded from dvd.wikimedia.org.

Books

Wikipress series
The December 2005 book about Wikipedia was the first in a series titled Wikipress . These books, published by Zenodot, consisted of a collection of Wikipedia articles about a common topic, selected and edited by so-called "Wikipeditors" who may receive compensation from Directmedia. The books were assembled on a separate server from those used for the regular German Wikipedia pages. Every Wikipress book was accompanied by an "edit card", a post card that readers could send in to edit the book's contents. Wikipress books about the Nobel Peace Prize , bicycles , Antarctica , the solar system , and Hip hop , amongst others, were released, and other books on topics as diverse as Whales , Conspiracy theories , Manga , Astrophysics , and the Red Cross were in the works. [43] Due to lack of interest, the project was ended after a few books. [ citation needed ]

100 volume Wikipedia
The publisher Zenodot announced in January 2006 that they intend to publish the complete German Wikipedia in print, 100 volumes with 800 pages each, starting with the letter A in October 2006, followed by two volumes each month thereafter, to end with Z in 2010. The project, code named WP 1.0, was to be supported by 25 editors employed by Zenodot as well as a scientific advisory board. Changes made to articles before publication would also be available for incorporation into the online Wikipedia.
In March 2006, Zenodot organized a "community day" to meet with Wikipedians and discuss the project. Groups of Wikipedians had already begun to polish articles with titles Aa-Af in selected topics. In late March it was announced that the project was put on hold and no books would be published in 2006; the reason given was that community support was lacking. [44]

Bertelsmann
On 22 April 2008, the publisher Bertelsmann announced that it planned to publish a one-volume encyclopedia in September using content from the German-language Wikipedia. The volume was planned to include abbreviated entries for the 50,000 most commonly used search terms of the prior two years. The book is priced at 19.95 euros, with one euro from every sale going to the German chapter of the Wikimedia Foundation . [45] It was released on 15 September 2008 in hardcover, containing 992 pages and many illustrations.

Legal issues and controversies

Deletions
The German Wikipedia has been criticized for the deletion of articles because they seem "irrelevant" to those who deleted them, even though they seem expedient, meaningful, well written and extensive enough to other people. These discussions received press coverage in computer magazines as well as in mainstream media. [46] [47] [48] [49] [50]

Unauthorized uses
While everyone is free to use Wikipedia content, there are certain conditions, such as attribution, a copy of the license text and no non-free derivative works (see Creative Commons licenses and GNU Free Documentation License for details).
In March 2005, the German news magazine Der Spiegel published an article on the Rwandan Genocide in its online edition; it was a copy of Wikipedia's article. The article was taken down soon after and replaced with an apology. [51]
In April 2005, the encyclopedia Brockhaus published an article about the new pope Josef Ratzinger in its online edition. Because of its close similarity to Wikipedia's article, suspicion arose right away that the Brockhaus article might have been plagiarism. The article was removed soon after but Brockhaus did not apologize or admit guilt (see the Wikipedia Signpost 's coverage .)

Large-scale copyright infringement (2003–2005)
In mid-November 2005, it was discovered that an anonymous user had entered hundreds of articles from older encyclopedias that had been published in the 1970s and 1980s in East Germany . The articles were mainly on topics in philosophy and related areas. The user had started in December 2003.
A press release was issued and numerous editors started to remove the copyright protected materials. This was made difficult by the fact that the old encyclopedias were not online and not easily available from many West German libraries, and that the user had used numerous different IP addresses. The Directmedia DVD had to be updated. [52]

Bertrand Meyer article hoax
On 28 December 2005, the article computer scientist Bertrand Meyer (creator of the Eiffel programming language ) was edited by an anonymous user, falsely reporting that Meyer had died four days earlier. The hoax was reported five days later by the Heise News Ticker and the article was immediately corrected. Major news media in Germany and Switzerland picked up on the story, creating the German Wikipedia's version of the Seigenthaler incident . Meyer himself went on to publish a positive evaluation of Wikipedia, concluding, "The system succumbed to one of its potential flaws, and quickly healed itself. This doesn't affect the big picture. Just like those about me, rumors about Wikipedia's downfall have been grossly exaggerated." [53]

Naming Tron
In 2006, Wikimedia Deutschland, the German chapter of the US Wikimedia Foundation , was drawn into a legal dispute between the parents of the deceased German computer hacker Boris "Tron" Floricic and the Foundation. [54] The parents did not wish Floricic's real name to be publicly mentioned, and in December 2005 they obtained a preliminary injunction in a Berlin court against the American Wikimedia Foundation , requiring removal of Floricic's name from Wikipedia. The name was not removed. On 19 January 2006 they obtained a second injunction, this time against Wikimedia Deutschland, prohibiting the address www.wikipedia.de (which is under control of Wikimedia Deutschland) to redirect to the German Wikipedia at de.wikipedia.org (which is controlled by the Wikimedia Foundation and hosts the actual encyclopedia) as long as Wikipedia mentioned Floricic's name. Wikimedia Deutschland complied and replaced the redirect with a note explaining the situation, but without mentioning the Tron case specifically. The German Wikipedia remained accessible through de.wikipedia.org during this time. One day later, Wikimedia Deutschland achieved a suspension of the injunction, and linked from the note at www.wikipedia.de to the German Wikipedia. On 9 February, the court invalidated the injunction, ruling that neither the rights of the deceased nor the rights of the parents were affected by publishing the name; this ruling was upheld on appeal, decided 12 May.

Lutz Heilmann controversy
In November, 2008, Lutz Heilmann , a member of the German parliament , obtained a preliminary injunction against Wikimedia Deutschland e. V., forbidding the forwarding of www.wikipedia.de to de.wikipedia.org . According to Focus Online , Heilmann objected to claims that he had not completed his university degree, and that he had participated in a business venture involving pornography . The report also suggests that the Wikipedia article had been repeatedly altered in line with his claims by an anonymous user operating within the Bundestag building , but Heilmann denied having been involved in an edit war. Wikimedia Germany displayed a page explaining the situation. Heilmann announced on 16 November that he would drop the legal proceedings against Wikimedia Deutschland, regretting that many uninvolved users of the encyclopedia had been affected.

Superprotect and Media Viewer controversy
In 2014, the Wikimedia Foundation (WMF) "superprotected" a JavaScript file on German Wikipedia so that no German editors, not even administrators, were allowed to edit it. Many German editors left over this dispute. [55] [56] An open letter to the WMF was signed by almost 1,000 Wikimedians . [57] In April 2015 Erik Möller left the WMF; the "superprotect" feature was disabled in November. [58]

Reiss Engelhorn Museum
In 2015 the Reiss Engelhorn Museum sued the WMF and its German chapter Wikimedia Deutschland for alleged copyright violations of 17 public domain pictures. [59] [60]

Parodies and forks
Parodies of the German Wikipedia include Kamelopedia , created in April 2004, Stupidedia , created in December 2004, and the German version of Uncyclopedia , created in August 2005. [61]
Ulrich Fuchs, a longtime contributor to the German Wikipedia, produced a fork known as Wikiweise in April 2005. It is ad-supported, uses its own software (but a similar wiki markup), admits only registered editors, and prominently displays the real names of every article's major contributors. It has since gone offline.

Notes

Wikipedia Seigenthaler biography incident
In May 2005, an anonymous editor posted a hoax article in the online encyclopedia Wikipedia about journalist John Seigenthaler . [1] The article falsely stated that Seigenthaler had been a suspect in the assassinations of U.S. President John F. Kennedy and U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy . The then-78-year-old Seigenthaler, a friend and aide to Robert Kennedy, characterized the Wikipedia article about him as "Internet character assassination". [2]
The hoax was not discovered and corrected until September of that year, after which Seigenthaler wrote about his experience in USA Today . The incident raised questions about the reliability of Wikipedia and other websites with user-generated content that lack the legal accountability of traditional newspapers and published materials. [3] In a December 13 interview, [4] co-founder Jimmy Wales expressed his undiminished support for Wikipedia policy allowing articles to be edited by anonymous users – describing the participation of editors in China and Iran in terms of privacy issues – but announced plans to roll back their article creation privileges as part of a vandalism-control strategy: "...we've decided that we want to slow down...so starting in January we're preventing unregistered users from creating new pages, because so often those have to be deleted...". [4]

Hoax
The author of the hoax article was later identified as Brian Chase, an operations manager of Rush Delivery, a delivery service company in Nashville, Tennessee . [5] On May 26, 2005, Chase added a new article that contained, in its entirety, the following text:

Detection and correction
In September, Victor S. Johnson, Jr. , a friend of Seigenthaler's, discovered the article. [6] After Johnson alerted him to the article, Seigenthaler e-mailed his friends and colleagues about it. On September 23, 2005, colleague Eric Newton copied Seigenthaler's official biography from the Freedom Forum web site into Wikipedia. The following day, this biography was removed by a Wikipedia editor due to copyright violation , and was replaced with a short original biography. [7] Newton informed Seigenthaler of his action when he ran into Seigenthaler in November in New York at the Committee to Protect Journalists dinner.
In October 2005, Seigenthaler contacted the Chair of the Board of Trustees of the Wikimedia Foundation, Jimmy Wales , who hid affected versions of the article history from public view in the Wikipedia version logs, in effect removing them from all but Wikipedia administrators ' view. [8] In 2013, the hoax article was undeleted and archived to Wikipedia:List of hoaxes on Wikipedia . Some mirror websites not controlled by Wikipedia continued to display the older and inaccurate article for several weeks until the new version of the article was propagated to these other websites. [9]

Anonymous editor identified
Seigenthaler wrote an op-ed article describing the particulars of the incident, which appeared in USA Today , of which he had been the founding editorial director. [2] The article was published on November 29, 2005. In the article, he included a verbatim reposting of the false statements and called Wikipedia a "flawed and irresponsible research tool." An expanded version was published several days later in The Tennessean , a daily newspaper in Nashville, Tennessee, where Seigenthaler had served in various capacities from beat reporter to chairman. In the article, Seigenthaler detailed his own failed attempts to identify the anonymous person who posted the inaccurate biography. He reported that he had asked the poster's Internet service provider , BellSouth , to identify its user from the user's IP address . BellSouth refused to identify the user without a court order, suggesting that Seigenthaler file a John Doe lawsuit against the user, which Seigenthaler declined to do.
Daniel Brandt, a San Antonio activist who had started the anti-Wikipedia site "Wikipedia Watch" in response to objections he had to his eponymous article, looked up the IP address in Seigenthaler's article, and found that it related to "Rush Delivery", a company in Nashville. He contacted Seigenthaler and the media, and posted this information on his website. [10]
On December 9, Brian Chase admitted he had posted the false biography to Wikipedia because he believed Wikipedia to be "some sort of joke Web site." [11] After confessing, Chase was fired from his job at Rush Delivery. Seigenthaler received a hand-written apology [ clarification needed ] and spoke with Chase on the phone. Seigenthaler confirmed – as he had previously stated – that he would not file a lawsuit in relation to the incident, and urged Rush Delivery to rehire Chase, which it did. Seigenthaler commented: "I'm glad this aspect of it is over." He stated that he was concerned that "every biography on Wikipedia is going to be hit by this stuff – think what they'd do to Tom DeLay and Hillary Clinton , to mention two. My fear is that we're going to get government regulation of the Internet as a result." [12]

Reactions

Seigenthaler's public reaction
In his November 29, 2005, USA Today editorial, Seigenthaler criticized Congress for Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act , which protects ISPs and web sites from being held legally responsible for content posted by their customers and users: [2]
On December 5, 2005, Seigenthaler and Wales appeared jointly on CNN to discuss the matter. On December 6, 2005, the two were interviewed on National Public Radio 's Talk of the Nation radio program. Wales described a new policy that he had implemented in order to prevent unregistered users from creating new articles on the English-language Wikipedia, though their ability to edit existing articles was retained.
In the CNN interview, Seigenthaler also raised the spectre of increased government regulation of the Web:
In the December 6 joint NPR interview, Seigenthaler said that he did not want to have anything to do with Wikipedia because he disapproved of its basic assumptions. In an article Seigenthaler wrote for USA Today in late 2005, he said, "I am interested in letting many people know that Wikipedia is a flawed and irresponsible research tool." [2] He also pointed out that the false information had been online for over four months before he was aware of it, and that he had not been able to edit the article to correct it. After speaking with Wikipedia co-founder, Jimmy Wales, Seigenthaler said: "My 'biography' was posted May 26. On May 29, one of Wales' volunteers 'edited' it only by correcting the misspelling of the word 'early.' For four months, Wikipedia depicted me as a suspected assassin before I erased it from the website's history Oct. 5. The falsehoods remained on Answers.com and Reference.com for three more weeks." [2] Editing Wikipedia, he suggested, would lend it his sanction or approval, and he stated his belief that editing the article was not enough and instead he wanted to expose "incurable flaws" in the Wikipedia process and ethos.
On December 9, Seigenthaler appeared on C-SPAN 's Washington Journal with Brian Lamb hosting. He said he was concerned that other pranksters would try to spoof members of Congress or other powerful figures in government, which may then prompt a backlash and turn back First Amendment rights on the Web.
In the June 2007 issue of Reason magazine, Seigenthaler also expressed concern about the lack of transparency underlined by Wales' removal of the hoax pages from the article's history page. He has also stated that many of the comments left by users in the edit summaries are things he would not want his nine-year-old grandson to see. [13]

Wikimedia Foundation reaction
In an interview with BusinessWeek on December 13, 2005, Wales discussed the reasons the hoax had gone undetected and steps being taken to address them. [4] He stated that one problem was that Wikipedia's use had grown faster than its self-monitoring system could comfortably handle, and that therefore new page creation would be deliberately restricted to account-holders only, addressing one of Seigenthaler's main criticisms.
He also gave his opinion that encyclopedias as a whole (whether print or online) were not usually appropriate for primary sources and should not be relied upon as authoritative (as some were doing), but that nonetheless Wikipedia was more reliable as "background reading" on subjects than most online sources. He stated that Wikipedia was a "work in progress". [4]
A variety of changes were also made to Wikipedia's software and working practices, to address some of the issues arising. A new policy, ' biographies of living persons ', was created on December 17, 2005; editorial restrictions, including reference requirements, were introduced on the creation of new Wikipedia articles; and new tracking categories for the biographies of living people were implemented. [14]
The Foundation added a new level of "oversight" features to the MediaWiki software, [15] accessible as of May 16, 2012 to around 37 experienced editors and Wikimedia staff members nominated by either Wales or the Arbitration Committee . This originally allowed for specific historical versions to be hidden from everyone (including Oversight editors), which then become unable to be viewed by anyone except developers via manual intervention, though the feature was later changed so that other Oversighters could view these revisions to monitor the tool's use. Currently such procedures are standardized by the 'Office actions' policy which states: "Sometimes the Wikimedia Foundation has to delete, protect or blank a page without going through the normal site/community process(es). These edits are temporary measures to prevent legal trouble or personal harm and should not be undone by any user." [16]

Other reactions
In reaction to the controversy, The New York Times business editor Larry Ingrassia sent out a memo to his entire staff commenting on the reliability of Wikipedia and writing, "We shouldn't be using it to check any information that goes into the newspaper." [17] Several other publications commented on the incident, often criticizing Wikipedia and its open editing model as unreliable, citing the Seigenthaler incident as evidence.
The scientific journal Nature conducted a study comparing the accuracy of Wikipedia and the Encyclopædia Britannica in 42 hard sciences related articles in December 2005. The Wikipedia articles studied were found to contain four serious errors and 162 factual errors, omissions or misleading statements, while the Encyclopædia Britannica also contained four serious errors and 123 factual errors, omissions or misleading statements. [18] Referring to the Seigenthaler incident and several other controversies, the authors wrote that the study "suggests that such high-profile examples are the exception rather than the rule."

Vanderbilt University
Vanderbilt University (also known informally as Vandy ) [6] [7] is a private research university founded in 1873 and located in Nashville, Tennessee . It was named in honor of shipping and rail magnate Cornelius Vanderbilt , who provided the school its initial $1 million endowment despite having never been to the South . Vanderbilt hoped that his gift and the greater work of the university would help to heal the sectional wounds inflicted by the Civil War . [8]
Today, Vanderbilt enrolls approximately 12,000 students from all 50 U.S. states and over 100 foreign countries in four undergraduate and six graduate and professional schools . Several research centers and institutes are affiliated with the university, including the Vanderbilt Institute for Public Policy Studies, Freedom Forum First Amendment Center , Dyer Observatory , and Vanderbilt University Medical Center , the only Level I trauma center in Middle Tennessee. With the exception of the off-campus observatory and satellite medical clinics, all of the university's facilities are situated on its 330-acre (1.3 km 2 ) campus in the heart of Nashville, 1.5 miles (2.4 km) from downtown. Despite its urban surroundings, the campus itself is a national arboretum and features over 300 different species of trees and shrubs.
Vanderbilt is ranked as one of the top universities for its undergraduate teaching, research opportunities, and post-graduate employment placements. [9] It is ranked 15th on the list of best national universities generated by U.S. News & World Report . [10]

History

Founding and early years
In the years prior to the American Civil War of 1861–1865, the Methodist Episcopal Church South had been considering the creation of a regional university for the training of ministers in a location central to its congregations. [11] Following lobbying by Nashville bishop Holland Nimmons McTyeire , the author of an essay about black slavery whose father was "a cotton planter and a slaveholder" in South Carolina , [12] church leaders voted to found "The Central University of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South" in Nashville in 1872. [11] [13] However, lack of funds and the ravaged state of the Reconstruction Era South delayed the opening of the college. [11]
The following year, McTyeire stayed at the New York City residence of Cornelius Vanderbilt , whose second wife was Frank Armstrong Crawford Vanderbilt (1839–1885), a cousin of McTyeire's wife, Amelia Townsend McTyeire (1827–1891); both women were from Mobile, Alabama . [14] [15] [16] Indeed, the McTyeires had met at St. Francis Street Methodist Church in Mobile. [14] Cornelius Vanderbilt, who was the wealthiest man in the United States at the time, was considering philanthropy as he was at an advanced age. He had been planning to establish a university on Staten Island , New York , in honor of his mother. [11] However, McTyeire convinced him to donate $500,000 to endow Central University in order to "contribute to strengthening the ties which should exist between all sections of our common country." [11] [17]
The endowment was eventually increased to $1 million (roughly $19,973,867 in 2015 dollars [18] ) and would be only one of two philanthropic causes financially supported by Vanderbilt. Though he never expressed any desire that the university be named after himself, [11] McTyeire and his fellow trustees rechristened the school in his honor. Vanderbilt died in 1877 without seeing the school named after him. [11] [19] They acquired land formerly owned by Texas Senator John Boyd (who chose to patronize the establishment of Trinity University , a Presbyterian university in San Antonio, Texas instead), later inherited by his granddaughter and her husband, Confederate Congressman Henry S. Foote , who had built Old Central, a house still standing on campus. [20]
One of the founding trustees, Hezekiah William Foote , was a Confederate veteran and the owner of four plantations in Mississippi , including Mount Holly . [21] The Treasurer of the Board of Trust from 1872 to 1875, Alexander Little Page Green , whose portrait hangs in Kirkland Hall, [22] was a Methodist preacher and a former slave owner. [23] [24] His son-in-law, Robert A. Young , was a Methodist minister who served as the Financial Secretary on the Board of Trust from 1874 to 1882, retiring from the board in 1902. [25]
The first building, Main Building, later known as Kirkland Hall, was designed by William Crawford Smith , a Confederate veteran who also designed The Parthenon ; its construction began in 1874. [25] [26] In the fall of 1875, about 200 students enrolled at Vanderbilt, and in October the university was dedicated. [11] Bishop McTyeire was named Chairman of the Board of Trust for life by Vanderbilt as a stipulation of his endowment. [11] McTyeire named Landon Garland (1810–1895), his mentor from Randolph-Macon College in Virginia and then- Chancellor of the University of Mississippi , as chancellor. Garland shaped the school's structure and hired the school's faculty, many of whom were renowned scholars in their respective fields. [17] However, most of this faculty left after disputes with Bishop McTyeire, including over pay rates. [11] When the first fraternity chapter, Phi Delta Theta , was established on campus in 1876, it was shut down by the faculty, only to be reestablished as a secret society in 1877. [27] Meanwhile, Old Gym , designed by Dutch-born architect Peter J. Williamson , was built in 1879–1880. [26] By 1883, the Board of Trust passed a resolution allowing fraternities on campus, and more chapters were established in 1884. [27]

Split with the Methodist Church
During the first 40 years, the Board of Trust, and therefore the university, was under the control of the General Conference (the governing body) of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South . [11] Tension grew between the university administration and the Conference over the future of the school, particularly over the methods by which members of the Vanderbilt Board of Trust would be chosen, and the extent that non-Methodists could teach at the school. [11]
Conflicts escalated after James H. Kirkland was appointed chancellor in 1893. [11] Then the Southern Methodist Church congregations raised just $50,000 in a campaign to raise $300,000. [11]
After the Tennessee Centennial Exposition of 1897, a statue of Cornelius Vanderbilt, designed by Italian sculptor Giuseppe Moretti , [28] was moved from the grounds of the Parthenon to the Vanderbilt campus. [29]
In 1905, Kirkland Hall burnt down, only to be rebuilt shortly after. [26] Meanwhile, the Board of Trust voted to limit Methodist representation on the board to just five bishops. [11] Former faculty member and bishop Elijah Hoss led a group attempting to assert Methodist control. [11] In 1910, the board refused to seat three Methodist bishops. [11] The Methodist Church took the issue to court and won at the local level. On March 21, 1914, the Tennessee Supreme Court ruled that the Commodore, and not the Methodist Church, was the university's founder and that the board could therefore seat whomever it wished. [11] The General Conference in 1914 voted 151 to 140 to sever its ties with Vanderbilt; it also voted to establish a new university, Southern Methodist University , and to greatly expand Emory University .

1920s through World War II
In the 1920s and 1930s, Vanderbilt University hosted two partly overlapping groups of scholars who had a large impact on American thought and letters: the Fugitives and the Agrarians . [11] Meanwhile, Frank C. Rand , who served as the President and later Chairman of the International Shoe Company , donated US$150,000 to the university in 1925; [31] Rand Hall was subsequently named for him.
In 1933, the United Daughters of the Confederacy donated $50,000 (roughly $925,166 in 2015 dollars [18] ) for the construction of Confederate Memorial Hall , designed by architect Henry C. Hibbs . [32] It was completed in 1935. [32]
In the 1930s, Ernest William Goodpasture and his colleagues in the School of Medicine invented methods for cultivating viruses and rickettsiae in fertilized chicken eggs. [33] This work made possible the production of vaccines against chicken pox , smallpox , yellow fever , typhus , Rocky mountain spotted fever and other diseases caused by agents that only propagate in living cells. [33] Alfred Blalock , Professor of Surgery, and his assistant Vivian Thomas identified a decrease in blood volume and fluid loss outside the vascular bed as a key factor in traumatic shock and pioneered the use of replacement fluids for its treatment. [34] This treatment saved countless lives in World War II , [34] during which Vanderbilt was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a Navy commission. [35]
Shortly after the war, from 1945 to 1947, researchers at Vanderbilt University conducted an experiment funded by the Rockefeller Foundation where they gave 800 pregnant women radioactive iron , [36] [37] 751 of which were pills, [38] without their consent. [37] In a 1969 article published in the American Journal of Epidemiology , it was estimated that three children had died from the experiment. [38] When the United States Department of Energy tried to investigate what had happened in 1993, they were told by the university that the records had been destroyed in the 1970s. [38] Democratic Senator Jim Sasser called the experiment "deeply disturbing." [38] After the women sued, they received US$9.1 million from Vanderbilt University and US$900,000 from the Rockefeller Foundation in 1998. [37]

1950s and 1960s
In 1953, the School of Religion admitted the first African-American student to the university. [39] In 1960, the School of Religion expelled a student who was one of the leaders of the emerging civil rights movement, James Lawson . Several faculty members resigned in protest. [40] In 2005, Lawson was re-hired as a Distinguished University Professor for the 2006–2007 academic year, and named a Distinguished Alumnus for his achievements. [40]
The Vanderbilt Board of Trust in May 1962 voted to accept African Americans in all schools, and first undergraduates entered the school the fall of 1964. [39] The university drew national attention in 1966 when it recruited Perry Wallace , the first African-American athlete in the Southeastern Conference (SEC). [41] Wallace, from Nashville, played varsity basketball for Vanderbilt from 1967 to 1970, and faced considerable opposition from segregationists when playing at other SEC venues. [42] In 2004, a student-led drive to retire Wallace's jersey finally succeeded. [42]

1970s to present
In 1979, Vanderbilt acquired Peabody College , then called the "George Peabody College for Teachers", residing on 53 acres adjacent to the university. [43] In the early 1980s, Vanderbilt University was a financial backer of the Corrections Corporation of America prior to its IPO. [44] [45]
In 2002, the university decided to rename Confederate Memorial Hall, a residence hall on the Peabody campus to Memorial Hall. [46] Nationwide attention resulted, in part due to a lawsuit by the Tennessee chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy. [47] The Davidson County Chancery Court dismissed the lawsuit in 2003, but the Tennessee Court of Appeals ruled in May 2005 that the university must pay damages based on the present value of the United Daughters of the Confederacy's contribution if the inscription bearing the name "Confederate Memorial Hall" was removed from the building or altered. [48] The Court of Appeals' decision has been critiqued by legal scholars. [49] In late July 2005, the university announced that although it had officially renamed the building, and all university publications and offices will refer to it solely as Memorial Hall , the university would neither appeal the matter further, nor remove the inscription and pay damages. [50] In August 2016, the university agreed to remove the word "Confederate" from the building after "anonymous donors" donated $1.2 million to repay the United Daughters of the Confederacy. [51]
In 2009, Vanderbilt instituted a no-loan policy. The policy states that any student granted admission and a need-based aid package will have an award that includes no student loans. [52] In 2011, the Oakland Institute , an Oakland, California -based think tank, exposed Vanderbilt University's $26 million investment in EMVest Asset Management , a private equity firm "accused of ' land grabbing ,' or taking over agricultural land used by local communities through exploitative practices and using it for large-scale commercial export farming … in five sub-Saharan African countries, including Mozambique, South Africa, Swaziland, Zambia, and Zimbabwe." [53] The revelation made international headlines, with coverage in The Guardian , and led to student protests on campus in 2012. [53] [54] By 2013, Vanderbilt administrators had caved in to the public outcry and divested from EMVest. [53]
In 2015, Vanderbilt opened a new innovation center, the Wond'ry, as part of its Academic Strategic Plan. [55] The three-story, 13,000-square foot building is meant to serve as an interdisciplinary hub of knowledge for the Vanderbilt community, serving as the location of hackathons, partnerships with the Nashville Entrepreneurship Center, and several social venture programs. [56] Robert Grajewski, former president of Edison Nation Medical, a health care innovation incubator, and co-founder of Heritage Handcrafted and PRO-Techs Antimicrobial, will be the center's inaugural executive director. The four key programs at the center are the Innovation Garage, Social Entrepreneurship, Innovation Culture, and Entrepreneur Pre-Flight. [57]

Organization and administration
Vanderbilt University, as a private corporation, is wholly governed by an independent, self-perpetuating Board of Trust. The board comprises 45 regular members (plus any number of trustees emeriti) and the chancellor, the university's chief executive officer . [58] Each trustee serves a five-year term (except for four recently graduated alumni, who serve two two-year terms). Mark Dalton is the board's chairman . [59]
Nicholas S. Zeppos currently serves as chancellor of Vanderbilt University. He was appointed interim chancellor after the departure of Gordon Gee , who left to reassume the presidency of Ohio State University on August 1, 2007, [60] and was named chancellor in his own right on March 1, 2008. [61]

Administration history
Since the opening of the university in 1875, only eight individuals have served as chancellors. [62] Landon Garland was the university's first chancellor, serving from 1875 to 1893. [62] Garland organized the university and hired its first faculty. Garland Hall, an academic building on campus, is named in his honor. [62]
The next chancellor was James Kirkland —serving from 1893 to 1937, he had the longest tenure of any Vanderbilt chancellor. [62] He was responsible for severing the university's ties with the Methodist Church and relocating the medical school to the main campus. [62] Vanderbilt's Main Building was renamed Kirkland Hall after Kirkland left in 1937. [62]
The longest-tenured chancellor was followed by one of the shortest-tenured. [62] Oliver Carmichael served Vanderbilt for just nine years, 1937 to 1946. [62] Carmichael developed the graduate school, and established the Joint University Libraries for Vanderbilt, Peabody, and Scarritt College. [62] Carmichael Towers, a set of high-rise dormitories on the northern edge of campus, were named for Chancellor Carmichael. [62]
Carmichael's successor was Harvie Branscomb . [62] Branscomb presided over a period of major growth and improvement at the university that lasted from 1946 until 1963. [62] He was responsible for opening the admissions policy to all races. [62] Branscomb Quadrangle is a residence hall complex named for the chancellor. [62]
Alexander Heard , for whom the campus's 10-library system (with 3.3 million total volumes) is named, served as chancellor from 1963 to 1982. [62] During his 20-year tenure, the Owen Graduate School of Management was founded, and Vanderbilt's merger with Peabody College was negotiated. [62] He also survived calls for his ouster because of his accommodating stance on desegregation. [62]
Joe B. Wyatt was the chancellor who served immediately after Heard, from 1982 until 2000. [62] Wyatt oversaw a great increase in the university's endowment, an increase in student diversity, and the renovation of many campus buildings. [62] Wyatt placed great emphasis on improving the quality of faculty and instruction, and during his tenure Vanderbilt rose to the top 25 in the U.S. News & World Report' s annual rankings for the first time. [63] The Wyatt Center on Peabody's campus is named for Wyatt and his wife.
Gee was appointed chancellor by the Board of Trust in February 2000. [62] The Board of Trust has since established a committee to monitor more closely the spending by the chancellor's office. [64]
After Gordon Gee's departure in 2007, Zeppos was named interim chancellor. [65] He was named chancellor suo jure on March 1, 2008, by the university's Board of Trust. [66]

Medical Center
The Vanderbilt University Medical Center is a component of the university, and is the only Level I Trauma Center in Middle Tennessee. [8] VUMC comprises the following units: Vanderbilt University Hospital, Monroe Carell, Jr., Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt, Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Vanderbilt Psychiatric Hospital, Vanderbilt Clinic, Vanderbilt Bill Wilkerson Center, Vanderbilt Stallworth Rehabilitation Hospital, Eskind Biomedical Library, Vanderbilt Sports Medicine, Dayani Human Performance Center, Vanderbilt Page Campbell Heart Institute, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine , and Vanderbilt University School of Nursing . [67]
With over 23,000 employees, Vanderbilt is the largest private employer in Middle Tennessee and the second largest in the state. [68] [69] Approximately 74% of the university's faculty and staff are employed by the Medical Center. [8] In 2008, the medical center was placed on the Honor Roll of U.S. News & World Report' s annual rating of the nation's best hospitals, ranking 15th overall in the country. [70]

Students and faculty

Profile
As of 2015, Vanderbilt had an enrollment of 6,851 undergraduate and 5,874 graduate and professional students, for a total of 12,725 students. [71] Students from all 50 states and more than 90 countries attend Vanderbilt, with 66% of the total student body coming from outside the Southeast. [4] Moreover, 53.5% of the class of 2018 classified as Caucasian, 9.3% Hispanic/Latino, 9.5% Black or African American, 12.6% Asian, and 8.0% other/two or more races; 7.0% of the class is international. [72] As of 2014, the incoming class was 50% male and 50% female. [4]
Vanderbilt lets undergraduates choose between 70 majors , or create their own, in its four undergraduate schools and colleges: the College of Arts and Science , the School of Engineering , Peabody College of Education and Human Development , and Blair School of Music . [8] The university also has six graduate and professional schools, including the Divinity School, Graduate School , Law School , School of Medicine , School of Nursing , and Owen Graduate School of Management . [8]
The university's undergraduate programs are highly selective: in 2017, the Office of Undergraduate Admissions accepted 8.6% of its 27,841 Regular Decision applicants, thus making Vanderbilt one of the most selective universities in the United States and the most selective university in the state of Tennessee. [73] [74] In its most recent annual comparison of admissions selectivity, The Princeton Review gave Vanderbilt a rating of 99 out of 99. [75] The admitted first-year class of 2021 had standardized test scores that were well above average: the interquartile range (25th percentile – 75th percentile) of SAT scores was 740-800 for Critical Reading, 770-800 for Math, and 680-770 for Writing, while the interquartile range of ACT scores was 33–35. [76] For students of the class of 2016 whose schools reported exact class rankings, 96.21% ranked in the top 10% of their class, with an average rank of 3.39%. [77]

Research
Vanderbilt investigators work in a broad range of disciplines, and the university consistently ranks among the top 20 research institutions in the United States. [78] [79] In 2013, Vanderbilt University was ranked 9th in the country in funding from the National Institutes of Health. [80] Its Institute for Space and Defense Electronics , housed in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, includes the largest academic facility in the world involved in radiation-effects research. [81]
Among its more unusual activities, the university has institutes devoted to the study of coffee and of bridge . [82] Indeed, the modern form of the latter was developed by Harold Stirling Vanderbilt , a former president of the university's Board of Trust and a great-grandson of the Commodore. [82] In addition, in mid-2004 it was announced that Vanderbilt's chemical biology research may have serendipitously opened the door to the breeding of a blue rose , something that has long been coveted by horticulturalists and rose lovers. [83]
Vanderbilt's research record is blemished, however, by a study university researchers, in conjunction with the Tennessee Department of Health, conducted on iron metabolism during pregnancy in the 1940s. [84] Between 1945 and 1949, over 800 pregnant women were given radioactive iron. Standards of informed consent for research subjects were not rigorously enforced at that time, [B] and many of the women were not informed of the potential risks. The injections were later suspected to have caused cancer in at least three of the children who were born to these mothers. [85] In 1998, the university settled a class action lawsuit with the mothers and surviving children for $10.3 million. [86]
Vanderbilt is a member of the SEC Academic Consortium. Now renamed the SECU, the initiative was a collaborative endeavor designed to promote research, scholarship, and achievement among the member universities in the Southeastern Conference. The SECU's goals include highlighting the endeavors and achievements of SEC faculty, students, and universities and advancing the academic reputation of SEC universities. [87] [88]
In 2013, Vanderbilt University participated in the SEC Symposium in Atlanta, Georgia , which was organized and led by the University of Georgia and its Bioenergy Systems Research Institute. The topic of the symposium was titled "The Impact of the Southeast in the World's Renewable Energy Future". [89]

Rankings
In its 2016 edition, U.S. News & World Report ranked Vanderbilt 15th among all national universities. [98] In the same publication's graduate program rankings, the Peabody College of Education was ranked third in the nation among schools of education, [99] and the Vanderbilt Law School was listed at 16th, the School of Medicine was listed at 15th among research-oriented medical schools , the School of Nursing was listed at 15th, the School of Engineering was listed at 34th, and the Owen Graduate School of Management was listed at 25th among business schools. [100] Additionally, U.S. News & World Report ranked Vanderbilt first in the nation in the fields of special education , educational administration, and audiology . [100] In 2014, the Owen Graduate School of Management was ranked 30th by BloombergBusinessweek among full-time MBA programs. [101]
The Academic Ranking of World Universities ranks Vanderbilt as the 60th-best university in the world. Additionally the ARWU Field rankings in 2015 placed Vanderbilt as 18th best in the world for Clinical Medicine and Pharmacy, and 21st in Social Sciences. [102] In the Times Higher Education 2016 World University Rankings, Vanderbilt is 87th. The 2016/17 QS World University Rankings ranked Vanderbilt university 203rd in the world. Human Resources & Labor Review , a national human competitiveness index & analysis, ranked the university as one of 50 Best World Universities in 2011. [103] The 2007 Faculty Scholarly Productivity Index , a measure of the scholarly output of the faculty of nearly 7,300 doctoral programs around the United States, ranked Vanderbilt 8th among large research universities, and 1st in the areas of comparative literature , educational leadership , pharmacology , Portuguese , Spanish , and special education. [104] Poets & Writers ranked Vanderbilt's English Department's MFA Program in Creative Writing 18th among the top 50 writing programs in the United States in 2010 and 14th in the United States in 2011. [105] Fortune magazine ranked Vanderbilt among the top 100 places to work in the United States, the only university on their list. [106]

Campus layout
The Vanderbilt campus is located approximately 1.5 miles (2.4 km) southwest of downtown in the West End neighborhood of midtown Nashville. It has an area of 330 acres (1.3 km 2 ), though this figure includes large tracts of sparsely used land in the southwest part of the main campus, as well as the Medical Center. [107] The historical core of campus encompasses approximately 75 acres (0.3 km 2 ). [108]
The oldest part of the Vanderbilt campus is known for its abundance of trees and green space, which stand in contrast to the surrounding cityscape of urban Nashville. [109] The campus was designated as a national arboretum in 1988 by the Association of Botanical Gardens and Arboreta, and approximately 190 species of trees and shrubs can be found on campus. [109] One tree, the Bicentennial Oak between Rand Hall and Garland Hall, is certified to have lived during the American Revolution and is the oldest living thing on the campus. [109] In December 2015, a hackberry tree fell, leaving 10 students injured with "broken bones and stitches." [110] [111]

Main campus
In the northeast corner of the campus (the base of the fan) is the original campus. [112] This section stretches from West End Avenue south to the Stevenson Center and west from 21st Avenue to Alumni Lawn. The majority of the buildings of the arts and humanities departments of the College of Arts and Science, as well as the facilities of the Law School, Owen Graduate School of Management, and the Divinity School, are located in the original campus. Additionally, the Heard Central Library and Sarratt Student Center/Rand Hall can be found on the original campus. [112]
Flanking the original campus to the south are the Stevenson Center for Science and Mathematics—built on a woodland once known as the Sacred Grove [113] —and the School of Engineering complex (Jacobs Hall-Featheringill Hall). Housing the Science Library, the School of Engineering, and all the science and math departments of the College of Arts and Science, this complex sits between the original campus and the Medical Center. [112] The Vanderbilt University Medical Center itself takes up the southeastern part of the campus. [112] Besides the various associated hospitals and clinics and the facilities of the Schools of Medicine and Nursing, the medical center also houses many major research facilities.
West of the original campus and the Medical Center, Greek Row and the bulk of the Vanderbilt residence halls are found. [112] From north to south, Carmichael Towers, Greek Row, Branscomb Quadrangle, and Highland Quadrangle house the vast majority of on-campus residents in facilities ranging from the double-occupancy, shared-bathroom dorms in Branscomb and Towers to the apartments and lodges in Highland Quadrangle. [112]
Memorial Gymnasium , Vanderbilt Stadium , Hawkins Field , McGugin Center, and all the other varsity athletic fields and facilities are to be found in the extreme west of campus. [112] The Student Recreation Center and its associated intramural fields are located south of the varsity facilities. [112]

Peabody campus
Directly across 21st Avenue from the Medical Center sits the campus of the Peabody College of Education and Human Development. [112]

Student life

Organizations
The university recognizes nearly 530 student organizations, [ citation needed ] ranging from academic major societies and honoraries to recreational sports clubs, the oldest of which is the Vanderbilt Sailing Club. [114]
One publication, The Vanderbilt Hustler , was established in 1888 and is the oldest continuously published newspaper in Nashville. [115] In Langford v. Vanderbilt University (1956), a student sued the university for libel; [116] the Tennessee court dismissed the lawsuit, concluding the university was not the owner of the newspaper. [117] Additional student publications include those published by the College of Arts & Science, such as the Vanderbilt Political Review and the Vanderbilt Historical Review , as well as the Vanderbilt University Law School, which publishes three law reviews ; the flagship journal is the Vanderbilt Law Review . The on-campus radio station, WRVU , represents the student body by playing a range of music from bluegrass to choral, with a focus on non-mainstream music. [118]
Vanderbilt also has a large performing arts community spanning every genre of the arts with multiple organizations representing each category. There are dance groups covering contemporary, tap, hip hop, Latin, and Bhangra styles as well as numerous theatre, improvisation, spoken word, music and singing groups including the 2014 Sing-Off champion male a cappella group, The Melodores. [119] Performing arts organizations comprise over 1,000 students and are represented by the Vanderbilt Performing Arts Community, which supports groups by sponsoring performances and awards. [120]
The university is home to 17 fraternities and 16 sororities as of Spring 2015. [121] As of 2006–2007, 35% of men were members of fraternities and 49% of women were members of sororities, or 42% of the total undergraduate population. [122]
In 2012, students took part in the Occupy movement on campus. They pitched tents outside Kirkland Hall.
The student body is governed by Vanderbilt Student Government, which includes Senate, Judicial, and Executive Branches. This organization is responsible for the distribution of nearly $2 million in funds set aside by the university to fund student organizations.

Honor code
Vanderbilt students are required to sign an Honor Code, agreeing to conform to a certain set of behaviors. [123] There is an Honor Council, comprising a student executive board and representatives from each class year, that enforces and protects the Honor Code and to informs members of the Vanderbilt community about the Honor System. [124] Violations can lead to discipline or expulsion from the university. [125] In 2009, a student sued the university over his expulsion. [125]
Dean of Students Charles Madison Sarratt explained the honor code:

Student housing
Generally, undergraduate students are required to live in dorms on campus, with first-year students all living in the ten resident halls on Peabody Campus and all upperclassmen living on the main campus. [127] Exceptions are made for students living with relatives in Davidson County , students with health exemptions, married students, and some students with senior standing. [127] Two of the new residence halls have received LEED silver certification and the new Commons Dining Center has received gold certification, making Vanderbilt the only university in the state to be recognized by the U.S. Green Building Council . [128] [129] The university expects all five of the new residence halls and one renovated residence hall to eventually receive LEED recognition. [130] The total cost of The Commons construction project is expected to be over $150 million. [131] In the summer of 2012, the university demolished the pre-existing dormitories known as the Kissam Quadrangle and broke ground on the Warren and Moore residential colleges, a new living and learning community following the system of the Commons. The project cost $115 million and opened its doors in August 2014. [132]

Student controversies
On November 4, 2010, two anonymous former members of the Vanderbilt chapter, an alumnus and a senior student, alleged they were evicted from Beta Upsilon Chi , a Christian fraternity , for being gay. [133] [134] [135] [136]
In the wake of a U.S. Supreme Court decision in 2011, four Christian student organizations were placed on probation due to non-compliance with the university's nondiscrimination policy, which requires student groups to accept all students and forbids them from requiring that their officers share the "beliefs, goals and values" embodied in the group. [137] Controversy continued to surround this issue throughout 2011 and 2012, culminating in a proposed state law exempting student organizations from nondiscrimination policies. Although the bill passed both houses of the Tennessee Legislature , it was vetoed by Governor Bill Haslam . [138]
In March 2015, three swastikas , a symbol of Nazi antisemitism , were found spray-painted in the elevator and basement inside the house of Alpha Epsilon Pi , one of the historically Jewish fraternities on campus. [139] [140] [141] The campus Hillel chapter called it "a malicious attack intended to bring to mind the horrors of the Holocaust , to force us to feel different, endangered and isolated." [142] The news, characterized as a " hate crime " by university officials, made national and international headlines, including in Israel. [139] [140] [141]
A 2015 survey reported that 20% of undergraduate students were sexually assaulted in 2014–2015. [143] Meanwhile, as of 2015, The Tennessean reports that the university is "under review by federal education officials, spurred by six current and former female students who filed a complaint about how Vanderbilt has handled cases of sexual misconduct." [143]
In April 2016 and June 2016, two former Vanderbilt football players were found guilty of charges related to the videotaped rape of an unconscious woman in a dorm room. [144] Cory Batey was convicted of aggravated rape, aggravated sexual battery, facilitation of aggravated rape, and attempted aggravated rape, [145] while Brandon Vandenburg was convicted of aggravated rape, aggravated sexual battery, and unlawful photography. [144] [146] The two are among four former football players charged with crimes related to the case. [147]

Athletics
Vanderbilt is a charter member of the Southeastern Conference and for a half-century has been the conference's only private school. [148] The university fields six men's and nine women's intercollegiate teams. [149] [150] With fewer than 6,600 undergraduates, the school is also the smallest in the conference; the SEC's next-smallest school, the University of Mississippi , has nearly twice as many undergraduate students. Additionally, the school is a member of the Big East Conference for women's lacrosse , as the SEC does not sponsor that sport. Conversely, Vanderbilt is the only league school not to field teams in softball and volleyball , but has discussed adding either or both sports in the future. [151]
Men's and women's tennis and men's and women's basketball are traditionally Vanderbilt's strongest sports. Both basketball teams play in quirky Memorial Gym , built in 1952. [152] The homecourt advantage Vanderbilt has enjoyed has been nicknamed "Memorial Magic". [153] The women's tennis team won the NCAA national championship in 2015.
In February 2016, the university was fined $100,000 by the Southeastern Conference after fans stormed the basketball court following a win. [154]

Athletics restructuring
The university is unique in NCAA Division I in that for several years the athletics department was not administered separately from other aspects of campus life; Vice Chancellor David Williams, who was over intercollegiate athletics, also was university counsel and in charge of other aspects of undergraduate campus life such as intramural sports. [155] Despite fears that Vanderbilt would lose coaches and recruits or would be forced out of the SEC, the university experienced considerable success after the change; 2006–07 was one of the best in the school's athletic history. At one point, seven of Vanderbilt's 16 teams were concurrently ranked in the Top 25 of their respective sports. [156] Women's bowling won the NCAA championship, bringing the university its first team championship since the advent of the NCAA. [157] The baseball team qualified for the NCAA Super Regionals in 2004, had the nation's top recruiting class in 2005 according to Baseball America , [158] made the NCAA field again in 2006, and won the 2007 SEC regular-season and tournament championships and won the NCAA college world series in 2014 (the university's only men's national championship). Vanderbilt was ranked first in most polls for a large portion of the 2007 season, and the team secured the top seed in the 2007 NCAA tournament ., [159] However, following the departure of former Chancellor Gordon Gee to return to Ohio State University , the experiment was phased out and Williams has officially been given the formal title of athletic director and slowly relieved of his other responsibilities in order to allow him to concentrate on this role on a full-time basis. [ citation needed ]

Mascot
Vanderbilt's intercollegiate athletics teams are nicknamed the Commodores, in honor of the nickname given to Cornelius Vanderbilt, who made his fortune in shipping. [160] The term commodore was used by the Navy during the mid-to-late 19th century. A commodore was the commanding officer of a task force of ships, and therefore higher in rank than a captain but lower in rank than an admiral. The rank is still used by the British Royal Navy and other Commonwealth countries, but the equivalent modern-day rank in the U.S. Navy is rear admiral lower half . Since the term was used most during the 19th century, Vanderbilt's mascot, "Mr. C", is usually portrayed as a naval officer from the late 19th century, complete with mutton chops , cutlass , and uniform.
In addition to Mr. C, Vanderbilt fans often use the cheer "Anchor down!" accompanied by the "VU" hand sign, created by extending the thumb along with the index and middle fingers. [161]

Notable faculty and alumni
Notable alumni and affiliates include two Vice Presidents of the United States , an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court , 26 Rhodes Scholars , five Nobel Prize laureates, [162] Fields Medal winners, Pulitzer Prize winners, Emmy Award winners, and Academy Award winners. [163] [164] [165]
Vanderbilt has approximately 114,000 living alumni, with 31 alumni clubs established worldwide. [8] Many Vanderbilt alumni have gone on to make significant contributions in politics. Lamar Alexander ( B.A. 1962) is a current U.S. Senator, former Governor of Tennessee , former U.S. Secretary of Education , and former U.S. presidential candidate; he filled the Senate seat left vacant by the retirement of Fred Thompson (J.D. 1971). [166] Two U.S. vice presidents , John Nance Garner and Al Gore , attended the university, but did not graduate. [167] [168] However, Gore's ex-wife, Tipper , is herself an alumna, receiving a master's degree from Peabody in 1975. [169] Other alumni who are or have been involved in politics include former United States Supreme Court Associate Justice and former U.S. Attorney General James Clark McReynolds (B.S. 1882), Executive Vice President of the Cato Institute David Boaz (B.A. 1975), [166] [170] and former White House Chief of Staff John R. Steelman (M.A. 1924). Bill Frist , a cardiothoracic surgeon and former U.S. Senate Majority Leader , is a faculty member at Vanderbilt University Medical Center . Hiram Wesley Evans , who served as the Imperial Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan from 1922 to 1939, was also a Vanderbilt graduate. [171] Two heads of government are alumni. Abdiweli Mohamed Ali , former Prime Minister of Somalia and current President of Puntland received his master's degree from Vanderbilt; Chung Won-shik , former Prime Minister of South Korea , is a master's and doctorate alum.

Within the business world, Vanderbilt counts five billionaire alumni, among many others who have gone on to serve in a number of key leadership roles; alumni include Ann S. Moore (B.A. 1971), former Chairman and CEO of Time Inc. ; Doug Parker (M.B.A. 1986), President and CEO of US Airways ; and Matthew J. Hart (B.A. 1974), former President/COO of Hilton Hotels . [173] Vanderbilt also has an intimate connection to the contemporary management consulting industry. In particular, the founders of two of the three most prominent management consulting firms graduated with undergraduate degrees from the university. Bruce Henderson , founder of The Boston Consulting Group , graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering in 1937, [174] while Bill Bain , founder of Bain and Company , graduated in 1959 with Phi Beta Kappa honors in history. Jane Silber , the current CEO of Canonical, Ltd. , received a graduate degree from Vanderbilt. Thomas W. Beasley , the co-founder of the Corrections Corporation of America , graduated from the Vanderbilt Law School; he has been honored as a "Distinguished Alumni". [44] [175]
Three alumni, biochemist Stanford Moore (B.A. 1935), economist and microcredit pioneer Muhammad Yunus ( Ph.D. 1971), and former Vice President Al Gore have won the Nobel Prize . [176] [177] Four current or former members of the faculty also share that distinction: biochemist Stanley Cohen , physiologist Earl Sutherland , and pioneer molecular biologist Max Delbrück ; [8] Nobel laureate and neuroscientist Paul Greengard was a visiting scholar. Alain Connes and Vaughan Jones , both Fields Medalists , are Distinguished Professors of Mathematics at the university. In addition, the university has a rich literary and journalistic legacy. Most notably, the Southern Agrarians were a group of influential American writers and poets in the 1920s and 1930s based at Vanderbilt. Three U.S. Poets Laureate are Vanderbilt alums: Allen Tate (B.A. 1922), Robert Penn Warren (B.A. 1925), and Randall Jarrell (M.A. 1938). Warren later went on to win the Pulitzer Prize for fiction and for poetry. Novelists James Dickey (B.A. 1949) and James Patterson (M.A. 1970) also graduated from Vanderbilt. [178] Two well-known sportswriters, Grantland Rice (B.A. 1901) and Fred Russell (B.A. 1927), have a scholarship named after them at the university, [179] and Buster Olney (B.A. 1988) writes for ESPN.com and The New York Times . [180] Journalist David Brinkley attended briefly. [181] Skip Bayless (B.A. 1974), formerly of ESPN First Take , attended Vanderbilt as a recipient of the Russell-Rice scholarship. [180] Willie Geist (B.A. 1997) is a host of MSNBC 's Morning Joe . Vanderbilt alumna Hildy Kuryk is the director of communications at Vogue and former senior New York finance consultant for Barack Obama 's 2008 presidential campaign. [182] [183] [184]
Former Chicago Bears quarterback Jay Cutler (B.S. 2005) is also a Vanderbilt alum and was drafted in the first round of the 2006 NFL Draft by the Denver Broncos . Cutler's teammate and offensive tackle Chris Williams (B.S. 2008) was a first round pick by the Bears in 2008. Vanderbilt also produced the first overall draft picks of Major League Baseball in 2007 and 2015, with David Price and Dansby Swanson , the second overall draft pick of Major League Baseball in 2008 with Pedro Alvarez and the seventh overall draft pick in 2009 with Mike Minor . Price, Alvarez and Minor were drafted by the then-named Tampa Bay Devil Rays , Pittsburgh Pirates and Atlanta Braves , respectively. Pitcher Josh Zeid made his major league debut with the Houston Astros in 2013. ESPN basketball analyst Carolyn Peck was a standout member of the Commodores' basketball program from 1985–1988, eventually becoming a head coach and leading the Purdue Boilermakers women's basketball team to a national championship in 1999. Festus Ezeli (B.A. 2012) won an NBA championship with the Golden State Warriors .
Many of its alumni became involved in the music industry, likely given the university's location in Nashville. Dinah Shore (B.A. 1938), Rosanne Cash (B.A. 1979), Amy Grant (B.A. 1982), and Dierks Bentley (B.A. 1997) are all alumni. [178] Shore later went on to star in a variety of films and radio and television series; other Vanderbilt alumni with Hollywood connections include Academy Award-winners Delbert Mann (B.A. 1941) and Tom Schulman (B.A. 1972) and Joe Bob Briggs (B.A. 1974).

Notability in the English Wikipedia
In the English version of the online encyclopedia Wikipedia , notability is a criterion to determine whether a topic merits a separate wikipedia article. It is described in the guideline Wikipedia:Notability
In general, notability is an attempt to assess whether the topic has "gained sufficiently significant attention by the world at large and over a period of time [1] as evidenced by significant coverage in reliable secondary sources that are independent of the topic. [2]

History
The language of the criterion was modified and adapted to produce notability guidance in specific subject areas, before being introduced into the proposed notability guideline in September 2006. In response to growing concerns in 2006 about issues specifically affecting biographies of living persons, Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales introduced a notability criterion via the core policy of " What Wikipedia Is Not ". Wales commented that "I added Wikipedia is not a newspaper and especially not a tabloid newspaper and that we… attempt to make some sort of judgment about the long term historical notability of something…". [3] The criterion was subsequently refined into this Notability guideline; [ citation needed ] Wales was unsure if the policy changes would be accepted, but within weeks the policy had been "refined, copyedited, and extended to include heuristics for determining long-term notability". [3]

Criteria

Sourcing
Notability should be demonstrated using reliable sources according to the corresponding Wikipedia guideline. Reliable sources generally include mainstream news media and major academic journals, and exclude self-published sources, particularly when self-published on the internet. The foundation of this theory is that such sources "exercise some form of editorial control." [4]
Verifiability, or the ability for the reader to confirm that content corresponds to the cited source, is the standard. "Gather references both to use as source(s) of your information and also to demonstrate notability of your article's subject matter. References to blogs, personal websites and MySpace don't count – we need reliable sources." [4]
Content not based on reliable sources may be deemed original research , which is prohibited on Wikipedia. "A correlate to this notability criterion, crucial to the identity of the site, is the prohibition on original research, including the synthesis of previously published material." [2]

Rules
As the Wikipedia community has grown, its rules have in turn become more complex, a trend known as instruction creep . [5] This trend is reflected in the development and increasing complexity of the notability guidelines, with various special notability guidelines being proposed for specific topic areas, including notability criteria for porn stars. [6]
Commentators have stressed the novelty of the notability criterion, which makes Wikipedia the first encyclopedia to openly discuss criteria for inclusion: "For the first time in history, a broad open discussion about "encyclopedia notability" has been started that has already given rise to intensive debates and detailed – while still unfinished and unofficial – lists of possible criteria." [7]

Controversies
Two polarized perspectives on notability are commonly known as "inclusionism" and "deletionism" .
In one instance, a group of editors agreed that many articles on webcomics should be deleted on the grounds that the various topics lacked notability. Some of the comic artists concerned reacted negatively, accusing editors of being "wannabe tin-pot dictators masquerading as humble editors." [5] Nicholson Baker noted that by 2007, notability disputes had spread into other topics, including companies, places, websites, and people. [5]
Timothy Noah wrote several articles in 2007 about the threatened deletion of his entry on grounds of his insufficient notability. He concluded that "Wikipedia's notability policy resembles U.S. immigration policy before 9/11: stringent rules, spotty enforcement." [6] David Segal observed that "Wiki-worthiness has quietly become a new digital divide, separating those who think they are notable from those granted the imprimatur of notability by a horde of anonymous geeks." [8]
A criticism by Professor Hans Gese is that "Wikipedia sees itself as a publication that relies on reputation that has already been produced ex ante : especially when it is based on consensual mass media judgment or—in the case of lesser known individuals—on different smaller, but mutually independent sources. Of course, this policy does not acknowledge that a Wikipedia entry may itself become a factor in reputation building: especially when the information that this entry exists is propagated by journalists and other potent 'multiplicators'". [7] Gese also refers, in more general terms, to the same effect described by Segal, that "a Wikipedia article may soon be considered as an indicator of relevance, eminence, popularity and reputation - for persons as well as for music bands, art works, localities, historical events and any kind of voluntary association". [7]

Arbitration Committee
The Arbitration Committee of the English Wikipedia is a panel of editors responsible for conducting arbitration to resolve serious disputes between editors of the encyclopedia. The committee has the authority to impose binding sanctions, and also determines which users have access to special permissions.
It was created by Jimmy Wales on December 4, 2003, as an extension of the decision-making power he formerly held as owner of the site. [1] [2] The committee acts as a court of last resort (described in the media variously as 'quasi- judicial ' or a Wikipedian 'High/ Supreme Court ', though the Committee makes it clear that it is not, nor pretends to be, a court of law in the formal sense) for disputes among editors. It has decided several hundred cases in its history. [3] Members of the Committee are appointed by Wales either in person or email following advisory elections; Wales generally chooses to appoint arbitrators who were among those who received the most votes. [4]
The Committee has been examined by academics researching dispute resolution , and also reported in public media in connection with various case decisions and Wikipedia-related controversies. [2] [5] [6]

History
In October 2003, as part of an etiquette discussion on Wikipedia, Alex T. Roshuk , then legal adviser to the Wikimedia Foundation , drafted a 1,300 word outline of mediation and arbitration. This outline evolved into the twin Mediation Committee and Arbitration Committee, formally announced by Jimmy Wales on December 4, 2003. [2] [7] Over time the concept of an "Arbitration Committee" was adopted by other communities within the Wikimedia Foundation's hosted projects.
When founded, the Committee consisted of 12 arbitrators divided into three groups of four members each. [1] [8] As of 2008 [update] , it had decided around 371 conduct cases, with remedies varying from warnings to bans. [9] [10]

Attention and controversies
A statistical study published in the Emory Law Journal in 2010 indicated that the Committee has generally adhered to the principles of ignoring the content of user disputes and focusing on user conduct. [2] The same study also found that despite every case being assessed on its own merits, a correlation emerged between the types of conduct found to have occurred and the remedies and decisions imposed by the Committee.
In 2007, an arbitrator using the username Essjay resigned from the Committee after it was found that he had made false claims about his academic qualifications and professional experiences in a New York Times interview. [11] [12] [13] Also in 2007, the committee banned Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Carl Hewitt from editing the online encyclopedia. [14] In May 2009, an arbitrator who edited under the username Sam Blacketer resigned from the Committee after it became known that he had concealed his past editing in obtaining the role. [5]
In 2009, the Committee was brought to media attention as a result of its decision to ban "all IP addresses owned or operated by the Church of Scientology and its associates, broadly interpreted", as part of the fourth Scientology-related case. [3] [15] Such an action had "little precedent" [3] in the eight-year history of Wikipedia and was reported on several major news services such as The New York Times , ABC News , and The Guardian . [3] [15] [16] Satirical news-show host Stephen Colbert ran a segment on The Colbert Report parodying the ban. [17]
In 2015, the Committee received attention for its ruling pertaining to Gamergate , in which one editor was banned from the site indefinitely and several others were banned from topics relating to Gamergate or gender. [18]
In June 2015, the committee removed advanced permissions from Richard Symonds, an activist for the Liberal Democrats. [19] Symonds had improperly blocked a Wikipedia account, and associated its edits with former Chairman of the Conservative Party Grant Shapps , [20] and leaked this to The Guardian . [19] Shapps denied ownership of the account, calling the allegations "categorically false and defamatory". [21] Symonds said in an interview that he stands by his actions. [22]

Arbitration Committees on sister projects
In 2004 an Arbitration Committee was founded on the French Wikipedia , [23] and in 2007, on the German [24] and Polish Wikipedias. [25]

Germany
Coordinates : 51°N 9°E ﻿ / ﻿ 51°N 9°E ﻿ / 51; 9
Germany ( i / ˈ dʒ ɜːr m ə n i / ; German : Deutschland , pronounced [ˈdɔʏtʃlant] ), officially the Federal Republic of Germany (German: Bundesrepublik Deutschland , listen ( help · info ) ), [d] [8] is a federal parliamentary republic in central - western Europe . It includes 16 constituent states , covers an area of 357,021 square kilometres (137,847 sq mi), and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union . After the United States , it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. [9] [10] Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin , while its largest conurbation is the Ruhr (main centres: Dortmund and Essen ). The country's other major cities are Hamburg , Munich , Cologne , Frankfurt , Stuttgart , Düsseldorf , Leipzig , Bremen , Dresden , Hannover and Nuremberg .
Various Germanic tribes have inhabited the northern parts of modern Germany since classical antiquity . A region named Germania was documented before 100 AD. During the Migration Period the Germanic tribes expanded southward. Beginning in the 10th century, German territories formed a central part of the Holy Roman Empire . [11] During the 16th century, northern German regions became the centre of the Protestant Reformation . The remains of the Holy Roman Empire formed the German Confederation in 1815, while the German revolutions of 1848–49 established major democratic rights first.
In 1871, Germany became a nation state when most of the German states were unified into the Prussian -dominated German Empire . After World War I and the German Revolution of 1918–1919 , the Empire was replaced by the parliamentary Weimar Republic . In 1933 the Nazi seizure of power quickly led to the establishment of Nazi Germany which was built upon a dictatorship and consequently led to World War II and one of the biggest genocides in history, the Holocaust . By 1945 Germany and most of Europe were left in destruction and ruins . After the end of World War II in Europe and a period of Allied occupation , two German states were founded: the democratic Federal Republic of Germany (commonly known as West Germany) and the socialist German Democratic Republic (commonly known as East Germany). A wall encircling West Berlin was created on August 13, 1961, and was torn down on November 9, 1989. On 3 October 1990 , the country was reunified . [12]
In the 21st century, Germany is a great power and has the world's fourth-largest economy by nominal GDP , as well as the fifth-largest by PPP . As a global leader in several industrial and technological sectors, it is both the world's third-largest exporter and importer of goods. Germany is a developed country with a very high standard of living sustained by a skilled and productive society. It upholds a social security and universal health care system, environmental protection and a tuition-free university education . [13]
The Federal Republic of Germany was a founding member of the European Economic Community in 1957 and the European Union in 1993. It is part of the Schengen Area , and became a co-founder of the Eurozone in 1999. Germany is a member of the United Nations , NATO , the G8 , the G20 , and the OECD . The national military expenditure is the 9th highest in the world. Known for its rich cultural history, Germany has been continuously the home of influential and successful artists , philosophers , musicians , sportspeople , entrepreneurs , scientists, engineers, and inventors .

Etymology
The English word Germany derives from the Latin Germania , which came into use after Julius Caesar adopted it for the peoples east of the Rhine . [14] The German term Deutschland , originally diutisciu land ("the German lands") is derived from deutsch (cf. dutch ), descended from Old High German diutisc "popular" (i.e. belonging to the diot or diota "people"), originally used to distinguish the language of the common people from Latin and its Romance descendants . This in turn descends from Proto-Germanic * þiudiskaz "popular" (see also the Latinised form Theodiscus ), derived from * þeudō , descended from Proto-Indo-European * tewtéh₂- "people", from which the word "Teutons" also originates. [15]

History
The discovery of the Mauer 1 mandible shows that ancient humans were present in Germany at least 600,000 years ago. [16] The oldest complete hunting weapons found anywhere in the world were discovered in a coal mine in Schöningen where three 380,000-year-old wooden javelins were unearthed. [17] The Neander Valley was the location where the first ever non-modern human fossil was discovered; the new species of human was called the Neanderthal . The Neanderthal 1 fossils are known to be 40,000 years old. Evidence of modern humans, similarly dated, has been found in caves in the Swabian Jura near Ulm. The finds include 42,000-year-old bird bone and mammoth ivory flutes which are the oldest musical instruments ever found, [18] the 40,000-year-old Ice Age Lion Man which is the oldest uncontested figurative art ever discovered, [19] and the 35,000-year-old Venus of Hohle Fels which is the oldest uncontested human figurative art ever discovered. [20] The Nebra sky disk is a bronze artifact created during the European Bronze Age attributed to a site near Nebra , Saxony-Anhalt . It is part of UNESCO 's Memory of the World Programme . [21]

Germanic tribes and Frankish Empire
The Germanic tribes are thought to date from the Nordic Bronze Age or the Pre-Roman Iron Age . From southern Scandinavia and north Germany, they expanded south, east and west from the 1st century BC, coming into contact with the Celtic tribes of Gaul as well as Iranian , Baltic , and Slavic tribes in Central and Eastern Europe . [22] Under Augustus , Rome began to invade Germania (an area extending roughly from the Rhine to the Ural Mountains ). In 9 AD, three Roman legions led by Varus were defeated by the Cheruscan leader Arminius . By 100 AD, when Tacitus wrote Germania , Germanic tribes had settled along the Rhine and the Danube (the Limes Germanicus ), occupying most of the area of modern Germany; Austria, Baden Württemberg , southern Bavaria , southern Hessen and the western Rhineland , however, were Roman provinces. [23]
In the 3rd century a number of large West Germanic tribes emerged: Alemanni , Franks , Chatti , Saxons , Frisii , Sicambri , and Thuringii . Around 260, the Germanic peoples broke into Roman-controlled lands. [24] After the invasion of the Huns in 375, and with the decline of Rome from 395, Germanic tribes moved further south-west. Simultaneously several large tribes formed in what is now Germany and displaced or absorbed smaller Germanic tribes. Large areas known since the Merovingian period as Austrasia , Neustria , and Aquitaine were conquered by the Franks who established the Frankish Kingdom , and pushed further east to subjugate Saxony and Bavaria . Areas of what is today the eastern part of Germany were inhabited by Western Slavic tribes of Sorbs , Veleti and the Obotritic confederation . [23]

East Francia and Holy Roman Empire
In 800, the Frankish king Charlemagne was crowned emperor and founded the Carolingian Empire , which was later divided in 843 among his heirs. [25] Following the break up of the Frankish Realm, for 900 years, the history of Germany was intertwined with the history of the Holy Roman Empire , [26] which subsequently emerged from the eastern portion of Charlemagne's original empire. The territory initially known as East Francia stretched from the Rhine in the west to the Elbe River in the east and from the North Sea to the Alps . [25]
The Ottonian rulers (919–1024) consolidated several major duchies and the German king Otto I was crowned Holy Roman Emperor of these regions in 962. In 996 Gregory V became the first German Pope, appointed by his cousin Otto III , whom he shortly after crowned Holy Roman Emperor. The Holy Roman Empire absorbed northern Italy and Burgundy under the reign of the Salian emperors (1024–1125), although the emperors lost power through the Investiture Controversy . [27]
In the 12th century, under the Hohenstaufen emperors (1138–1254), German princes increased their influence further south and east into territories inhabited by Slavs ; they encouraged German settlement in these areas, called the eastern settlement movement ( Ostsiedlung ) . Members of the Hanseatic League , which included mostly north German cities and towns, prospered in the expansion of trade. [28] In the south, the Greater Ravensburg Trade Corporation ( Große Ravensburger Handelsgesellschaft ) served a similar function. The edict of the Golden Bull issued in 1356 by Emperor Charles IV provided the basic constitutional structure of the Empire and codified the election of the emperor by seven prince-electors who ruled some of the most powerful principalities and archbishoprics. [29]
Population declined in the first half of the 14th century, starting with the Great Famine in 1315, followed by the Black Death of 1348–50. [30] Despite the decline, however, German artists, engineers, and scientists developed a wide array of techniques similar to those used by the Italian artists and designers of the time who flourished in such merchant city-states as Venice , Florence and Genoa . Artistic and cultural centres throughout the German states produced such artists as the Augsburg painters Hans Holbein and his son , and Albrecht Dürer . Johannes Gutenberg introduced moveable-type printing to Europe, a development that laid the basis for the spread of learning to the masses . [31]
In 1517, the Wittenberg monk Martin Luther publicised The Ninety-Five Theses , challenging the Roman Catholic Church and initiating the Protestant Reformation . In 1555, the Peace of Augsburg established Lutheranism as an acceptable alternative to Catholicism, but also decreed that the faith of the prince was to be the faith of his subjects, a principle called Cuius regio, eius religio . The agreement at Augsburg failed to address other religious creed: for example, the Reformed faith was still considered a heresy and the principle did not address the possible conversion of an ecclesiastic ruler, such as happened in Electorate of Cologne in 1583. From the Cologne War until the end of the Thirty Years' Wars (1618–1648), religious conflict devastated German lands. [32] The latter reduced the overall population of the German states by about 30 per cent, and in some places, up to 80 per cent. [33] The Peace of Westphalia ended religious warfare among the German states. [32] German rulers were able to choose either Roman Catholicism, Lutheranism or the Reformed faith as their official religion after 1648. [34]
In the 18th century, the Holy Roman Empire consisted of approximately 1,800 territories . [35] The elaborate legal system initiated by a series of Imperial Reforms (approximately 1450–1555) created the Imperial Estates and provided for considerable local autonomy among ecclesiastical, secular, and hereditary states, reflected in Imperial Diet . The House of Habsburg held the imperial crown from 1438 until the death of Charles VI in 1740. Having no male heirs, he had convinced the Electors to retain Habsburg hegemony in the office of the emperor by agreeing to the Pragmatic Sanction . This was finally settled through the War of Austrian Succession ; in the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle , Charles VI's daughter Maria Theresa ruled the Empire as Empress Consort when her husband, Francis I , became Holy Roman Emperor. From 1740, the dualism between the Austrian Habsburg Monarchy and the Kingdom of Prussia dominated the German history.
In 1772, then again in 1793 and 1795, the two dominant German states of Prussia and Austria, along with the Russian Empire , agreed to the Partitions of Poland ; dividing among themselves the lands of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth . As a result of the partitions, millions of Polish speaking inhabitants fell under the rule of the two German monarchies. However, the annexed territories though incorporated into the Kingdom of Prussia and the Habsburg Realm, were not legally considered as a part of the Holy Roman Empire. [36] [37]
During the period of the French Revolutionary Wars , along with the arrival of the Napoleonic era and the subsequent final meeting of the Imperial Diet , most of the secular Free Imperial Cities were annexed by dynastic territories; the ecclesiastical territories were secularised and annexed. In 1806 the Imperium was dissolved; German states, particularly the Rhineland states , fell under the influence of France. Until 1815, France, Russia, Prussia and the Habsburgs competed for hegemony in the German states during the Napoleonic Wars . [38]

German Confederation and Empire
Following the fall of Napoleon , the Congress of Vienna (convened in 1814) founded the German Confederation ( Deutscher Bund ), a loose league of 39 sovereign states . The appointment of the Emperor of Austria as the permanent president of the Confederation reflected the Congress's failure to accept Prussia's influence among the German states, and acerbated the long-standing competition between the Hohenzollern and Habsburg interests. Disagreement within restoration politics partly led to the rise of liberal movements, followed by new measures of repression by Austrian statesman Metternich . The Zollverein , a tariff union, furthered economic unity in the German states. [39] National and liberal ideals of the French Revolution gained increasing support among many, especially young, Germans. The Hambach Festival in May 1832 was a main event in support of German unity , freedom and democracy. In the light of a series of revolutionary movements in Europe , which established a republic in France , intellectuals and commoners started the Revolutions of 1848 in the German states . King Frederick William IV of Prussia was offered the title of Emperor, but with a loss of power; he rejected the crown and the proposed constitution, leading to a temporary setback for the movement. [40]
King William I appointed Otto von Bismarck as the new Minister President of Prussia in 1862. Bismarck successfully concluded war on Denmark in 1864, which promoted German over Danish interests in the Jutland peninsula. The subsequent (and decisive) Prussian victory in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 enabled him to create the North German Confederation ( Norddeutscher Bund ) which excluded Austria from the federation's affairs. After the French defeat in the Franco-Prussian War , the German princes proclaimed the founding of the German Empire in 1871 at Versailles , uniting all scattered parts of Germany except Austria. Prussia was the dominant constituent state of the new empire; the Hohenzollern King of Prussia ruled as its concurrent Emperor, and Berlin became its capital. [40]
In the Gründerzeit period following the unification of Germany , Bismarck's foreign policy as Chancellor of Germany under Emperor William I secured Germany's position as a great nation by forging alliances, isolating France by diplomatic means, and avoiding war. Under Wilhelm II , Germany, like other European powers, took an imperialistic course, leading to friction with neighbouring countries. Most alliances in which Germany had previously been involved were not renewed. This resulted in creation of a dual alliance with the multinational realm of Austria-Hungary , promoting at least benevolent neutrality if not outright military support. Subsequently, the Triple Alliance of 1882 included Italy, completing a Central European geographic alliance that illustrated German, Austrian and Italian fears of incursions against them by France and/or Russia. Similarly, Britain, France and Russia also concluded alliances that would protect them against Habsburg interference with Russian interests in the Balkans or German interference against France. [41]
At the Berlin Conference in 1884, Germany claimed several colonies including German East Africa , German South West Africa , Togoland , and Kamerun . [42] Later, Germany further expanded its colonial empire to include German New Guinea , German Micronesia and German Samoa in the Pacific, and Kiautschou Bay in China. In what became known as the "First Genocide of the Twentieth-Century", between 1904 and 1907, the German colonial government in South West Africa (present-day Namibia ) ordered the annihilation of the local Herero and Namaqua peoples , as a punitive measure for an uprising against German colonial rule. In total, around 100,000 people—80% of the Herero and 50% of the Namaqua —perished from imprisonment in concentration camps , where the majority died of disease, abuse, and exhaustion, or from dehydration and starvation in the countryside after being deprived of food and water. [43] [44]
The assassination of Austria's crown prince on 28 June 1914 provided the pretext for the Austrian Empire to attack Serbia and trigger World War I . After four years of warfare, in which approximately two million German soldiers were killed, [45] a general armistice ended the fighting on 11 November, and German troops returned home. In the German Revolution (November 1918), Emperor Wilhelm II and all German ruling princes abdicated their positions and responsibilities. Germany's new political leadership signed the Treaty of Versailles in 1919. In this treaty, Germany, as part of the Central Powers , accepted defeat by the Allies in one of the bloodiest conflicts of all time. Germans perceived the treaty as humiliating and unjust and it was later seen by historians as influential in the rise of Adolf Hitler . [46] [47] [48] After the defeat in the First World War, Germany lost around 13% of its European territory (areas predominantly inhabited by ethnic Polish, French and Danish populations, which were lost following the Greater Poland Uprising , the return of Alsace-Lorraine and the Schleswig plebiscites ), and all of its colonial possessions in Africa and the South Sea. [49]

Weimar Republic and Nazi Germany
Germany was declared a republic at the beginning of the German Revolution in November 1918. On 11 August 1919 President Friedrich Ebert signed the democratic Weimar Constitution . [50] In the subsequent struggle for power, the radical-left Communists seized power in Bavaria , but conservative elements in other parts of Germany attempted to overthrow the Republic in the Kapp Putsch . It was supported by parts of the Reichswehr (military) and other conservative, nationalistic and monarchist factions. After a tumultuous period of bloody street fighting in the major industrial centres, the occupation of the Ruhr by Belgian and French troops and the rise of inflation culminating in the hyperinflation of 1922–23 , a debt restructuring plan and the creation of a new currency in 1924 ushered in the Golden Twenties , an era of increasing artistic innovation and liberal cultural life. Underneath it all, though, lay a current of animosity and frustration over the Treaty of Versailles, widely perceived as a stab in the back , which provided the basis of much of the anti-Semitism rife in the next two decades. [51] The economic situation remained volatile. Historians describe the period between 1924 and 1929 as one of "partial stabilisation." [52] The worldwide Great Depression hit Germany in 1929. After the federal election of 1930 , Chancellor Heinrich Brüning 's government was enabled by President Paul von Hindenburg to act without parliamentary approval. Brüning's government pursued a policy of fiscal austerity and deflation which caused high unemployment of nearly 30% by 1932. [53]
The Nazi Party led by Adolf Hitler won the special federal election of 1932 . After a series of unsuccessful cabinets, Hindenburg appointed Hitler as Chancellor of Germany on 30 January 1933. [54] After the Reichstag fire , a decree abrogated basic civil rights and within weeks the first Nazi concentration camp at Dachau opened. [55] [56] The Enabling Act of 1933 gave Hitler unrestricted legislative power; subsequently, his government established a centralised totalitarian state , withdrew from the League of Nations following a national referendum, and began military rearmament. [57]
Using deficit spending, a government-sponsored programme for economic renewal focused on public works projects. In public work projects of 1934, 1.7 million Germans immediately were put to work, which gave them an income and social benefits. [58] The most famous of the projects was the high speed roadway, the Reichsautobahn , known as the German autobahns . [59] Other capital construction projects included hydroelectric facilities such as the Rur Dam , water supplies such as Zillierbach Dam , and transportation hubs such as Zwickau Hauptbahnhof . [60] Over the next five years, unemployment plummeted and average wages both per hour and per week rose. [61]
In 1935, the regime withdrew from the Treaty of Versailles and introduced the Nuremberg Laws which targeted Jews and other minorities. Germany also reacquired control of the Saar in 1935, [62] remilitarized the Rhineland in 1936, annexed Austria in 1938, annexed the Sudetenland in 1938 with the Munich Agreement and in direct violation of the agreement occupied Czechoslovakia with the proclamation of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia in March 1939.
Kristallnacht , or the "Night of Broken Glass", saw the burning of hundreds of synagogues, the destruction of thousands of Jewish businesses, and the arrest of around 30,000 Jewish men by Nazi forces inside Germany. Many Jewish women were arrested and placed in jails and a curfew was placed on the Jewish people in Germany. [63]
In August 1939, Hitler's government negotiated and signed the Molotov–Ribbentrop pact that divided Eastern Europe into German and Soviet spheres of influence. Following the agreement, on 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland , marking the beginning of World War II . [64] [65]
In response to Hitler's actions, two days later, on 3 September, after a British ultimatum to Germany to cease military operations was ignored, Britain and France declared war on Germany. [66] In the spring of 1940, Germany conquered Denmark and Norway , the Netherlands , Belgium , Luxembourg , and France forcing the French government to sign an armistice after German troops occupied most of the country. The British repelled German air attacks in the Battle of Britain in the same year. In 1941, German troops invaded Yugoslavia , Greece and the Soviet Union . By 1942, Germany and other Axis powers controlled most of continental Europe and North Africa , but following the Soviet Union's victory at the Battle of Stalingrad , the allies' reconquest of North Africa and invasion of Italy in 1943, German forces suffered repeated military defeats. [64] In June 1944, the Western allies landed in France and the Soviets pushed into Eastern Europe . By late 1944, the Western allies had entered Germany despite one final German counter offensive in the Ardennes Forest . Following Hitler's suicide during the Battle of Berlin , German armed forces surrendered on 8 May 1945, ending World War II in Europe. [67] After World War II , former members of the Nazi regime were tried for war crimes at the Nuremberg trials . [68] [69]
In what later became known as The Holocaust , the German government persecuted minorities and used a network of concentration and death camps across Europe to conduct a genocide of what they considered to be inferior peoples. In total, over 10 million civilians were systematically murdered, including 6 million Jews , between 220,000 and 1,500,000 Romani , 275,000 persons with disabilities , thousands of Jehovah's Witnesses , thousands of homosexuals , and hundreds of thousands of members of the political and religious opposition from Germany, and occupied countries ( Nacht und Nebel ). [70] Nazi policies in the German occupied countries resulted in the deaths of 2.7 million Poles , [71] 1.3 million Ukrainians , [72] and an estimated 2.8 million Soviet war prisoners . [72] [68] In addition, the Nazi regime abducted approximately 12 million people from across the German occupied Europe for use as slave labour in the German industry . [73] German military war casualties were estimated at between 3.2 million and 5.3 million soldiers, [74] and up to 2 million German civilians. [75] German territorial losses resulted in the expulsion of circa 12 million of ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe. Germany ceded roughly one-quarter of its pre-war territory . [12] Strategic bombing and land warfare destroyed many cities and cultural heritage sites.

East and West Germany
After Germany surrendered, the Allies partitioned Berlin and Germany's remaining territory into four military occupation zones. The western sectors, controlled by France, the United Kingdom, and the United States, were merged on 23 May 1949 to form the Federal Republic of Germany ( Bundesrepublik Deutschland ); on 7 October 1949, the Soviet Zone became the German Democratic Republic ( Deutsche Demokratische Republik ). They were informally known as West Germany and East Germany . East Germany selected East Berlin as its capital, while West Germany chose Bonn as a provisional capital, to emphasize its stance that the two-state solution was an artificial and temporary status quo. [76]
West Germany was established as a federal parliamentary republic with a " social market economy ". Starting in 1948 West Germany became a major recipient of reconstruction aid under the Marshall Plan and used this to rebuild its industry. [77] Konrad Adenauer was elected the first Federal Chancellor ( Bundeskanzler ) of Germany in 1949 and remained in office until 1963. Under his and Ludwig Erhard 's leadership, the country enjoyed prolonged economic growth beginning in the early 1950s, that became known as an " economic miracle " ( Wirtschaftswunder ). [78] The Federal Republic of Germany joined NATO in 1955 and was a founding member of the European Economic Community in 1957.
East Germany was an Eastern Bloc state under political and military control by the USSR via occupation forces and the Warsaw Pact . Although East Germany claimed to be a democracy, political power was exercised solely by leading members ( Politbüro ) of the communist-controlled Socialist Unity Party of Germany , supported by the Stasi , an immense secret service controlling many aspects of the society. [79] A Soviet-style command economy was set up and the GDR later became a Comecon state. [80] While East German propaganda was based on the benefits of the GDR's social programmes and the alleged constant threat of a West German invasion, many of its citizens looked to the West for freedom and prosperity. [81] The Berlin Wall , rapidly built on 13 August 1961 prevented East German citizens from escaping to West Germany, eventually becoming a symbol of the Cold War . [40] [82] Ronald Reagan 's " Mr. Gorbachov , Tear down this wall! " speech at the Wall on 12 June 1987 influenced public opinion, echoing John F. Kennedy 's famous Ich bin ein Berliner speech of 26 June 1963. The fall of the Wall in 1989 became a symbol of the Fall of Communism ,the Dissolution of the Soviet Union , German Reunification and Die Wende . [83]
Tensions between East and West Germany were reduced in the early 1970s by Chancellor Willy Brandt 's Ostpolitik . In summer 1989, Hungary decided to dismantle the Iron Curtain and open the borders, causing the emigration of thousands of East Germans to West Germany via Hungary. This had devastating effects on the GDR, where regular mass demonstrations received increasing support. The East German authorities eased the border restrictions, allowing East German citizens to travel to the West; originally intended to help retain East Germany as a state, the opening of the border actually led to an acceleration of the Wende reform process. This culminated in the Two Plus Four Treaty a year later on 12 September 1990, under which the four occupying powers renounced their rights under the Instrument of Surrender , and Germany regained full sovereignty. This permitted German reunification on 3 October 1990, with the accession of the five re-established states of the former GDR. [40]

Reunified Germany and European Union
The united Germany is considered to be the enlarged continuation of the Federal Republic of Germany and not a successor state . As such, it retained all of West Germany's memberships in international organisations. [85] Based on the Berlin/Bonn Act , adopted in 1994, Berlin once again became the capital of the reunified Germany, while Bonn obtained the unique status of a Bundesstadt (federal city) retaining some federal ministries. [86] The relocation of the government was completed in 1999. [87] Following the 1998 elections , SPD politician Gerhard Schröder became the first Chancellor of a red–green coalition with the Alliance '90/The Greens party. Among the major projects of the two Schröder legislatures was the Agenda 2010 to reform the labour market to become more flexible and reduce unemployment.
The modernisation and integration of the eastern German economy is a long-term process scheduled to last until the year 2019, with annual transfers from west to east amounting to roughly $80 billion. [88]
Since reunification, Germany has taken a more active role in the European Union . Together with its European partners Germany signed the Maastricht Treaty in 1992, established the Eurozone in 1999, and signed the Lisbon Treaty in 2007. [89] Germany sent a peacekeeping force to secure stability in the Balkans and sent a force of German troops to Afghanistan as part of a NATO effort to provide security in that country after the ousting of the Taliban . [90] These deployments were controversial since Germany was bound by domestic law only to deploy troops for defence roles. [91]
In the 2005 elections , Angela Merkel became the first female Chancellor of Germany as the leader of a grand coalition . [40] In 2009 the German government approved a €50 billion economic stimulus plan to protect several sectors from a downturn. [92]
In 2009, a liberal - conservative coalition under Merkel assumed leadership of the country. In 2013, a grand coalition was established in a Third Merkel cabinet . Among the major German political projects of the early 21st century are the advancement of European integration , the energy transition ( Energiewende ) for a sustainable energy supply, the " Debt Brake " for balanced budgets, measures to increase the fertility rate significantly ( pronatalism ), and high-tech strategies for the future transition of the German economy, summarised as Industry 4.0 . [93]
Germany was affected by the European migrant crisis in 2015 as it became the final destination of choice for many asylum seekers entering the EU. The country took in over a million refugees and developed a quota system which redistributed migrants around its federal states based on their tax income and existing population density. [94]

Geography
Germany is in Western and Central Europe , with Denmark bordering to the north, Poland and the Czech Republic to the east, Austria to the southeast, Switzerland to the south-southwest, France, Luxembourg and Belgium lie to the west, and the Netherlands to the northwest. It lies mostly between latitudes 47° and 55° N and longitudes 5° and 16° E . Germany is also bordered by the North Sea and, at the north-northeast, by the Baltic Sea. With Switzerland and Austria, Germany also shares a border on the fresh-water Lake Constance , the third largest lake in Central Europe. [95] German territory covers 357,021 km 2 (137,847 sq mi), consisting of 349,223 km 2 (134,836 sq mi) of land and 7,798 km 2 (3,011 sq mi) of water. It is the seventh largest country by area in Europe and the 62nd largest in the world . [96]
Elevation ranges from the mountains of the Alps (highest point: the Zugspitze at 2,962 metres or 9,718 feet) in the south to the shores of the North Sea ( Nordsee ) in the northwest and the Baltic Sea ( Ostsee ) in the northeast. The forested uplands of central Germany and the lowlands of northern Germany (lowest point: Wilstermarsch at 3.54 metres or 11.6 feet below sea level) are traversed by such major rivers as the Rhine , Danube and Elbe . Germany's alpine glaciers are experiencing deglaciation. Significant natural resources include iron ore, coal, potash , timber, lignite , uranium , copper, natural gas, salt, nickel, arable land and water. [96]

Climate
Most of Germany has a temperate seasonal climate dominated by humid westerly winds. The country is situated in between the oceanic Western European and the continental Eastern European climate. The climate is moderated by the North Atlantic Drift , the northern extension of the Gulf Stream . This warmer water affects the areas bordering the North Sea; consequently in the northwest and the north the climate is oceanic. Germany gets an average of 789 mm (31 in) of precipitation per year; there is no consistent dry season. Winters are cool and summers tend to be warm: temperatures can exceed 30 °C (86 °F ). [97]
The east has a more continental climate: winters can be very cold and summers very warm, and longer dry periods can occur. Central and southern Germany are transition regions which vary from moderately oceanic to continental. In addition to the maritime and continental climates that predominate over most of the country, the Alpine regions in the extreme south and, to a lesser degree, some areas of the Central German Uplands have a mountain climate, with lower temperatures and more precipitation. [97]

Biodiversity
The territory of Germany can be subdivided into two ecoregions : European-Mediterranean montane mixed forests and Northeast-Atlantic shelf marine. [98] As of 2008 [update] the majority of Germany is covered by either arable land (34%) or forest and woodland (30.1%); only 13.4% of the area consists of permanent pastures , 11.8% is covered by settlements and streets . [99]
Plants and animals include those generally common to Central Europe. Beeches , oaks , and other deciduous trees constitute one-third of the forests; conifers are increasing as a result of reforestation . Spruce and fir trees predominate in the upper mountains, while pine and larch are found in sandy soil. There are many species of ferns , flowers , fungi , and mosses . Wild animals include roe deer , wild boar , mouflon (a subspecies of wild sheep), fox , badger , hare , and small numbers of the Eurasian beaver . [100] The blue cornflower was once a German national symbol . [101]
The 16 national parks in Germany include the Jasmund National Park , the Vorpommern Lagoon Area National Park , the Müritz National Park , the Wadden Sea National Parks , the Harz National Park , the Hainich National Park , the Black Forest National Park , the Saxon Switzerland National Park , the Bavarian Forest National Park and the Berchtesgaden National Park . In addition, there are 15 Biosphere Reserves , as well as 98 nature parks . More than 400 registered zoos and animal parks operate in Germany, which is believed to be the largest number in any country. [102] The Berlin Zoo , opened in 1844, is the oldest zoo in Germany, and presents the most comprehensive collection of species in the world. [103]

Urbanisation
Germany has a number of large cities . There are 11 officially recognised metropolitan regions in Germany . 34 cities have been identified as regiopolis . The largest conurbation is the Rhine-Ruhr region (11.7 million in 2008 [update] ), including Düsseldorf (the capital of North Rhine-Westphalia ), Cologne , Bonn , Dortmund , Essen , Duisburg , and Bochum . [104]

Politics
Germany is a federal , parliamentary , representative democratic republic. The German political system operates under a framework laid out in the 1949 constitutional document known as the Grundgesetz (Basic Law). Amendments generally require a two-thirds majority of both chambers of parliament; the fundamental principles of the constitution, as expressed in the articles guaranteeing human dignity, the separation of powers, the federal structure, and the rule of law are valid in perpetuity. [105]
The president , Frank-Walter Steinmeier (19 March 2017–present), is the head of state and invested primarily with representative responsibilities and powers. He is elected by the Bundesversammlung (federal convention), an institution consisting of the members of the Bundestag and an equal number of state delegates. The second-highest official in the German order of precedence is the Bundestagspräsident ( President of the Bundestag ), who is elected by the Bundestag and responsible for overseeing the daily sessions of the body. The third-highest official and the head of government is the Chancellor, who is appointed by the Bundespräsident after being elected by the Bundestag . [40]
The chancellor, Angela Merkel (22 November 2005–present), is the head of government and exercises executive power , similar to the role of a Prime Minister in other parliamentary democracies. Federal legislative power is vested in the parliament consisting of the Bundestag (Federal Diet) and Bundesrat (Federal Council), which together form the legislative body. The Bundestag is elected through direct elections , by proportional representation ( mixed-member ). [96] The members of the Bundesrat represent the governments of the sixteen federated states and are members of the state cabinets. [40]
Since 1949, the party system has been dominated by the Christian Democratic Union and the Social Democratic Party of Germany . So far every chancellor has been a member of one of these parties. However, the smaller liberal Free Democratic Party (in parliament from 1949 to 2013) and the Alliance '90/The Greens (in parliament since 1983) have also played important roles. [106]
The debt-to-GDP ratio of Germany had its peak in 2010 when it stood at 80.3% and decreased since then. [107] According to Eurostat , the government gross debt of Germany amounts to €2,152.0 billion or 71.9% of its GDP in 2015. [108] The federal government achieved a budget surplus of €12.1 billion ($13.1 billion) in 2015. [109] Germany's credit rating by credit rating agencies Standard & Poor's , Moody's and Fitch Ratings stands at the highest possible rating AAA with a stable outlook in 2016. [110]

Law
Germany has a civil law system based on Roman law with some references to Germanic law . The Bundesverfassungsgericht (Federal Constitutional Court) is the German Supreme Court responsible for constitutional matters, with power of judicial review . [40] [111] Germany's supreme court system, called Oberste Gerichtshöfe des Bundes , is specialised: for civil and criminal cases, the highest court of appeal is the inquisitorial Federal Court of Justice , and for other affairs the courts are the Federal Labour Court , the Federal Social Court , the Federal Finance Court and the Federal Administrative Court .
Criminal and private laws are codified on the national level in the Strafgesetzbuch and the Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch respectively. The German penal system seeks the rehabilitation of the criminal and the protection of the public. [112] Except for petty crimes, which are tried before a single professional judge, and serious political crimes , all charges are tried before mixed tribunals on which lay judges ( Schöffen ) sit side by side with professional judges. [113] [114] Many of the fundamental matters of administrative law remain in the jurisdiction of the states.
Germany has a low murder rate with 0.9 murders per 100,000 in 2014. [115]

Constituent states
Germany comprises sixteen federal states which are collectively referred to as Bundesländer . [116] Each state has its own state constitution [117] and is largely autonomous in regard to its internal organisation. Two of the states are city-states consisting of just one city: Berlin and Hamburg . The state of Bremen consists of two cities that are separated from each other by the state of Lower Saxony : Bremen and Bremerhaven . Because of the differences in size and population the subdivisions of the states vary. For regional administrative purposes five states, namely Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Hesse, North Rhine-Westphalia and Saxony, consist of a total of 22 Government Districts ( Regierungsbezirke ). As of 2013 [update] Germany is divided into 402 districts ( Kreise ) at a municipal level; these consist of 295 rural districts and 107 urban districts . [118]

Foreign relations
Germany has a network of 227 diplomatic missions abroad [122] and maintains relations with more than 190 countries. [123] As of 2011 [update] , Germany is the largest contributor to the budget of the European Union (providing 20%) [124] and the third largest contributor to the UN (providing 8%). [125] Germany is a member of NATO , the OECD , the G8 , the G20 , the World Bank and the IMF . It has played an influential role in the European Union since its inception and has maintained a strong alliance with France and all neighbouring countries since 1990. Germany promotes the creation of a more unified European political, economic and security apparatus. [126] [127]
The development policy of Germany is an independent area of foreign policy. It is formulated by the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development and carried out by the implementing organisations. The German government sees development policy as a joint responsibility of the international community. [128] It was the world's third biggest aid donor in 2009 after the United States and France. [129] [130]
In 1999, Chancellor Gerhard Schröder 's government defined a new basis for German foreign policy by taking part in the NATO decisions surrounding the Kosovo War and by sending German troops into combat for the first time since 1945. [131] The governments of Germany and the United States are close political allies. [40] Cultural ties and economic interests have crafted a bond between the two countries resulting in Atlanticism . [132]

Military
Germany's military, the Bundeswehr , is organised into Heer (Army and special forces KSK ), Marine (Navy), Luftwaffe (Air Force), Bundeswehr Joint Medical Service and Streitkräftebasis (Joint Support Service) branches. In absolute terms, German military expenditure is the 9th highest in the world. [133] In 2015, military spending was at €32.9 billion, about 1.2% of the country's GDP, well below the NATO target of 2%. [134]
As of December 2015 [update] the Bundeswehr employed roughly 178,000 service members, including 9,500 volunteers. [135] Reservists are available to the Armed Forces and participate in defence exercises and deployments abroad. [136] Since 2001 women may serve in all functions of service without restriction. [137] About 19,000 female soldiers are on active duty. According to SIPRI , Germany was the fourth largest exporter of major arms in the world in 2014. [138]
In peacetime, the Bundeswehr is commanded by the Minister of Defence. In state of defence , the Chancellor would become commander-in-chief of the Bundeswehr . [139]
The role of the Bundeswehr is described in the Constitution of Germany as defensive only. But after a ruling of the Federal Constitutional Court in 1994 the term "defence" has been defined to not only include protection of the borders of Germany, but also crisis reaction and conflict prevention, or more broadly as guarding the security of Germany anywhere in the world. As of January 2015 [update] , the German military has about 2,370 troops stationed in foreign countries as part of international peacekeeping forces, including about 850 Bundeswehr troops in the NATO-led ISAF force in Afghanistan and Uzbekistan , 670 German soldiers in Kosovo , and 120 troops with UNIFIL in Lebanon. [140]
Until 2011, military service was compulsory for men at age 18, and conscripts served six-month tours of duty; conscientious objectors could instead opt for an equal length of Zivildienst (civilian service), or a six-year commitment to (voluntary) emergency services like a fire department or the Red Cross . In 2011 conscription was officially suspended and replaced with a voluntary service. [141] [142]

Economy
Germany has a social market economy with a highly skilled labour force , a large capital stock , a low level of corruption, [144] and a high level of innovation . [145] It is the world's third largest exporter of goods, [143] and has the largest national economy in Europe which is also the world's fourth largest by nominal GDP [146] and the fifth one by PPP . [147]
The service sector contributes approximately 71% of the total GDP (including information technology ), industry 28%, and agriculture 1%. [96] The unemployment rate published by Eurostat amounts to 4.7% in January 2015, which is the lowest rate of all 28 EU member states. [148] With 7.1% Germany also has the lowest youth unemployment rate of all EU member states. [148] According to the OECD Germany has one of the highest labour productivity levels in the world. [149]
Germany is part of the European single market which represents more than 508 million consumers. Several domestic commercial policies are determined by agreements among European Union (EU) members and by EU legislation. Germany introduced the common European currency, the Euro in 2002. [150] [151] It is a member of the Eurozone which represents around 338 million citizens. Its monetary policy is set by the European Central Bank , which is headquartered in Frankfurt , the financial centre of continental Europe.
Being home to the modern car , the automotive industry in Germany is regarded as one of the most competitive and innovative in the world, [152] and is the fourth largest by production . [153] The top 10 exports of Germany are vehicles, machinery, chemical goods, electronic products, electrical equipments, pharmaceuticals, transport equipments, basic metals, food products, and rubber and plastics. [154] Germany is the world's third-largest arms exporter . [155]

Companies
Of the world's 500 largest stock-market-listed companies measured by revenue in 2014, the Fortune Global 500 , 28 are headquartered in Germany. 30 Germany-based companies are included in the DAX , the German stock market index. Well-known international brands include Mercedes-Benz , BMW , SAP , Volkswagen , Audi , Siemens , Allianz , Adidas , Porsche , Deutsche Bahn , Deutsche Bank and Bosch . [156]
Germany is recognised for its large portion of specialised small and medium enterprises , known as the Mittelstand model. Around 1,000 of these companies are global market leaders in their segment and are labelled hidden champions . [157] Berlin developed a thriving, cosmopolitan hub for startup companies and became a leading location for venture capital funded firms in the European Union. [158]
The list includes the largest German companies by revenue in 2015: [159]

Transport
With its central position in Europe, Germany is a transport hub for the continent. [160] Like its neighbours in Western Europe, Germany's road network is among the densest in the world. [161] The motorway ( Autobahn ) network ranks as the third-largest worldwide in length and is known for its lack of a general speed limit. [162]
Germany has established a polycentric network of high-speed trains . The InterCityExpress or ICE network of the Deutsche Bahn serves major German cities as well as destinations in neighbouring countries with speeds up to 300 km/h (190 mph). [163] The German railways are subsidised by the government, receiving €17.0 billion in 2014. [164]
The largest German airports are Frankfurt Airport and Munich Airport , both hubs of Lufthansa , while Air Berlin has hubs at Berlin Tegel and Düsseldorf . Other major airports include Berlin Schönefeld , Hamburg , Cologne/Bonn and Leipzig/Halle . [165] The Port of Hamburg is one of the top twenty largest container ports in the world . [166]

Energy and infrastructure
In 2008 [update] , Germany was the world's sixth-largest consumer of energy, [167] and 60% of its primary energy was imported. [168] In 2014, energy sources were: oil (35.0%); coal, including lignite (24.6%); natural gas (20.5%); nuclear (8.1%); hydro-electric and renewable sources (11.1%). [169] The government and the nuclear power industry agreed to phase out all nuclear power plants by 2021. [170] It also enforces energy conservation , green technologies , emission reduction activities, [171] and aims to meet the country's electricity demands using 40% renewable sources by 2020. Germany is committed to the Kyoto protocol and several other treaties promoting biodiversity, low emission standards, water management , and the renewable energy commercialisation . [172] The country's household recycling rate is among the highest in the world—at around 65%. [173] Nevertheless, the country's total greenhouse gas emissions were the highest in the EU in 2010 [update] . [174] The German energy transition ( Energiewende ) is the recognised move to a sustainable economy by means of energy efficiency and renewable energy. [175]

Science and technology
Germany is a global leader in science and technology as its achievements in the fields of science and technology have been significant. Research and development efforts form an integral part of the economy . [176] The Nobel Prize has been awarded to 106 German laureates . [177] It produces the second highest number of graduates in science and engineering (31%) after South Korea . [178] In the beginning of the 20th century, German laureates had more awards than those of any other nation, especially in the sciences ( physics , chemistry , and physiology or medicine ). [179] [180]
Notable German physicists before the 20th century include Hermann von Helmholtz , Joseph von Fraunhofer and Gabriel Daniel Fahrenheit , among others. Albert Einstein introduced the special relativity and general relativity theories for light and gravity in 1905 and 1915 respectively. Along with Max Planck , he was instrumental in the introduction of quantum mechanics , in which Werner Heisenberg and Max Born later made major contributions. [181] Wilhelm Röntgen discovered X-rays . [182] Otto Hahn was a pioneer in the fields of radiochemistry and discovered nuclear fission , while Ferdinand Cohn and Robert Koch were founders of microbiology . Numerous mathematicians were born in Germany, including Carl Friedrich Gauss , David Hilbert , Bernhard Riemann , Gottfried Leibniz , Karl Weierstrass , Hermann Weyl and Felix Klein .
Germany has been the home of many famous inventors and engineers , including Hans Geiger , the creator of the Geiger counter ; and Konrad Zuse , who built the first fully automatic digital computer. [183] Such German inventors, engineers and industrialists as Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin , [184] Otto Lilienthal , Gottlieb Daimler , Rudolf Diesel , Hugo Junkers and Karl Benz helped shape modern automotive and air transportation technology. German institutions like the German Aerospace Center (DLR) are the largest contributor to ESA . Aerospace engineer Wernher von Braun developed the first space rocket at Peenemünde and later on was a prominent member of NASA and developed the Saturn V Moon rocket. Heinrich Rudolf Hertz 's work in the domain of electromagnetic radiation was pivotal to the development of modern telecommunication. [185]
Research institutions in Germany include the Max Planck Society , the Helmholtz Association and the Fraunhofer Society . The Wendelstein 7-X in Greifswald hosts a facility in the research of fusion power for instance. [186] The Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize is granted to ten scientists and academics every year. With a maximum of €2.5 million per award it is one of highest endowed research prizes in the world. [187]

Tourism
Germany is the seventh most visited country in the world, [188] with a total of 407 million overnights during 2012. [189] This number includes 68.83 million nights by foreign visitors. In 2012, over 30.4 million international tourists arrived in Germany. Berlin has become the third most visited city destination in Europe. [190] Additionally, more than 30% of Germans spend their holiday in their own country, with the biggest share going to Mecklenburg-Vorpommern . Domestic and international travel and tourism combined directly contribute over EUR43.2 billion to German GDP. Including indirect and induced impacts, the industry contributes 4.5% of German GDP and supports 2 million jobs (4.8% of total employment). [191]
Germany is well known for its diverse tourist routes, such as the Romantic Road , the Wine Route , the Castle Road , and the Avenue Road . The German Timber-Frame Road ( Deutsche Fachwerkstraße ) connects towns with examples of these structures. [192] [193]
Germany's most-visited landmarks include e.g. Neuschwanstein Castle , Cologne Cathedral , Berlin Bundestag , Hofbräuhaus Munich , Heidelberg Castle , Dresden Zwinger , Fernsehturm Berlin and Aachen Cathedral . The Europa-Park near Freiburg is Europe's second most popular theme park resort. [194]

Demographics
With a population of 80.2 million according to the 2011 census, [196] rising to 81.5 million as at 30 June 2015 [197] and to at least 81.9 million as at 31 December 2015, [198] Germany is the most populous country in the European Union, the second most populous country in Europe after Russia , and ranks as the 16th most populous country in the world. [199] Its population density stands at 227 inhabitants per square kilometre (588 per square mile). The overall life expectancy in Germany at birth is 80.19 years (77.93 years for males and 82.58 years for females). [96] The fertility rate of 1.41 children born per woman (2011 estimates), or 8.33 births per 1000 inhabitants, is one of the lowest in the world . [96] Since the 1970s, Germany's death rate has exceeded its birth rate . [200] However, Germany is witnessing increased birth rates and migration rates since the beginning of the 2010s, [201] particularly a rise in the number of well-educated migrants. [202] [203]
Four sizable groups of people are referred to as "national minorities" because their ancestors have lived in their respective regions for centuries. [204] There is a Danish minority (about 50,000) in the northernmost state of Schleswig-Holstein . [204] The Sorbs , a Slavic population of about 60,000, are in the Lusatia region of Saxony and Brandenburg . The Roma and Sinti live throughout the whole federal territory and the Frisians live on Schleswig-Holstein's western coast, and in the north-western part of Lower Saxony . [204]
Approximately 5 million Germans live abroad . [205]

Immigrant population
In 2014, about seven million of Germany's 81 million residents did not have German citizenship. Sixty-nine per cent of these people lived in western Germany and mostly in urban areas. [207] [208]
In the 1960s and 1970s, the German governments invited "guest workers" ( Gastarbeiter ) to migrate to Germany for work in the German industries. Many companies preferred to keep these workers employed in Germany after they had trained them and Germany's immigrant population has steadily increased. As of 2011 [update] , about six million foreign citizens (7.7% of the population) were registered in Germany. [196]
The Federal Statistical Office classifies the citizens by immigrant background. Regarding immigrant background, 20% of the country's residents, or more than 16 million people, were of immigrant or partially immigrant descent in 2009 (including persons descending or partially descending from ethnic German repatriates). [209] In 2010, 29% of families with children under 18 had at least one parent with immigrant roots. [210]
In 2015, the Population Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs listed Germany as host to the second-highest number of international migrants worldwide , about 5% or 12 million of all 244 million migrants. [211] Germany ranks 7th amongst EU countries and 37th globally in terms of the per centage of migrants who made up part of the country's population. As of 2014 [update] , the largest national group was from Turkey (2,859,000), followed by Poland (1,617,000), Russia (1,188,000), and Italy (764,000). [212] Since 1987, around 3 million ethnic Germans, mostly from the former Eastern Bloc countries, have exercised their right of return and emigrated to Germany. [213]

Religion
Since its foundation in 1871, Germany has been about two-thirds Protestant [e] and one-third Roman Catholic , with a notable Jewish minority. Other faiths existed in the state, but never achieved a demographic significance and cultural impact of these three confessions. Germany almost lost its Jewish minority during the Holocaust . [f] Religious makeup changed gradually in the decades following 1945, with West Germany becoming more religiously diversified through immigration and East Germany becoming overwhelmingly irreligious through state policies . It continues to diversify after the German reunification in 1990, with an accompanying substantial decline in religiosity throughout all of Germany and a contrasting increase of Evangelical Protestants and Muslims . [214]
Geographically, Protestantism is concentrated in the northern, central and eastern parts of the country. [g] These are mostly members of the EKD, which encompasses Lutheran , Reformed and administrative or confessional unions of both traditions dating back to the Prussian Union of 1817. [h] Roman Catholicism is concentrated in the south and west.
According to the 2011 German Census , Christianity is the largest religion in Germany, claiming 66.8% of the total population. [215] Relative to the whole population, 31.7% declared themselves as Protestants , including members of the Evangelical Church in Germany (EKD) (30.8%) and the free churches ( German : Evangelische Freikirchen ) (0.9%), and 31.2% declared themselves as Roman Catholics . [216] Orthodox believers constituted 1.3%, while Jews –0.1%. Other religions accounted for 2.7%. In 2014, the Catholic Church accounted for 23.9 million members (29.5% of the population) [217] and the Evangelical Church for 22.6 million (27.9% of the population). [218] Both large churches have lost significant numbers of adherents in recent years.
In 2011, 33% of Germans were not members of officially recognised religious associations with special status. [216] [i] Irreligion in Germany is strongest in the former East Germany, which used to be predominantly Protestant before state atheism , and major metropolitan areas. [220] [221] [222]
Islam is the second largest religion in the country. In the 2011 census 1.9% of Germans (1.52 million people) declared themselves to be Muslims, [216] albeit the number was believed to be higher. [223] Other estimates suggested a number of 4 million in 2010 and between 3.2 and 3.5 million in earlier years. [224] A study conducted by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees concluded there were about 4.5 million Muslims (5.5% of the population) living in Germany in 2015. Between 2011 and 2015 the Muslim population rose by 1.2 million people, mostly due to immigration. [225] Most of the Muslims are Sunnis and Alevites from Turkey, but there are a small number of Shi'ites , Ahmadiyyas and other denominations. [226]
Other religions comprising less than one per cent of Germany's population [216] are Buddhism with 250,000 adherents (roughly 0.3%) and Hinduism with some 100,000 adherents (0.1%). All other religious communities in Germany have fewer than 50,000 adherents each. [227]

Languages
German is the official and predominant spoken language in Germany. [228] Standard German is a West Germanic language and is closely related to and classified alongside Low German , Dutch , Afrikaans , Frisian and English . To a lesser extent, it is also related to the North Germanic languages. Most German vocabulary is derived from the Germanic branch of the Indo-European language family. [229] Significant minorities of words are derived from Latin and Greek, with a smaller amount from French and most recently English (known as Denglisch ). German is written using the Latin alphabet. German dialects , traditional local varieties traced back to the Germanic tribes, are distinguished from varieties of standard German by their lexicon , phonology , and syntax . [230] It is one of 24 official and working languages of the European Union, [231] and one of the three working languages of the European Commission . German is the most widely spoken first language in the European Union , with around 100 million native speakers. [232]
Recognised native minority languages in Germany are Danish , Low German , Sorbian , Romany , and Frisian ; they are officially protected by the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages . The most used immigrant languages are Turkish , Kurdish , Polish , the Balkan languages , and Russian . Germans are typically multilingual: 67% of German citizens claim to be able to communicate in at least one foreign language and 27% in at least two. [228]

Education
Responsibility for educational supervision in Germany is primarily organised within the individual federal states . Optional kindergarten education is provided for all children between three and six years old, after which school attendance is compulsory for at least nine years. Primary education usually lasts for four to six years. [233] Secondary education includes three traditional types of schools focused on different academic levels: the Gymnasium enrols the most gifted children and prepares students for university studies; the Realschule for intermediate students lasts six years and the Hauptschule prepares pupils for vocational education. [234] The Gesamtschule unifies all secondary education.
A system of apprenticeship called Duale Ausbildung leads to a skilled qualification which is almost comparable to an academic degree. It allows students in vocational training to learn in a company as well as in a state-run trade school. [233] This model is well regarded and reproduced all around the world. [235]
Most of the German universities are public institutions, and students traditionally study without fee payment. [236] The general requirement for university is the Abitur . However, there are a number of exceptions, depending on the state, the college and the subject. Tuition free academic education is open to international students and is increasingly common. [237] According to an OECD report in 2014, Germany is the world's third leading destination for international study. [238]
Germany has a long tradition of higher education reflecting the global status as a modern economy. The established universities in Germany include some of the oldest in the world , with Heidelberg University (established in 1386) being the oldest. [239] It is followed by the Leipzig University (1409), the Rostock University (1419) and the Greifswald University (1456). [240] The University of Berlin , founded in 1810 by the liberal educational reformer Wilhelm von Humboldt , became the academic model for many European and Western universities. In the contemporary era Germany has developed eleven Universities of Excellence : Humboldt University Berlin , the University of Bremen , the University of Cologne , TU Dresden , the University of Tübingen , RWTH Aachen , FU Berlin , Heidelberg University , the University of Konstanz , LMU Munich , and the Technical University of Munich . [241]

Health
Germany's system of hospices, called spitals , dates from medieval times, and today, Germany has the world's oldest universal health care system, dating from Bismarck's social legislation of the 1880s, [243] Since the 1880s, reforms and provisions have ensured a balanced health care system. Currently the population is covered by a health insurance plan provided by statute, with criteria allowing some groups to opt for a private health insurance contract. According to the World Health Organization , Germany's health care system was 77% government-funded and 23% privately funded as of 2013 [update] . [244] In 2014, Germany spent 11.3% of its GDP on health care. [245] Germany ranked 20th in the world in life expectancy with 77 years for men and 82 years for women , and it had a very low infant mortality rate (4 per 1,000 live births ). [244]
In 2010 [update] , the principal cause of death was cardiovascular disease, at 41%, followed by malignant tumours, at 26%. [246] In 2008 [update] , about 82,000 Germans had been infected with HIV/AIDS and 26,000 had died from the disease (cumulatively, since 1982). [247] According to a 2005 survey, 27% of German adults are smokers. [247] Obesity in Germany has been increasingly cited as a major health issue. A 2007 study shows Germany has the highest number of overweight people in Europe. [248] [249]

Culture
Culture in German states has been shaped by major intellectual and popular currents in Europe, both religious and secular . Historically Germany has been called Das Land der Dichter und Denker ("the land of poets and thinkers"), [250] because of the major role its writers and philosophers have played in the development of Western thought. [251]
Germany is well known for such folk festival traditions as Oktoberfest and Christmas customs , which include Advent wreaths , Christmas pageants , Christmas trees , Stollen cakes , and other practices. [252] [253] As of 2016 [update] UNESCO inscribed 41 properties in Germany on the World Heritage List . [254] There are a number of public holidays in Germany determined by each state; 3 October has been a national day of Germany since 1990, celebrated as the Tag der Deutschen Einheit ( German Unity Day ). [255] Prior to reunification, the day was celebrated on 17 June, in honor of the Uprising of 1953 in East Germany which was brutally suppressed on that date in 1954. [256]
In the 21st century Berlin has emerged as a major international creative centre. [257] According to the Anholt–GfK Nation Brands Index, in 2014 Germany was the world's most respected nation among 50 countries (ahead of US, UK, and France). [258] [259] [260] A global opinion poll for the BBC revealed that Germany is recognised for having the most positive influence in the world in 2013 and 2014. [261] [262]

Music
German classical music includes works by some of the world's most well-known composers. Dieterich Buxtehude composed oratorios for organ, which influenced the later work of Johann Sebastian Bach and Georg Friedrich Händel ; these men were influential composers of the Baroque period . During his tenure as violinist and teacher at the Salzburg cathedral, Augsburg-born composer Leopold Mozart mentored one of the most noted musicians of all time: Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart . Ludwig van Beethoven was a crucial figure in the transition between the Classical and Romantic eras. Carl Maria von Weber and Felix Mendelssohn were important in the early Romantic period. Robert Schumann and Johannes Brahms composed in the Romantic idiom. Richard Wagner was known for his operas. Richard Strauss was a leading composer of the late Romantic and early modern eras. Karlheinz Stockhausen and Hans Zimmer are important composers of the 20th and early 21st centuries. [263]
Germany is the second largest music market in Europe, and fourth largest in the world. [264] German popular music of the 20th and 21st century includes the movements of Neue Deutsche Welle , pop , Ostrock , heavy metal / rock , punk , pop rock , indie and schlager pop . German electronic music gained global influence, with Kraftwerk and Tangerine Dream pioneering in this genre. [265] DJs and artists of the techno and house music scenes of Germany have become well known (e.g. Felix Jaehn , Paul van Dyk , Paul Kalkbrenner , and Scooter ). [266]

Art
German painters have influenced western art . Albrecht Dürer , Hans Holbein the Younger , Matthias Grünewald and Lucas Cranach the Elder were important German artists of the Renaissance , Peter Paul Rubens and Johann Baptist Zimmermann of the Baroque , Caspar David Friedrich and Carl Spitzweg of Romanticism , Max Liebermann of Impressionism and Max Ernst of Surrealism . [267] Such German sculptors as Otto Schmidt-Hofer , Franz Iffland , and Julius Schmidt-Felling made important contributions to German art history in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. [268] [269]
Several German art groups formed in the 20th century, such as the November Group or Die Brücke (The Bridge) and Der Blaue Reiter (The Blue Rider), by the Russian-born Wassily Kandinsky , influenced the development of Expressionism in Munich and Berlin. The New Objectivity arose as a counter-style to it during the Weimar Republic . Post-World War II art trends in Germany can broadly be divided into Neo-expressionism , performance art and Conceptualism . Especially notable neo-expressionists include Georg Baselitz , Anselm Kiefer , Jörg Immendorff , A. R. Penck , Markus Lüpertz , Peter Robert Keil and Rainer Fetting . Other notable artists who work with traditional media or figurative imagery include Martin Kippenberger , Gerhard Richter , Sigmar Polke , and Neo Rauch . Leading German conceptual artists include or included Bernd and Hilla Becher , Hanne Darboven , Hans-Peter Feldmann , Hans Haacke , Joseph Beuys , HA Schult , Aris Kalaizis , Neo Rauch ( New Leipzig School ) and Andreas Gursky (photography). Major art exhibitions and festivals in Germany are the documenta , the Berlin Biennale , transmediale and Art Cologne . [267]

Architecture
Architectural contributions from Germany include the Carolingian and Ottonian styles , which were precursors of Romanesque . Brick Gothic is a distinctive medieval style that evolved in Germany. Also in Renaissance and Baroque art, regional and typically German elements evolved (e.g. Weser Renaissance and Dresden Baroque ). Among many renowned Baroque masters were Pöppelmann , Balthasar Neumann , Knobelsdorff and the Asam brothers . The Wessobrunner School exerted a decisive influence on, and at times even dominated, the art of stucco in southern Germany in the 18th century. The Upper Swabian Baroque Route offers a baroque-themed tourist route that highlights the contributions of such artists and craftsmen as the sculptor and plasterer Johann Michael Feuchtmayer , one of the foremost members of the Feuchtmayer family and the brothers Johann Baptist Zimmermann and Dominikus Zimmermann . [270] Vernacular architecture in Germany is often identified by its timber framing ( Fachwerk ) traditions and varies across regions, and among carpentry styles. [271] [272]
When industrialisation spread across Europe, Classicism and a distinctive style of historism developed in Germany, sometimes referred to as Gründerzeit style , due to the economical boom years at the end of the 19th century. Regional historicist styles include the Hanover School , Nuremberg Style and Dresden's Semper - Nicolai School . Among the most famous of German buildings, the Schloss Neuschwanstein represents Romanesque Revival . Notable sub-styles that evolved since the 18th century are the German spa and seaside resort architecture. German artists, writers and gallerists like Siegfried Bing , Georg Hirth and Bruno Möhring also contributed to the development of Art Nouveau at the turn of the 20th century, known as Jugendstil in German. [273]
Expressionist architecture developed in the 1910s in Germany and influenced Art Deco and other modern styles, with e.g. Fritz Höger , Erich Mendelsohn , Dominikus Böhm and Fritz Schumacher being influential architects. Germany was particularly important in the early modernist movement : it is the home of Werkbund initiated by Hermann Muthesius ( New Objectivity ), and of the Bauhaus movement founded by Walter Gropius . Consequently, Germany is often considered the cradle of modern architecture and design. Ludwig Mies van der Rohe became one of the world's most renowned architects in the second half of the 20th century. He conceived of the glass façade skyscraper . [274] Renowned contemporary architects and offices include Hans Kollhoff , Sergei Tchoban , KK Architekten , Helmut Jahn , Behnisch , GMP , Ole Scheeren , J. Mayer H. , OM Ungers , Gottfried Böhm and Frei Otto (the last two being Pritzker Prize winners). [275]

Literature and philosophy
German literature can be traced back to the Middle Ages and the works of writers such as Walther von der Vogelweide and Wolfram von Eschenbach . Well-known German authors include Johann Wolfgang von Goethe , Friedrich Schiller , Gotthold Ephraim Lessing and Theodor Fontane . The collections of folk tales published by the Brothers Grimm popularised German folklore on an international level. [276] The Grimms also gathered and codified regional variants of the German language, grounding their work in historical principles; their Deutsches Wörterbuch , or German Dictionary, sometimes called the Grimm dictionary, was begun in 1838 and the first volumes published in 1854. [277]
Influential authors of the 20th century include Gerhart Hauptmann , Thomas Mann , Hermann Hesse , Heinrich Böll and Günter Grass . [278] The German book market is the third largest in the world, after the United States and China. [279] The Frankfurt Book Fair is the most important in the world for international deals and trading, with a tradition spanning over 500 years. [280] The Leipzig Book Fair also retains a major position in Europe. [281]
German philosophy is historically significant: Gottfried Leibniz 's contributions to rationalism ; the enlightenment philosophy by Immanuel Kant ; the establishment of classical German idealism by Johann Gottlieb Fichte , Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling ; Arthur Schopenhauer 's composition of metaphysical pessimism; the formulation of communist theory by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels ; Friedrich Nietzsche 's development of perspectivism ; Gottlob Frege 's contributions to the dawn of analytic philosophy ; Martin Heidegger 's works on Being; the development of the Frankfurt school by Max Horkheimer , Theodor Adorno , Herbert Marcuse and Jürgen Habermas have been particularly influential.

Media
The largest internationally operating media companies in Germany are the Bertelsmann enterprise, Axel Springer SE and ProSiebenSat.1 Media . The German Press Agency DPA is also significant. Germany's television market is the largest in Europe, with some 38 million TV households. [282] Around 90% of German households have cable or satellite TV, with a variety of free-to-view public and commercial channels. [283] There are more than 500 public and private radio stations in Germany , with the public Deutsche Welle being the main German radio and television broadcaster in foreign languages. [284] Germany's national radio network is the Deutschlandradio while ARD stations are covering local services.
Many of Europe's best-selling newspapers and magazines are produced in Germany. The papers (and internet portals) with the highest circulation are Bild (a tabloid ), Die Zeit , Süddeutsche Zeitung , Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung and Die Welt , the largest magazines include Der Spiegel , Stern and Focus . [285]
The German video gaming market is one of the largest in the world. [286] The Gamescom in Cologne is the world's leading gaming convention. [287] Popular game series from Germany include Turrican , the Anno series , The Settlers series , the Gothic series , SpellForce , the FIFA Manager series , Far Cry and Crysis . Relevant game developers and publishers are Blue Byte , Crytek , Deep Silver , Kalypso Media , Piranha Bytes , Yager Development , and some of the largest social network game companies like Bigpoint , Gameforge , Goodgame and Wooga . [288]

Cinema
German cinema has made major technical and artistic contributions to film. The first works of the Skladanowsky Brothers were shown to an audience in 1895. The renowned Babelsberg Studio in Berlin's suburb Potsdam was established in 1912, thus being the first large-scale film studio in the world. Today it is Europe's largest studio. [289] Other early and still active studios include UFA and Bavaria Film . Early German cinema was particularly influential with German expressionists such as Robert Wiene and Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau . Director Fritz Lang 's Metropolis (1927) is referred to as the first major science-fiction film. [290] In 1930 Josef von Sternberg directed The Blue Angel , the first major German sound film , with Marlene Dietrich . [291] Films of Leni Riefenstahl set new artistic standards, in particular Triumph of the Will . [292]
After 1945, many of the films of the immediate post-war period can be characterised as Trümmerfilm (rubble film). Such films included Wolfgang Staudte 's Die Mörder sind unter uns (The Murderers are among us, 1946) and Irgendwo in Berlin (Somewhere in Berlin, 1946) by Werner Krien . Notable East German films were largely produced by DEFA and included Ehe im Schatten (Marriage in the Shadows) by Kurt Maetzig (1947), Der Untertan (1951); Die Geschichte vom kleinen Muck (The Story of Little Muck, 1953), Konrad Wolf 's Der geteilte Himmel (Divided Heaven) (1964) and Frank Beyer 's Jacob the Liar (1975). The defining film genre in West Germany of the 1950s was arguably the Heimatfilm ("homeland film"); these films depicted the beauty of the land and the moral integrity of the people living in it. [293] Characteristic for the films of the 1960s were genre films including Edgar Wallace and Karl May adaptations. One of the most successful German movie series of the 1970s included the sex reports called Schulmädchen-Report (Schoolgirl Report). During the 1970s and 1980s, New German Cinema directors such as Volker Schlöndorff , Werner Herzog , Wim Wenders , and Rainer Werner Fassbinder brought West German auteur cinema to critical acclaim.
Among the box office hits, there were films such as Chariots of the Gods (1970), Das Boot (The Boat, 1981), The Never Ending Story (1984), Otto – The Movie (1985), Run Lola Run (1998), Manitou's Shoe (2001), the Resident Evil series (2002–2016), Good Bye, Lenin! (2003), Head On (2004), The White Ribbon (2009), Animals United (2010), and Cloud Atlas (2012). The Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film ("Oscar") went to the German production Die Blechtrommel (The Tin Drum) in 1979, to Nirgendwo in Afrika (Nowhere in Africa) in 2002, and to Das Leben der Anderen (The Lives of Others) in 2007. Various Germans won an "Oscar" award for their performances in other films. [294]
The annual European Film Awards ceremony is held every other year in Berlin, home of the European Film Academy . The Berlin International Film Festival , known as "Berlinale", awarding the " Golden Bear " and held annually since 1951, is one of the world's leading film festivals . [295] The "Lolas" are annually awarded in Berlin, at the German Film Awards , that have been presented since 1951. [296]

Cuisine
German cuisine varies from region to region and often neighbouring regions share some culinary similarities (e.g. the southern regions of Bavaria and Swabia share some traditions with Switzerland and Austria). International varieties such as pizza , sushi , Chinese food , Greek food , Indian cuisine and doner kebab are also popular and available, thanks to diverse ethnic communities.
Bread is a significant part of German cuisine and German bakeries produce about 600 main types of bread and 1,200 different types of pastries and rolls ( Brötchen ). German cheeses account for about a third of all cheese produced in Europe. [297] In 2012 over 99% of all meat produced in Germany was either pork, chicken or beef. Germans produce their ubiquitous sausages in almost 1,500 varieties, including Bratwursts , Weisswursts , and Currywursts . [298] In 2012, organic foods accounted for 3.9% of total food sales. [299]
Although wine is becoming more popular in many parts of Germany, especially close to German wine regions , [300] the national alcoholic drink is beer . German beer consumption per person stands at 110 litres (24 imp gal; 29 US gal) in 2013 and remains among the highest in the world . [301] German beer purity regulations date back to the 15th century. [302]
The 2015 Michelin Guide awarded eleven restaurants in Germany three stars , the highest designation, while 38 more received two stars and 233 one star. [303] German restaurants have become the world's second-most decorated after France. [304] [305]

Sports
Twenty-seven million Germans are members of a sports club and an additional twelve million pursue sports individually. [306] Association football is the most popular sport. With more than 6.3 million official members, the German Football Association ( Deutscher Fußball-Bund ) is the largest sports organisation of its kind worldwide, and the German top league, the Bundesliga , attracts the second highest average attendance of all professional sports leagues in the world. [306] The German men's national football team won the FIFA World Cup in 1954, 1974, 1990, and 2014, and the UEFA European Championship in 1972, 1980 and 1996. Germany hosted the FIFA World Cup in 1974 and 2006 and the UEFA European Championship in 1988 .
Other popular spectator sports include winter sports , boxing , basketball , handball , volleyball , ice hockey , tennis , horse riding and golf . Water sports like sailing , rowing , and swimming are popular in Germany as well. [306]
Germany is one of the leading motor sports countries in the world. Constructors like BMW and Mercedes are prominent manufacturers in motor sport. Porsche has won the 24 Hours of Le Mans race 17 times, and Audi 13 times (as of 2015 [update] ). The driver Michael Schumacher has set many motor sport records during his career, having won seven Formula One World Drivers' Championships , more than any other. He is one of the highest paid sportsmen in history. [307] Sebastian Vettel is also among the top five most successful Formula One drivers of all time. [308] Also Nico Rosberg won the Formula One World Championship.
Historically, German athletes have been successful contenders in the Olympic Games , ranking third in an all-time Olympic Games medal count (when combining East and West German medals). Germany was the last country to host both the summer and winter games in the same year, in 1936 the Berlin Summer Games and the Winter Games in Garmisch-Partenkirchen . [309] In Munich it hosted the Summer Games of 1972 . [310]

Fashion and design
German designers became early leaders of modern product design , with the Bauhaus designers like Mies van der Rohe , and Dieter Rams of Braun being essential pioneers. [311]
Germany is a leading country in the fashion industry . The German textile industry consisted of about 1,300 companies with more than 130,000 employees in 2010, which generated a revenue of 28 billion Euro. Almost 44 per cent of the products are exported. [312] The Berlin Fashion Week and the fashion trade fair Bread & Butter are held twice a year. [313]
Munich, Hamburg, Cologne and Düsseldorf are also important design, production and trade hubs of the domestic fashion industry, among smaller towns. [314] Renowned fashion designers from Germany include Karl Lagerfeld , Jil Sander , Wolfgang Joop , Philipp Plein adn Michael Michalsky . Important brands include Hugo Boss , Escada , Adidas , Puma , Esprit and Triumph . The German supermodels Claudia Schiffer , Heidi Klum , Tatjana Patitz , Nadja Auermann and Toni Garrn , among others , have come to international fame. [315]

Elitism
Elitism is the belief or attitude that individuals who form an elite —a select group of people with a certain ancestry , intrinsic quality , high intellect , wealth , specialized training, experience, distinctive attributes, whose influence or authority is greater than that of others, whose views on a matter are to be taken more seriously, whose views or actions are more likely to be constructive to society as a whole, or whose extraordinary skills, abilities, or wisdom render them especially fit to govern. In America, the term "elitism" often refers to the concentration of power on the Northeast Corridor and West Coast, where the typical American elite - lawyers, doctors, high-level civil servants (such as White House aides), businesspeople, university lecturers, entrepreneurs and financial advisors in the quarternary sector - reside, often in the university towns they graduated from. [1]
Alternatively, the term elitism may be used to describe a situation in which power is concentrated in the hands of a limited number of people. Oppositions of elitism include anti-elitism , egalitarianism , populism and political theory of pluralism . Elite theory is the sociological or political science analysis of elite influence in society: elite theorists regard pluralism as a utopian ideal.
'Elitism' also refers to situations in which an individual assumes special 'privileges' and responsibilities in the hope that this arrangement will benefit humanity or themselves. Elitism is closely related to social class and what sociologists call social stratification . Members of the upper classes are sometimes known as the social elite. The term elitism is also sometimes used to denote situations in which a group of people claiming to possess high abilities or simply an in-group or cadre grant themselves extra privileges at the expense of others. This form of elitism may be described as discrimination .

Characteristics
Attributes that identify an elite vary; personal achievement may not be essential. Elitist status can be based on personal achievement, such as degrees from top-rate universities or impressive internships and job offers, it can (in archaic societies) be based on lineage or passed-on fame from parents or grandparents. As a term "Elite" usually describes a person or group of people who are members of the uppermost class of society, and wealth can contribute to that class determination. Personal attributes commonly purported by elitist theorists to be characteristic of the elite include: rigorous study of, or great accomplishment within, a particular field; a long track record of competence in a demanding field; an extensive history of dedication and effort in service to a specific discipline (e.g., medicine or law) or a high degree of accomplishment, training or wisdom within a given field. Elitists tend to favor social systems such as meritocracy , technocracy and plutocracy as opposed to radical democracy , political egalitarianism and populism . Elitists also believe only a few "shakers and movers" truly change society rather than society being changed by the majority of people who only vote and elect the elites into power. To elitists, the public is abjectly powerless and can be manipulated only by the top group of elites. [2]
Some synonyms for "elite" might be "upper-class" or " aristocratic ", indicating that the individual in question has a relatively large degree of control over a society's means of production . This includes those who gain this position due to socioeconomic means and not personal achievement. However, these terms are misleading when discussing elitism as a political theory, because they are often associated with negative "class" connotations and fail to appreciate a more unbiased exploration of the philosophy.

Academic elitism
Elitism in the context of education is the practice of concentrating attention on or allocating funding to the best students, or those students who rank highest in a particular field of endeavour. For example, a politician who promotes advanced classes for students deemed to be highly intelligent might be accused of elitism, even if this were argued to promote an egalitarian goal, such as curing disease. Elitism in education could be based on conventional assessment of learning ability, knowledge, or other abilities. However, an "elite" school can also mean a school for the wealthy or hard to enter.

Anti-elitism
The term elitism and the pejorative title elitist are sometimes used by people who aren't (or, who claim not to be) members of elite organizations. In politics, such terms are often used to disparage a politician's views as out of touch with the interests of the " average Joe ". The implication is that the alleged elitist person or group thinks they are better than everyone else, and put themselves before others as a result. Its definition is therefore similar to that of the word " snob ". An elitist is not always seen as truly elite, but only privileged. The definition may have different appreciations depending on the political contexts. Since elitism may be viewed as something necessary for creating patterns of good intellectual or professional performance, it can be used also for maintaining conditions of lack of competition and privilege. Notably, elitism may often be confused or mistakenly conflated with meritocracy , either intentionally as an aspect of political rhetoric , or due to a popular misunderstanding of meritocratic systems as elitist.

Egalitarianism
Elitism endorses the exclusion of large numbers of people from positions of privilege or power. Thus, many populists seek the (perceived, if not present in practice) social equality of egalitarianism, populism , socialism , or communism . They may also support affirmative action , social security , luxury taxes , and highly progressive taxes for the wealthiest members of society. All of these measures seek to reduce the difference of power between the elite and the ordinary. However, these measures to reduce difference could be seen as anti- meritocratic in that they avoid rewarding or promoting those who are the most competitive or provide the most effort in their endeavors.
The terms elitism and meritocracy are not equivalent in meaning. Professor Kenneth Paul Tan at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy asserts that "Meritocracy, in trying to 'isolate' merit by treating people with fundamentally unequal backgrounds as superficially the same, can be a practice that ignores and even conceals the real advantages and disadvantages that are unevenly distributed to different segments of an inherently unequal society, a practice that in fact perpetuates this fundamental inequality. In this way, those who are picked by meritocracy as having merit may already have enjoyed unfair advantages from the very beginning, ignored according to the principle of nondiscrimination." [3]

Henry Blodget
Henry Blodget (born 1966) is an American businessman, investor, journalist, and author.
He is a former equity research analyst who was senior Internet analyst for CIBC Oppenheimer and the head of the global Internet research team at Merrill Lynch during the dot-com era . [1] Due to his violations of securities laws and subsequent civil trial conviction, Blodget is permanently banned from involvement in the securities industry. [2] Blodget is now the editor and CEO of Business Insider , a business news aggregator site, as well as a host of Yahoo Daily Ticker, a finance show on Yahoo.

Early life
Blodget was born and raised on Manhattan's Upper East Side , the son of a commercial banker. He attended Phillips Exeter Academy and received a Bachelor of Arts degree in History from Yale University , where he was a member of The Society of Orpheus and Bacchus . After college, he taught English in Japan , then moved to San Francisco to try to be a writer while supporting himself by giving tennis lessons. He was also a freelance journalist and a proofreader for Harper's Magazine . [1]
In 1994, Blodget joined the corporate finance training program at Prudential Securities , and, two years later, moved to Oppenheimer & Co. in equity research. In October 1998 he predicted that Amazon, then trading at $240, would trade for $400 within a year. This was thought highly unlikely by many traders at the time; however, just three weeks later Amazon's stock passed that mark (a gain of 128%). [3]
This call received significant media attention. Two months later, he accepted a position at Merrill Lynch, [3] [4] and frequently appeared on CNBC and other similar shows. In early 2000, days before the dot-com bubble burst, Blodget personally invested $700,000 in tech stocks, only to lose most of it in the years that followed. [5] In 2001, he accepted a buyout offer from Merrill Lynch and left the firm. [1]

Fraud allegation and settlement
In 2002, then New York State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer published Merrill Lynch e-mails in which Blodget gave assessments about stocks which conflicted with what was publicly published. [6] In 2003, he was charged with civil securities fraud by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission . [7] He agreed to a permanent ban from the securities industry and paid a $2 million fine plus a $2 million disgorgement . [2]

Writing
He became the CEO, Co-Founder, and Editor in Chief of Silicon Alley Insider, where he was a frequent contributor to the Seeking Alpha website. [8] Prior to co-founding Silicon Alley Insider, Mr. Blodget served as CEO of Cherry Hill Research, a research and consulting firm, and contributed to Slate, Newsweek International, The New York Times, Fortune, Forbes Online, Business 2.0, Euromoney, New York, Financial Times, and other publications. As of 2012, he is the CEO/editor-in-chief of Business Insider , a news aggregator website. He is a frequent contributor to the magazines Slate , Newsweek , and New York .
Blodget's later articles for the magazine have focused on the return-limiting actions of individual investors, including listening to analysts and the financial media, and relying on active management such as mutual and hedge funds. His Slate articles about investing carry a seven-paragraph disclosure of potential conflicts of interest. [5]
He published The Wall Street Self-Defense Manual: A Consumer's Guide to Intelligent Investing in January 2007.
He currently lives in Brooklyn .

Internet broadcaster
Blodget used to co-host the The Daily-Ticker [9] broadcast with Aaron Task weekdays at Yahoo! Finance .

List of Wikipedias
This is a list of the different language editions of Wikipedia ; as of 26 May 2017 there are 296 Wikipedias of which 285 are active.

Wikipedia edition codes
Each Wikipedia has a code, which is used as a subdomain below wikipedia.org. Interlanguage links are sorted by that code. The codes represent the language codes defined by ISO 639-1 and ISO 639-3 , and the decision of which language code to use is usually determined by the IETF language tag policy. Wikipedias also vary by how thinly they slice dialects and variants; for example, the English Wikipedia includes most modern varieties of English (American English, Indian English, South African English, etc.), but does not include other related languages such as Scots , or Anglo-Saxon , all of which have separate Wikipedias. The Spanish Wikipedia includes both Peninsular Castilian and Latin American Spanish ; Malay Wikipedia includes a large number of Malay languages; and so on.
Differences between the ISO mappings and Wikipedia codes include:
Additionally, Wikipedias vary in wikt:orthography at times. Chinese Wikipedia automatically translates from modern Mandarin Chinese into four standard forms: Mainland China and Singapore in simplified Chinese characters, and Taiwan and Hong Kong / Macau in traditional Chinese characters. Belarussian , however, has a separate Wikipedia for the 'normative' orthography (be) and Taraškievica (be-tarask).

List
An approximation to the number of active users is given in powers of ten (see common logarithm ): so "5" means at least 10,000, "4" means at least 1000, "3" means at least 100, and so on.

Russian Wikipedia
The Russian Wikipedia ( Russian : Ру́сская Википе́дия ) is the Russian-language edition of Wikipedia. As of May, 2017, it has 1,395,398 articles . It was started on 11 May 2001. [1] In October 2015 it became the sixth-largest Wikipedia by the number of articles. It has the fifth-largest number of edits (97.9 million).
It is the largest Wikipedia written in any Slavic language , surpassing its nearest rival, the Polish Wikipedia , eightfold by the parameter of depth . [2] In addition, the Russian Wikipedia is the largest Wikipedia written in Cyrillic [3] or in a script other than Latin script . In April 2016, the project had 3,377 active editors who made at least five edits in that month, ranking third behind the English and Spanish versions.

Policies
Difficult issues are resolved through the Arbitration Committee , which handles content disputes, blocks users or prohibits certain users from editing articles on certain topics. [4]
Administrators (currently 84) are elected through a vote; a minimal quorum of 30 voters and 66% of support votes are required if the request is to be considered successful. Administrators who have become inactive (i.e. have not used administrative tools, such as "delete" or "block" buttons, at least 25 times in six months) may lose their privileges by an Arbitration Committee decision. [5]

History
The Russian Wikipedia was created on 20 May 2001 in the first wave of non-English Wikipedias, along with editions in Catalan , Chinese , Dutch , German , Esperanto , French , Hebrew , Italian , Japanese , Portuguese , Spanish , and Swedish .
The first edit of the Russian Wikipedia was on 24 May 2001, and consisted of the line "Россия – великая страна" (" Russia is a great nation "). The following edit changed it to the joke: "Россия — родина слонов (ушастых, повышенной проходимости — см. мамонт)" (" Russia is the motherland of elephants (big-eared, improved cross-country capability, see Mammoth . ") [7]
For a long time development was slow (especially after some participants left for WikiZnanie ), but in the 12-month period between February 2005 and February 2006 it surpassed nine editions in other languages – the Catalan, Bulgarian, Ukrainian, Hebrew, Finnish, Norwegian, Chinese, Esperanto and Danish Wikipedias. In 2006, 2007, 2009 and 2010 [8] the Russian Wikipedia won the "Science and education" category of the " Runet Prize " ( Russian : Премия Рунета ) award, supervised by the Russian government agency FAPMC . [9]

Content
As of 1 June 2012, some of the biggest categories (which contain more than 5,000 articles) in the Russian Wikipedia are: [10]
10,340 articles contain material from the Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary .
More than 11,000 articles were translated from the English Wikipedia .

Namespaces
In addition to common [ which? ] Wikipedia namespaces , the Russian Wikipedia has three custom ones – "Incubator" (# 102–103) – which is used as a training camp for new users and their first articles, "Project" (# 104–105) – for Wikipedia projects and "Arbitration" (# 106–107) – for arbitration requests.

Criticism
In 2015, Roman Leibov , a professor at University of Tartu , in an interview opined that articles related to humanities in Russian Wikipedia are of considerably inferior quality compared to English Wikipedia, and some articles even deteriorate with time. He suggested that this effect is due to overzealous policing of intellectual property rights by the community and bemoaned poor editing skills of some Wikipedians. [11]

Timeline

Blackout
On 10 July 2012 Russian Wikipedia closed access to its contents for 24 hours in protest against proposed amendments to Russia's Information Act ( Bill No. 89417-6 ) regulating the accessibility of Internet-based information to children. Among other things, the bill stipulates the creation and country-wide enforcement of blacklists , which would block access to forbidden sites on the territory of Russia. Several aspects of this amendment drew criticism from various civil rights activists and Internet providers. In particular, the blacklist inclusion criteria were characterized as "too vague" and "paving the way for Internet censorship ". [15]
Supporters of the amendment stated that it is aimed only at widely prohibited content such as child pornography and similar information, but the Russian Wikimedia chapter has declared that conditions for determining the content falling under this law will create a thing like the "great Chinese firewall". They further claimed that existing Russian legal practice demonstrates a high likelihood of a worst-case scenario, resulting in a country-wide ban of Wikipedia. [16] [17] The second and the third readings of the law were held in the State Duma on 11 July; no essential corrections were introduced. The law will come into force after three readings in the State Duma, one reading in the Federation Council and presidential approval. [18]
On 10 July, Nikolai Nikiforov , Russian Minister for Telecommunications and Mass Media announced in his Twitter account, that the organization of the List of the prohibited websites (that was sited on the Law Project No. 89417-6 ) will be suspended until 1 November 2012. [18] [19] On the same day Yelena Mizulina , a Duma deputy and the head of the subcommittee which sponsored the law, said that the blackout is an attempt to blackmail the Duma and was sponsored by the "pedophile lobby". [20]

Russian Wikipedia blacklisted
On 5 April 2013, it was confirmed by a spokesperson for the Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media that Wikipedia had been blacklisted over the article ' Cannabis Smoking ' on Russian Wikipedia. [21] [22] On 31 March 2013 the New York Times reported that Russia was beginning 'Selectively Blocking [the] Internet', [23] though Wikipedia itself was not blocked at that time.
The entire Russian Wikipedia was blocked in the Russian Federation for a few hours in August 2015 due to the contents of the article on charas . [24]

Japanese Wikipedia
The Japanese Wikipedia ( ウィキペディア日本語版 ? , Wikipedia Nihongo-ban , literally " Wikipedia: Japanese-language version ") is the Japanese-language edition of Wikipedia , a free, open-content encyclopedia. Started on 11 May 2001, [1] the edition attained the 200,000 article mark in April 2006 and the 500,000 article mark in June 2008. As of May 2017, it has over 1,062,000 articles. [2] In April 2016, the project had 4,192 active editors who made at least five edits in that month, ranking fourth behind the English, Spanish and Russian editions.

History
In March 2001, three non-English editions of Wikipedia were created, namely, the German , the Catalan , and the Japanese Wikipedias. [3] The original site address of the Japanese Wikipedia was http://nihongo.wikipedia.com and all pages were written in the Latin alphabet or romaji , as the software did not work with Japanese characters at the time. The home page also showed an early attempt at creating a vertical text. [4]
The first article was named "Nihongo no Funimekusu". Until late December in that year, there were only two articles.

Expansion
On January 31, 2003, a Japanese online magazine, Wired News Japanese edition, covered Wikipedia. After that, the number of participants started to increase considerably and many pages about the Wikipedia project were translated or created.
On February 12, 2003, the Japanese edition of Wikipedia reached the 1,000-page milestone, two years after the English edition. Given that accomplishment, Slashdot Japan posted a story about the Japanese Wikipedia. Several days after that, the number of participants doubled, attesting to the power of the Slashdot effect . Because of this exposure, a variety of articles started to appear, among them physics , biology , information technology , literature , music , games , manga , and celebrities .
On July 15, 2003 the Japanese Wikipedia reached 10,000 articles, four months and three days after the 1,000-article milestone, beating the time it took the English Wikipedia to achieve the same feat. By early 2004 the Japanese Wikipedia contained 30,000 articles. The increase in both articles and contributors was steady after that, and by late September it had reached 75,000 articles.
The major force behind the expansion appeared to be a number of links at Yahoo! Japan News. It is unknown exactly when Yahoo! started to put links to the edition in their articles, but as of August 2004 [update] , dozens of news articles posted on Yahoo! Japan contained links to the edition to explain terms in the articles. Lately, [ when? ] the developers of Wikipedia have noticed that certain spikes in server usage correspond to the publishing of Yahoo! Japan news articles containing links to Wikipedia.

Awards
In September 2004, the Japanese Wikipedia was awarded the "2004 Web Creation Award Web-Person Special Prize" [5] from the Japan Advertisers Association. [6] This award, normally given to individuals for great contributions to the Web in Japanese, was accepted by a long-standing contributor on behalf of the project.

Characteristics
The Japanese Wikipedia is different from this English Wikipedia in a number of ways.

Culture
Andrew Lih has written that influence from 2channel (2ch) resulted in many Japanese Wikipedia editors being unregistered and anonymous. [18] Because of the lack of registered users, Japanese Wikipedia editors as a whole interact less with the international Wikipedia community and the Wikimedia Foundation than editors of other Wikipedias do. Lih also wrote that Japanese Wikipedia users are less likely to engage in edit wars than users on Wikipedias of Western languages, and typically they would instead make alternative drafts of articles on their own userspaces. [19]
Jimmy Wales has pointed out at a conference that the Japanese Wikipedia is significantly more dominated by articles about pop culture than other Wikipedia projects, and according to one of his slides, as a New York Times journalist saw it, "barely 20 percent" of the articles on the Japanese Wikipedia were about anything else. [20] In relation to this, the Japanese Wikipedia is known to have a poor number of moderators as of early March 2010. [21]
Nobuo Ikeda , a known public policy academic and media critic in Japan, has suggested an ongoing 2channel-ization phenomenon on the Japanese Wikipedia. Ikeda argues that by allowing anonymous IP users, the community spawns a type of culture seen in the likes of anonymous message boards such as 2channel, [22] where hate speech , personal attacks and derogatory expressions are common, and also the source of entertainment. [23] He also remarks on the "emotional-outlet"/"get rid of stress" aspect of Japanese internet culture where 90% of blogs are anonymous, compared to the U.S. where 80% of blogs are expressed under one's own name. Ikeda's arguments are not the only sources hinting cultural correlation, influence, overlapping users from 2channel. [24] [25]
In 2006 Kizu Naoko ( 木津 尚子 ? ) , a Japanese Wikipedian, stated that on the Japanese Wikipedia most users start out as page editors and uploaders of images, and that the majority of people continue to serve in those roles. Some people apply to become administrators. Kizu said "Unfortunately, some apply for this role out of a desire for power! And then are surprised when they get rejected. (This is a kind of ‘regressive career path’—from an immature editor to a banned one!)" [26]

Persian Wikipedia
The Persian Wikipedia ( Persian : ویکی‌پدیا، دانشنامهٔ آزاد ‎‎, Romanized as Wikipediā, Dānešnāme-ye Āzād / "Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia" ) is the Persian language version of Wikipedia , pronounced "Wikipedia (Wikipediā)". The Persian version of Wikipedia was started in December 2003. It passed 1,000 articles on December 16, 2004 and 200,000 articles on July 10, 2012.

Number of articles
In January 2013, close to 50,000 new articles were added within a month. A few days later, on 19 February 2013, the Persian Wikipedia reached 300,000 articles, ranking it 18th among all Wikipedias based on number of articles. [4]
This edition of Wikipedia now contains 541,682 articles.
History of articles number:

Article depth
With article depth of 211, the Persian Wikipedia is currently ranked 7th among all Wikipedias based on article depth. [6]

Censorship
In a November 2013 report published by the Center for Global Communication Studies of the University of Pennsylvania , researchers Collin Anderson and Nima Nazeri scanned 800,000 Persian language Wikipedia articles and found that the Iranian government blocks 963 of these pages. According to the authors, "Censors repeatedly targeted Wikipedia pages about government rivals, minority religious beliefs, and criticisms of the state, officials, and the police. Just under half of the blocked Wiki-pages are biographies, including pages about individuals the authorities have allegedly detained or killed." [7] Anderson said that Persian Wikipedia, as a microcosm of the Iranian internet, is a "useful place to uncover the types of online content forbidden and an excellent template to identify keyword blocking themes and filtering rules that apply across the greater internet." [8]

World Wide Web
The World Wide Web (abbreviated WWW or the Web ) is an information space where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), interlinked by hypertext links, and can be accessed via the Internet . [1] English scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989. He wrote the first web browser computer program in 1990 while employed at CERN in Switzerland. [2] [3] The Web browser was released outside of CERN in 1991, first to other research institutions starting in January 1991 and to the general public on the Internet in August 1991.
The World Wide Web has been central to the development of the Information Age and is the primary tool billions of people use to interact on the Internet. [4] [5] [6] Web pages are primarily text documents formatted and annotated with Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). In addition to formatted text, web pages may contain images , video , audio , and software components that are rendered in the user's web browser as coherent pages of multimedia content. Embedded hyperlinks permit users to navigate between web pages. Multiple web pages with a common theme, a common domain name , or both, make up a website . Website content can largely be provided by the publisher, or interactive where users contribute content or the content depends upon the user or their actions. Websites may be mostly informative, primarily for entertainment, or largely for commercial, governmental, or non-governmental organisational purposes. In the 2006 Great British Design Quest organised by the BBC and the Design Museum , the World Wide Web was voted among the top 10 British design icons. [7]

History
Tim Berners-Lee 's vision of a global hyperlinked information system became a possibility by the second half of the 1980s. By 1985, the global Internet began to proliferate in Europe and the Domain Name System (upon which the Uniform Resource Locator is built) came into being. In 1988 the first direct IP connection between Europe and North America was made and Berners-Lee began to openly discuss the possibility of a web-like system at CERN. [8] In March 1989 Berners-Lee issued a proposal to the management at CERN for a system called "Mesh" that referenced ENQUIRE , a database and software project he had built in 1980, which used the term "web" and described a more elaborate information management system based on links embedded in readable text: "Imagine, then, the references in this document all being associated with the network address of the thing to which they referred, so that while reading this document you could skip to them with a click of the mouse." Such a system, he explained, could be referred to using one of the existing meanings of the word hypertext , a term that he says was coined in the 1950s. There is no reason, the proposal continues, why such hypertext links could not encompass multimedia documents including graphics, speech and video, so that Berners-Lee goes on to use the term hypermedia . [9]
With help from his colleague and fellow hypertext enthusiast Robert Cailliau he published a more formal proposal on 12 November 1990 to build a "Hypertext project" called "WorldWideWeb" (one word) as a "web" of "hypertext documents" to be viewed by " browsers " using a client–server architecture . [10] At this point HTML and HTTP had already been in development for about two months and the first Web server was about a month from completing its first successful test. This proposal estimated that a read-only web would be developed within three months and that it would take six months to achieve "the creation of new links and new material by readers, [so that] authorship becomes universal" as well as "the automatic notification of a reader when new material of interest to him/her has become available." While the read-only goal was met, accessible authorship of web content took longer to mature, with the wiki concept, WebDAV , blogs , Web 2.0 and RSS / Atom . [11]
The proposal was modelled after the SGML reader Dynatext by Electronic Book Technology, a spin-off from the Institute for Research in Information and Scholarship at Brown University . The Dynatext system, licensed by CERN, was a key player in the extension of SGML ISO 8879:1986 to Hypermedia within HyTime , but it was considered too expensive and had an inappropriate licensing policy for use in the general high energy physics community, namely a fee for each document and each document alteration. A NeXT Computer was used by Berners-Lee as the world's first web server and also to write the first web browser , WorldWideWeb , in 1990. By Christmas 1990, Berners-Lee had built all the tools necessary for a working Web: [12] the first web browser (which was a web editor as well) and the first web server. The first web site, [13] which described the project itself, was published on 20 December 1990. [14]
The first web page may be lost, but Paul Jones of UNC-Chapel Hill in North Carolina announced in May 2013 that Berners-Lee gave him what he says is the oldest known web page during a 1991 visit to UNC. Jones stored it on a magneto-optical drive and on his NeXT computer. [15] On 6 August 1991, Berners-Lee published a short summary of the World Wide Web project on the newsgroup alt.hypertext . [16] This date is sometimes confused with the public availability of the first web servers, which had occurred months earlier. As another example of such confusion, several news media reported that the first photo on the Web was published by Berners-Lee in 1992, an image of the CERN house band Les Horribles Cernettes taken by Silvano de Gennaro; Gennaro has disclaimed this story, writing that media were "totally distorting our words for the sake of cheap sensationalism." [17]
The first server outside Europe was installed at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) in Palo Alto, California, to host the SPIRES-HEP database. Accounts differ substantially as to the date of this event. The World Wide Web Consortium's timeline says December 1992, [18] whereas SLAC itself claims December 1991, [19] [20] as does a W3C document titled A Little History of the World Wide Web . [21] The underlying concept of hypertext originated in previous projects from the 1960s, such as the Hypertext Editing System (HES) at Brown University, Ted Nelson 's Project Xanadu , and Douglas Engelbart 's oN-Line System (NLS). Both Nelson and Engelbart were in turn inspired by Vannevar Bush 's microfilm -based memex , which was described in the 1945 essay " As We May Think ". [22]
Berners-Lee's breakthrough was to marry hypertext to the Internet. In his book Weaving The Web , he explains that he had repeatedly suggested that a marriage between the two technologies was possible to members of both technical communities, but when no one took up his invitation, he finally assumed the project himself. In the process, he developed three essential technologies:
The World Wide Web had a number of differences from other hypertext systems available at the time. The Web required only unidirectional links rather than bidirectional ones, making it possible for someone to link to another resource without action by the owner of that resource. It also significantly reduced the difficulty of implementing web servers and browsers (in comparison to earlier systems), but in turn presented the chronic problem of link rot . Unlike predecessors such as HyperCard , the World Wide Web was non-proprietary, making it possible to develop servers and clients independently and to add extensions without licensing restrictions. On 30 April 1993, CERN announced that the World Wide Web would be free to anyone, with no fees due. [24] Coming two months after the announcement that the server implementation of the Gopher protocol was no longer free to use, this produced a rapid shift away from Gopher and towards the Web. An early popular web browser was ViolaWWW for Unix and the X Windowing System .
Scholars generally agree that a turning point for the World Wide Web began with the introduction [25] of the Mosaic web browser [26] in 1993, a graphical browser developed by a team at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (NCSA-UIUC), led by Marc Andreessen . Funding for Mosaic came from the U.S. High-Performance Computing and Communications Initiative and the High Performance Computing and Communication Act of 1991 , one of several computing developments initiated by U.S. Senator Al Gore . [27] Prior to the release of Mosaic, graphics were not commonly mixed with text in web pages and the web's popularity was less than older protocols in use over the Internet, such as Gopher and Wide Area Information Servers (WAIS). Mosaic's graphical user interface allowed the Web to become, by far, the most popular Internet protocol. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was founded by Tim Berners-Lee after he left the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in October 1994. It was founded at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Laboratory for Computer Science (MIT/LCS) with support from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which had pioneered the Internet; a year later, a second site was founded at INRIA (a French national computer research lab) with support from the European Commission DG InfSo; and in 1996, a third continental site was created in Japan at Keio University . By the end of 1994, the total number of websites was still relatively small, but many notable websites were already active that foreshadowed or inspired today's most popular services.
Connected by the Internet, other websites were created around the world. This motivated international standards development for protocols and formatting. Berners-Lee continued to stay involved in guiding the development of web standards, such as the markup languages to compose web pages and he advocated his vision of a Semantic Web . The World Wide Web enabled the spread of information over the Internet through an easy-to-use and flexible format. It thus played an important role in popularising use of the Internet. [28] Although the two terms are sometimes conflated in popular use, World Wide Web is not synonymous with Internet . [29] The Web is an information space containing hyperlinked documents and other resources , identified by their URIs. [30] It is implemented as both client and server software using Internet protocols such as TCP/IP and HTTP . Berners-Lee was knighted in 2004 by Queen Elizabeth II for "services to the global development of the Internet". [31] [32]

Function
The terms Internet and World Wide Web are often used without much distinction. However, the two are not the same. The Internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks . In contrast, the World Wide Web is a global collection of documents and other resources , linked by hyperlinks and URIs . Web resources are usually accessed using HTTP , which is one of many Internet communication protocols. [33]
Viewing a web page on the World Wide Web normally begins either by typing the URL of the page into a web browser, or by following a hyperlink to that page or resource. The web browser then initiates a series of background communication messages to fetch and display the requested page. In the 1990s, using a browser to view web pages—and to move from one web page to another through hyperlinks—came to be known as 'browsing,' 'web surfing' (after channel surfing ), or 'navigating the Web'. Early studies of this new behaviour investigated user patterns in using web browsers. One study, for example, found five user patterns: exploratory surfing, window surfing, evolved surfing, bounded navigation and targeted navigation. [34]
The following example demonstrates the functioning of a web browser when accessing a page at the URL http://www.example.org/home.html . The browser resolves the server name of the URL ( www.example.org ) into an Internet Protocol address using the globally distributed Domain Name System (DNS). This lookup returns an IP address such as 203.0.113.4 or 2001:db8:2e::7334 . The browser then requests the resource by sending an HTTP request across the Internet to the computer at that address. It requests service from a specific TCP port number that is well known for the HTTP service, so that the receiving host can distinguish an HTTP request from other network protocols it may be servicing. The HTTP protocol normally uses port number 80 . The content of the HTTP request can be as simple as two lines of text:
The computer receiving the HTTP request delivers it to web server software listening for requests on port 80. If the web server can fulfil the request it sends an HTTP response back to the browser indicating success:
followed by the content of the requested page. HyperText Markup Language ( HTML ) for a basic web page might look like this:
The web browser parses the HTML and interprets the markup ( < title > , < p > for paragraph, and such) that surrounds the words to format the text on the screen. Many web pages use HTML to reference the URLs of other resources such as images, other embedded media, scripts that affect page behaviour, and Cascading Style Sheets that affect page layout. The browser makes additional HTTP requests to the web server for these other Internet media types . As it receives their content from the web server, the browser progressively renders the page onto the screen as specified by its HTML and these additional resources.

Linking
Most web pages contain hyperlinks to other related pages and perhaps to downloadable files, source documents, definitions and other web resources. In the underlying HTML, a hyperlink looks like this: < a href = "http://www.example.org/home.html" > Example.org Homepage </ a >
Such a collection of useful, related resources, interconnected via hypertext links is dubbed a web of information. Publication on the Internet created what Tim Berners-Lee first called the WorldWideWeb (in its original CamelCase , which was subsequently discarded) in November 1990. [10]
The hyperlink structure of the WWW is described by the webgraph : the nodes of the webgraph correspond to the web pages (or URLs) the directed edges between them to the hyperlinks. Over time, many web resources pointed to by hyperlinks disappear, relocate, or are replaced with different content. This makes hyperlinks obsolete, a phenomenon referred to in some circles as link rot, and the hyperlinks affected by it are often called dead links . The ephemeral nature of the Web has prompted many efforts to archive web sites. The Internet Archive , active since 1996, is the best known of such efforts.

Dynamic updates of web pages
JavaScript is a scripting language that was initially developed in 1995 by Brendan Eich , then of Netscape , for use within web pages. [35] The standardised version is ECMAScript . [35] To make web pages more interactive, some web applications also use JavaScript techniques such as Ajax ( asynchronous JavaScript and XML ). Client-side script is delivered with the page that can make additional HTTP requests to the server, either in response to user actions such as mouse movements or clicks, or based on elapsed time. The server's responses are used to modify the current page rather than creating a new page with each response, so the server needs only to provide limited, incremental information. Multiple Ajax requests can be handled at the same time, and users can interact with the page while data is retrieved. Web pages may also regularly poll the server to check whether new information is available. [36]

WWW prefix
Many hostnames used for the World Wide Web begin with www because of the long-standing practice of naming Internet hosts according to the services they provide. The hostname of a web server is often www , in the same way that it may be ftp for an FTP server , and news or nntp for a USENET news server . These host names appear as Domain Name System (DNS) or subdomain names, as in www.example.com . The use of www is not required by any technical or policy standard and many web sites do not use it; indeed, the first ever web server was called nxoc01.cern.ch . [37] According to Paolo Palazzi, [38] who worked at CERN along with Tim Berners-Lee, the popular use of www as subdomain was accidental; the World Wide Web project page was intended to be published at www.cern.ch while info.cern.ch was intended to be the CERN home page, however the DNS records were never switched, and the practice of prepending www to an institution's website domain name was subsequently copied. Many established websites still use the prefix, or they employ other subdomain names such as www2 , secure or en for special purposes. Many such web servers are set up so that both the main domain name (e.g., example.com) and the www subdomain (e.g., www.example.com) refer to the same site; others require one form or the other, or they may map to different web sites. The use of a subdomain name is useful for load balancing incoming web traffic by creating a CNAME record that points to a cluster of web servers. Since, currently, only a subdomain can be used in a CNAME, the same result cannot be achieved by using the bare domain root. [ citation needed ]
When a user submits an incomplete domain name to a web browser in its address bar input field, some web browsers automatically try adding the prefix "www" to the beginning of it and possibly ".com", ".org" and ".net" at the end, depending on what might be missing. For example, entering 'microsoft' may be transformed to http://www.microsoft.com/ and 'openoffice' to http://www.openoffice.org . This feature started appearing in early versions of Firefox , when it still had the working title 'Firebird' in early 2003, from an earlier practice in browsers such as Lynx . [39] [ unreliable source? ] It is reported that Microsoft was granted a US patent for the same idea in 2008, but only for mobile devices. [40]
In English, www is usually read as double-u double-u double-u . [41] Some users pronounce it dub-dub-dub , particularly in New Zealand. Stephen Fry, in his "Podgrams" series of podcasts, pronounces it wuh wuh wuh . [42] The English writer Douglas Adams once quipped in The Independent on Sunday (1999): "The World Wide Web is the only thing I know of whose shortened form takes three times longer to say than what it's short for". [43] In Mandarin Chinese, World Wide Web is commonly translated via a phono-semantic matching to wàn wéi wǎng ( 万维网 ), which satisfies www and literally means "myriad dimensional net", [44] a translation that reflects the design concept and proliferation of the World Wide Web. Tim Berners-Lee's web-space states that World Wide Web is officially spelled as three separate words, each capitalised, with no intervening hyphens. [45] Use of the www prefix has been declining, especially when Web 2.0 web applications sought to brand their domain names and make them easily pronounceable. [46] As the mobile Web grew in popularity, services like Gmail .com, Outlook.com , Myspace .com, Facebook .com and Twitter .com are most often mentioned without adding "www." (or, indeed, ".com") to the domain.

Scheme specifiers
The scheme specifiers http:// and https:// at the start of a web URI refer to Hypertext Transfer Protocol or HTTP Secure , respectively. They specify the communication protocol to use for the request and response. The HTTP protocol is fundamental to the operation of the World Wide Web, and the added encryption layer in HTTPS is essential when browsers send or retrieve confidential data, such as passwords or banking information. Web browsers usually automatically prepend http:// to user-entered URIs, if omitted.

Web security
For criminals , the Web has become a venue to spread malware and engage in a range of cybercrimes , including identity theft , fraud , espionage and intelligence gathering . [47] Web-based vulnerabilities now outnumber traditional computer security concerns, [48] [49] and as measured by Google , about one in ten web pages may contain malicious code. [50] Most web-based attacks take place on legitimate websites, and most, as measured by Sophos , are hosted in the United States, China and Russia. [51] The most common of all malware threats is SQL injection attacks against websites. [52] Through HTML and URIs, the Web was vulnerable to attacks like cross-site scripting (XSS) that came with the introduction of JavaScript [53] and were exacerbated to some degree by Web 2.0 and Ajax web design that favours the use of scripts. [54] Today by one estimate, 70% of all websites are open to XSS attacks on their users. [55] Phishing is another common threat to the Web. "SA, the Security Division of EMC, today announced the findings of its January 2013 Fraud Report, estimating the global losses from phishing at $1.5 Billion in 2012". [56] Two of the well-known phishing methods are Covert Redirect and Open Redirect.
Proposed solutions vary. Large security companies like McAfee already design governance and compliance suites to meet post-9/11 regulations, [57] and some, like Finjan have recommended active real-time inspection of programming code and all content regardless of its source. [47] Some have argued that for enterprises to see Web security as a business opportunity rather than a cost centre , [58] while others call for "ubiquitous, always-on digital rights management " enforced in the infrastructure to replace the hundreds of companies that secure data and networks. [59] Jonathan Zittrain has said users sharing responsibility for computing safety is far preferable to locking down the Internet. [60]

Privacy
Every time a client requests a web page, the server can identify the request's IP address and usually logs it. Also, unless set not to do so, most web browsers record requested web pages in a viewable history feature, and usually cache much of the content locally. Unless the server-browser communication uses HTTPS encryption, web requests and responses travel in plain text across the Internet and can be viewed, recorded, and cached by intermediate systems. When a web page asks for, and the user supplies, personally identifiable information —such as their real name, address, e-mail address, etc.—web-based entities can associate current web traffic with that individual. If the website uses HTTP cookies , username and password authentication, or other tracking techniques, it can relate other web visits, before and after, to the identifiable information provided. In this way it is possible for a web-based organisation to develop and build a profile of the individual people who use its site or sites. It may be able to build a record for an individual that includes information about their leisure activities, their shopping interests, their profession, and other aspects of their demographic profile . These profiles are obviously of potential interest to marketeers, advertisers and others. Depending on the website's terms and conditions and the local laws that apply information from these profiles may be sold, shared, or passed to other organisations without the user being informed. For many ordinary people, this means little more than some unexpected e-mails in their in-box, or some uncannily relevant advertising on a future web page. For others, it can mean that time spent indulging an unusual interest can result in a deluge of further targeted marketing that may be unwelcome. Law enforcement, counter terrorism and espionage agencies can also identify, target and track individuals based on their interests or proclivities on the Web.
Social networking sites try to get users to use their real names, interests, and locations, rather than pseudonyms. These website's leaders believe this makes the social networking experience more engaging for users. On the other hand, uploaded photographs or unguarded statements can be identified to an individual, who may regret this exposure. Employers, schools, parents, and other relatives may be influenced by aspects of social networking profiles, such as text posts or digital photos, that the posting individual did not intend for these audiences. On-line bullies may make use of personal information to harass or stalk users. Modern social networking websites allow fine grained control of the privacy settings for each individual posting, but these can be complex and not easy to find or use, especially for beginners. [61] Photographs and videos posted onto websites have caused particular problems, as they can add a person's face to an on-line profile. With modern and potential facial recognition technology , it may then be possible to relate that face with other, previously anonymous, images, events and scenarios that have been imaged elsewhere. Because of image caching, mirroring and copying, it is difficult to remove an image from the World Wide Web.

Standards
Many formal standards and other technical specifications and software define the operation of different aspects of the World Wide Web, the Internet, and computer information exchange. Many of the documents are the work of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), headed by Berners-Lee, but some are produced by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and other organisations.
Usually, when web standards are discussed, the following publications are seen as foundational:
Additional publications provide definitions of other essential technologies for the World Wide Web, including, but not limited to, the following:

Accessibility
There are methods for accessing the Web in alternative mediums and formats to facilitate use by individuals with disabilities . These disabilities may be visual, auditory, physical, speech-related, cognitive, neurological, or some combination. Accessibility features also help people with temporary disabilities, like a broken arm, or ageing users as their abilities change. [62] The Web receives information as well as providing information and interacting with society. The World Wide Web Consortium claims that it is essential that the Web be accessible, so it can provide equal access and equal opportunity to people with disabilities. [63] Tim Berners-Lee once noted, "The power of the Web is in its universality. Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect." [62] Many countries regulate web accessibility as a requirement for websites. [64] International cooperation in the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative led to simple guidelines that web content authors as well as software developers can use to make the Web accessible to persons who may or may not be using assistive technology . [62] [65]

Internationalisation
The W3C Internationalisation Activity assures that web technology works in all languages, scripts, and cultures. [66] Beginning in 2004 or 2005, Unicode gained ground and eventually in December 2007 surpassed both ASCII and Western European as the Web's most frequently used character encoding . [67] Originally RFC 3986 allowed resources to be identified by URI in a subset of US-ASCII. RFC 3987 allows more characters—any character in the Universal Character Set —and now a resource can be identified by IRI in any language. [68]

Statistics
Between 2005 and 2010, the number of web users doubled, and was expected to surpass two billion in 2010. [69] Early studies in 1998 and 1999 estimating the size of the Web using capture/recapture methods showed that much of the web was not indexed by search engines and the Web was much larger than expected. [70] [71] According to a 2001 study, there was a massive number, over 550 billion, of documents on the Web, mostly in the invisible Web, or Deep Web . [72] A 2002 survey of 2,024 million web pages [73] determined that by far the most web content was in the English language: 56.4%; next were pages in German (7.7%), French (5.6%), and Japanese (4.9%). A more recent study, which used web searches in 75 different languages to sample the Web, determined that there were over 11.5 billion web pages in the publicly indexable web as of the end of January 2005. [74] As of March 2009 [update] , the indexable web contains at least 25.21 billion pages. [75] On 25 July 2008, Google software engineers Jesse Alpert and Nissan Hajaj announced that Google Search had discovered one trillion unique URLs. [76] As of May 2009 [update] , over 109.5 million domains operated. [77] [ not in citation given ] Of these, 74% were commercial or other domains operating in the generic top-level domain com . [77] Statistics measuring a website's popularity, such as the Alexa Internet rankings, are usually based either on the number of page views or on associated server " hits " (file requests) that it receives.

Speed issues
Frustration over congestion issues in the Internet infrastructure and the high latency that results in slow browsing, "freezing" of Web pages, and slow loading of websites has led to a pejorative name for the World Wide Web: the World Wide Wait . [78] Speeding up the Internet is an ongoing discussion over the use of peering and QoS technologies. Other solutions to reduce the congestion can be found at W3C . [79] Guidelines for web response times are: [80]

Web caching
A web cache is a server computer located either on the public Internet, or within an enterprise that stores recently accessed web pages to improve response time for users when the same content is requested within a certain time after the original request. Most web browsers also implement a browser cache for recently obtained data, usually on the local disk drive. HTTP requests by a browser may ask only for data that has changed since the last access. Web pages and resources may contain expiration information to control caching to secure sensitive data, such as in online banking , or to facilitate frequently updated sites, such as news media. Even sites with highly dynamic content may permit basic resources to be refreshed only occasionally. Web site designers find it worthwhile to collate resources such as CSS data and JavaScript into a few site-wide files so that they can be cached efficiently. Enterprise firewalls often cache Web resources requested by one user for the benefit of many users. Some search engines store cached content of frequently accessed websites.

PLOS ONE
PLOS ONE (originally PLoS ONE ) is a peer-reviewed open access scientific journal published by the Public Library of Science (PLOS) since 2006. The journal covers primary research from any discipline within science and medicine . Operating under a pay-to-publish model, PLOS ONE publishes approximately 50% of submitted manuscripts. [1] All submissions go through a pre-publication review by a member of the board of academic editors, who can elect to seek an opinion from an external reviewer. According to the journal, papers are not to be excluded on the basis of lack of perceived importance or adherence to a scientific field. Although the number of submissions decreased from 2013 to 2014, PLOS ONE remained the world’s largest journal by number of papers published (about 30,000 a year, or 85 papers per day). Numbers decreased further to 22,000 published papers in 2016, [1] and since 2017 PLOS ONE is the second largest journal (after Scientific Reports ). [2]

History

Development
The Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation awarded PLOS a $9 million grant in December 2002 and $1 million grant in May 2006 for its financial sustainability and launch of new free-access biomedical journals. [3] [4] Later, PLOS ONE was launched in December 2006 as a beta version named PLoS ONE . It launched with Commenting and Note making functionality, and added the ability to rate articles in July 2007. In September 2007 the ability to leave " trackbacks " on articles was added. [5] In August 2008 it moved from a weekly publication schedule to a daily one, publishing articles as soon as they became ready. [6] In October 2008 PLoS ONE came out of "beta". Also in September 2009, as part of its Article-Level Metrics program, PLoS ONE made the full online usage data—e.g., HTML page views , PDF , XML downloads—for every published article publicly available. In mid-2012, as part of a rebranding of PLoS as PLOS, the journal changed its name to PLOS ONE . [7]

Output and turnaround
The number of papers published by PLOS ONE grew rapidly from inception to 2013 and has since declined somewhat. By 2010, it was estimated to have become the largest journal in the world, [9] and in 2011, 1 in 60 articles indexed by PubMed were published by PLOS ONE . [16]
At PLOS ONE , the median review time has grown from 37 days to 125 days over the first ten years of operation, according to Himmelstein's analysis, done for Nature . The median between acceptance and posting a paper on the site has decreased from 35 to 15 days over the same period. Both numbers for 2016 roughly correspond to the industry-wide averages for biology-related journals. [17] [18]

Management
The founding managing editor was Chris Surridge. [19] He was succeeded by Peter Binfield in March 2008, who was publisher until May 2012. [20] Damian Pattinson then held the chief editorial position until December 2015. [21] Joerg Heber was confirmed as editor-in-chief from November 2016. [22]

Publication concept
PLOS ONE is built on several conceptually different ideas compared to traditional peer-reviewed scientific publishing in that it does not use the perceived importance of a paper as a criterion for acceptance or rejection. The idea is that, instead, PLOS ONE only verifies whether experiments and data analysis were conducted rigorously, and leaves it to the scientific community to ascertain importance, post publication, through debate and comment. [23]
According to Nature , the journal's aim is to "challenge academia 's obsession with journal status and impact factors ". [25] Being an online-only publication allows PLOS ONE to publish more papers than a print journal. In an effort to facilitate publication of research on topics outside, or between, traditional science categories, it does not restrict itself to a specific scientific area. [23]
Papers published in PLOS ONE can be of any length, contain full color throughout, and contain supplementary materials such as multimedia files. Reuse of articles is subject to a Creative Commons Attribution License , version 2.5. In the first four years following launch, it made use of over 40,000 external peer reviewers. [26] The journal uses an international board of academic editors with over 6,000 academics handling submissions and publishes approximately 50 % of all submissions, after review by, on average, 2.9 experts. [27] Registered readers can leave comments on articles on the website. [25]

Business model
As with all journals of the Public Library of Science, PLOS ONE is financed by charging authors a publication fee . The "author-pays" model allows PLOS journals to provide all articles to everybody for free (i.e., open access) immediately after publication. As of October 2015, PLOS ONE charged authors US$1,495 [30] to publish an article. Depending on circumstances, it may waive or reduce the fee for authors who do not have sufficient funds. [31] This model has drawn criticism, however. In 2011 Richard Poynder posited that journals such as PLoS ONE that charge authors for publication rather than charging users for access may produce a conflict of interest that reduces peer review standards (accept more articles, earn more revenue). [32] Stevan Harnad instead argues for a "no fault" peer-review model, in which authors are charged for each round of peer review, regardless of the outcome, rather than for publication. [33] PLoS had been operating at a loss until 2009 but covered its operational costs for the first time in 2010, [34] largely due to the growth of PLOS ONE .

Influence
The " PLOS ONE model" has inspired a series of other journals, [35] [36] [37] having broad scope and low selectivity, now called megajournals , and a pay-to-publish model, usually published under Creative Commons licenses .

Reception
In September 2009, PLOS ONE received the Publishing Innovation Award of the Association for Learned and Professional Society Publishers . [38] The award is given in recognition of a "truly innovative approach to any aspect of publication as adjudged from originality and innovative qualities, together with utility, benefit to the community and long-term prospects". In January 2010, it was announced that the journal would be included in the Journal Citation Reports , [39] and the journal received an impact factor of 4.411 in 2010. According to the Journal Citation Reports , the journal has a 2015 impact factor of 3.057. [40] In 2015/2016 it had a "scijournal.org" impact factor of 4.411. [41]

Controversies

Alleged Sexism in one peer review instance
On April 29, 2015, Fiona Ingleby and Megan Head, postdoctoral fellows at the University of Sussex and Australian National University respectively, posted a rejection letter, which they said was sent to them by a peer reviewer for a journal they did not wish to name. The excerpt made negative comments about women's aptitude for science and advised Ingleby and Head to find male co-authors. Shortly afterward, the journal was reported to be PLOS ONE . By May 1, PLOS announced that it was severing ties with the reviewer responsible for the comments and asking the editor who relayed them to step down. PLOS ONE immediately issued a statement following the incident, written by PLOS ONE director Damian Pattinson, saying,
"I want to sincerely apologize for the distress the report caused the authors, and to make clear that we completely oppose the sentiments it expressed,"
He also stated that the journal was considering moving away from the tradition of anonymous peer review. [42]

CreatorGate
On March 3, 2016, the editors of PLOS ONE initiated a reevaluation of an article about the functioning of the human hand [43] due to outrage among the journal's readership over a reference to "Creator" inside the paper. [44] The authors, who received grants from the Chinese National Basic Research Program and National Natural Science Foundation of China for this work, responded by saying "Creator" is a poorly-translated idiom ( 造化 ( 者 ), literally "(that which) creates or transforms") [45] which means "nature" in the Chinese language. Despite the authors' protests, the article was retracted . [46] "Creator" is found in the paper in three sentences:
A less sympathetic explanation for the use of "Creator" was suggested to The Chronicle of Higher Education by Chinese-language experts who noted that the academic editor listed on the paper, Renzhi Han, previously worked at the Chinese Evangelical Church in Iowa City. [47]
Sarah Kaplan of The Washington Post presented detailed analysis of the problem, which she named #CreatorGate , and concluded that the journal’s hasty retraction may have been an even bigger offense than the publication of the paper in the first place. [48] To contrast PLOS ONE' s handling of the problem, she used a 12-year history of retraction of the fraudulent paper on vaccine and autism by The Lancet and no retraction of debunked study on " arsenic life " by Science . [49] [50] Others added the history of the article in Nature on " water memory " that was not retracted either. [51]
Jonathan Eisen , chair of advisory board of a sister journal PLOS Biology and an advocate for open-access , defended PLOS ONE for prompt response to social media , which in his words "most journals pretend doesn’t even exist". [52] David Knutson issued a statement about the paper processing at PLOS ONE , which praised the importance of post-publication peer review and described their intention to offer open signed reviews in order to ensure accountability of the process. [53] From March 2 to 9, the research article received total 67 post-publication reader comments and 129 responses on PLOS ONE site, the first one from cell biologist turned science journalist Leonid Schneider who cited a Wikipedia article rather than scientific literature as an authority. [54] [55] Signe Dean of SBS put #CreatorGate in perspective: it is not the most scandalous retraction in science, yet it shows how a social media outrage storm does expedite a retraction. [56]
The dissemination activity on social media within one week of publicity was:
The article was viewed 169,926 times on PLOS site in the first ten days of March, compared to 555 views in January and 116 views in February. [57]
On March 10, 2016, BioLogos , a website of a Christian advocacy group established by the 16th Director of the National Institutes of Health Francis Collins after publication of his book The Language of God: A Scientist Presents Evidence for Belief , started Blog series Faith and Science Seeking Understanding to review the controversy raised by #CreatorGate. [58] The series follows the accusations of anti-Christian/anti-”design” bias in the scientific world by Ken Ham of Answers in Genesis and David Klinghoffer of Evolution News and Views . [59] [60] BioLogos authors argue that avoiding mentions of God in scientific literature is not a censorship but a rule of a successful game akin to the rules of soccer or football . [61] [62]

Systemic bias
Systemic bias , also called institutional bias , is the inherent tendency of a process to support particular outcomes. The term generally refers to human systems such as institutions; the equivalent bias in non-human systems (such as measurement instruments or mathematical models used to estimate physical quantities) is often called systematic bias , and leads to systematic error in measurements or estimates. The issues of systemic bias are dealt with extensively in the field of industrial organization economics.

In human institutions
Cognitive bias is inherent in the experiences, loyalties, and relationships of people in their daily lives, and new biases are constantly being discovered and addressed on both an ethical and political level. For example, the goal of affirmative action in the United States is to counter biases concerning gender, race, and ethnicity , by opening up institutional participation to people with a wider range of backgrounds, and hence a wider range of points of view. In India , the system of scheduled castes and tribes intends to address systemic bias caused by the controversial caste system, a system centered on organized discrimination based upon one's ancestry, not unlike the system that affirmative action aims to counter. Both the scheduling system and affirmative action mandate the hiring of citizens from within designated groups. However, without sufficient restrictions based upon the actual socio-economic standing of the recipients of the aid provided, these types of system can, and allegedly do, result in the unintentional institutionalization of a reversed form of the same systemic bias, [1] which works against the goal of rendering institutional participation open to people with a wider range of backgrounds. It can therefore be argued that all human institutions can do is to minimize bias as much as possible, and utilize education to increase awareness of it wherever possible.

Major causes
The study of systemic bias as part of the field titled organizational behavior in industrial organization economics is studied in several principle modalities in both non-profit and for-profit institutions. The issue of concern is that patterns of behavior may develop within large institutions which become harmful to the productivity and viability of the larger institutions from which they develop. The three major categories of study for maladaptive organizational behavior and systemic bias are counterproductive work behavior, human resource mistreatment, and the amelioration of stress-inducing behavior.

Counterproductive work behavior
Counterproductive work behavior , or CWB, consists of behavior by employees that harms or intends to harm organizations and people in organizations. [2]

Mistreatment of human resources
There are several types of mistreatment that employees endure in organizations.

Abusive supervision
Abusive supervision is the extent to which a supervisor engages in a pattern of behavior that harms subordinates. [3]

Bullying
Although definitions of bullying vary, it involves a repeated pattern of harmful behaviors directed towards an individual. [4]

Incivility
Incivility consists of low-intensity discourteous and rude behavior with ambiguous intent to harm that violates norms for appropriate behavior in the workplace. [5]

Sexual harassment
Sexual harassment is behavior that denigrates or mistreats an individual due to his or her gender, creates an offensive workplace, and interferes with an individual being able to do their job. [6]

Stress
Occupational stress concerns the imbalance between the demands (aspects of the job that require mental or physical effort) and resources that help cope with these demands. [7]

Examples
Financial Week reported May 5, 2008 ( emphasis added ):

Versus systematic bias
The difference between the words systemic and systematic is somewhat ambiguous.
"Systemic bias" and the older, more common expression "systematic bias" are often used to refer to the same thing; some users [ who? ] seek to draw a distinction between them [ why? ] , suggesting that systemic bias is most frequently associated with human systems, and related to favoritism . [ citation needed ]
In engineering and computational mechanics , the word bias is sometimes used as a synonym of systematic error . In this case, the bias is referred to the result of a measurement or computation, rather than to the measurement instrument or computational method. [9]
Some authors try to draw a distinction between systemic and systematic corresponding to that between unplanned and planned, or to that between arising from the characteristics of a system and from an individual flaw. In a less formal sense, systemic biases are sometimes said to arise from the nature of the interworkings of the system, whereas systematic biases stem from a concerted effort to favor certain outcomes. Consider the difference between affirmative action (systematic) compared to racism and caste (systemic). [ citation needed ]

Hoover Institution
The Hoover Institution is an American public policy think tank and research institution located at Stanford University in California . Its official name is the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution, and Peace . It began as a library founded in 1919 by Republican Herbert Hoover , before he became President of the United States . The library, known as the Hoover Institution Library and Archives , houses multiple archives related to Hoover, World War I, World War II, and other world history. According to the 2016 Global Go To Think Tank Index Report ( Think Tanks and Civil Societies Program , University of Pennsylvania ), Hoover is #18 (of 90) in the "Top Think Tanks in the United States". [2]
The Hoover Institution is a unit of Stanford University [3] but has its own board of overseers. [4] It is located on the campus. Its mission statement outlines its basic tenets: representative government, private enterprise, peace, personal freedom, and the safeguards of the American system. [5] The institution is generally described as conservative , [6] [7] [8] although directors and others associated with it resist this description, saying that the institution is not partisan and that its goal is "to advance ideas of supporting freedom and free enterprise". [9]
The institution has been a place of scholarship for individuals who previously held high-profile positions in government, such as George Shultz , Condoleezza Rice , Michael Boskin , Edward Lazear , John B. Taylor , Edwin Meese , and Amy Zegart —all Hoover Institution fellows. In 2007, retired U.S. Army General John P. Abizaid , former commander of the U.S. Central Command , was named the Institution's first annual Annenberg Distinguished Visiting Fellow. [10]
The institution is housed in three buildings on the Stanford campus. The most prominent facility is the landmark Hoover Tower , which is a popular visitor attraction. The tower features an observation deck on the top level that provides visitors with a panoramic view of the Stanford campus and surrounding area.

Mission statement
Herbert Hoover's 1959 statement to the Board of Trustees of Stanford University on the purpose of the Hoover Institution continues to guide its ideology and define its activities:
The Hoover Institution's website says: "By collecting knowledge, generating ideas, and disseminating both, the Institution seeks to secure and safeguard peace, improve the human condition, and limit government intrusion into the lives of individuals." [5]

History
The Institution was set up by Herbert Hoover , one of Stanford's first graduates, who would later become the 31st President of the United States. He had been in charge of American relief efforts in Europe after World War I. Hoover's express purpose was to collect the records of contemporary history as it was happening. Hoover's helpers frequently risked their lives to rescue documentary and rare printed material, especially from countries under Nazi or Communist rule. Their many successes included the papers of Rosa Luxemburg , the Goebbels Diaries , and the records of the Russian secret police in Paris. Research institutes were also set up under Hoover's influence, though inevitably there were to be clashes between the moving force, Hoover, and the host university. [11]
In 1919, Hoover donated $50,000 to Stanford University to support the collection of primary materials related to World War I, a project that became known as the Hoover War Collection. Supported primarily by gifts from private donors, the Hoover War Collection flourished in its early years. In 1922, the Collection became known as the Hoover War Library . The Hoover War Library was housed in the Stanford Library , separate from the general stacks. By 1926, the Hoover War Library was known as the largest library in the world devoted to the Great War. By 1929, it contained 1.4 million items and was becoming too large to house in the Stanford Library. In 1938, the War Library revealed building plans for Hoover Tower , which was to be its permanent home independent of the Stanford Library system. The tower was completed in 1941, Stanford University's fiftieth anniversary. [12]
By 1946, the agenda of the Hoover War Library had expanded to include research activities; thus the organization was renamed the Hoover Institution and Library on War, Revolution and Peace. At this time, Herbert Hoover was living in New York City but remained integrally involved in the Hoover Institution and Library as a benefactor, fundraiser, and consultant.
In 1956 former President Hoover, under the auspices of the Institution and Library, launched a major fundraising campaign that allowed the Institution to realize its current form as a think tank and archive. In 1957, the Hoover Institution and Library was renamed the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace—the name it holds today. [13]
In 1960, W. Glenn Campbell was appointed director and substantial budget increases soon led to corresponding increases in acquisitions and related research projects. In particular, the Chinese and Russian collections grew considerably. Despite student unrest in the 1960s, the institution continued to thrive and develop closer relations with Stanford. [14]
John Raisian served as director from 1989 to 2015. Thomas W. Gilligan succeeded him in 2015.

Tyler Cowen
Tyler Cowen ( / ˈ k aʊ . ən / ; born January 21, 1962) is an American economist, who is an economics professor at George Mason University , where he holds the Holbert C. Harris chair in the economics department. [1] He hosts a popular economics blog , Marginal Revolution , together with his co-author, Alex Tabarrok . Cowen and Tabarrok have also started the website Marginal Revolution University , a venture in online education .
Cowen writes the "Economic Scene" column for the New York Times , and since July 2016 has been a regular opinion columnist at Bloomberg View . [2] He also writes for such publications as The New Republic , the Wall Street Journal , Forbes , Newsweek , and the Wilson Quarterly . He serves as general director of George Mason's Mercatus Center , a university research center that focuses on the market economy .
In February 2011, Cowen received a nomination as one of the most influential economists in the last decade in a survey by The Economist . [3] He was ranked #72 among the "Top 100 Global Thinkers" in 2011 by Foreign Policy Magazine "for finding markets in everything." [4]

Education and personal life
Cowen was born in Bergen County , [5] New Jersey . At 15, he became the youngest ever New Jersey state chess champion. [6] [7]
He graduated from George Mason University with a bachelor of science degree in economics in 1983 and received his PhD in economics from Harvard University in 1987 with his thesis titled Essays in the theory of welfare economics . At Harvard, he was mentored by game theorist Thomas Schelling , the 2005 recipient of the Nobel Prize in Economics . He is married to Natasha Cowen, a lawyer.

Writings

Culture
The Los Angeles Times has described Cowen as "a man who can talk about Haitian voodoo flags, Iranian cinema , Hong Kong cuisine , Abstract Expressionism , Zairian music and Mexican folk art with seemingly equal facility." [8] One of Cowen's primary research interests is the economics of culture. He has written books on fame ( What Price Fame? ), art ( In Praise of Commercial Culture ), and cultural trade ( Creative Destruction: How Globalization is Changing the World's Cultures ). In Markets and Cultural Voices , he relays how globalization is changing the world of three Mexican amate painters. Cowen argues that free markets change culture for the better, allowing them to evolve into something more people want. Other books include Public Goods and Market Failures , The Theory of Market Failure , Explorations in the New Monetary Economics , Risk and Business Cycles , Economic Welfare , and New Theories of Market Failure .

Recent books
Cowen followed the controversial success of his The Great Stagnation with An Economist Gets Lunch: New Rules for Everyday Foodies , "taking on food with equally provocative ideas." [9]
The Great Stagnation: How America Ate All The Low-Hanging Fruit of Modern History, Got Sick, and Will (Eventually) Feel Better is a short, 15,000-word, take on the United States' recent economic trajectory released in January 2011. Create Your Own Economy: The Path to Prosperity in a Disordered World was released in July 2009 (and rereleased in 2010, with the new title The Age of the Infovore: Succeeding in the Information Economy ) and received favorable reviews from critics including Matthew Yglesias and Tim Harford .
In 2013, he published Average is Over , on the future of modern economies.
HIs most recent book, The Complacent Class: The Self-Defeating Quest for the American Dream (St. Martins Press, February 2017) discusses how the change that has moved America forward has stopped. According to Malcolm Gladwell , "His brilliant new book...has been on my nightstand after I devoured it in one sitting. I am at round-the-clock Cowen saturation right now." [source?]

New York Times
Cowen's New York Times columns cover a wide range of issues, such as the 2008 financial crisis: "Too Few Regulations? No, Just Ineffective Ones" .

Dining guide
His dining guide for the DC area , "Tyler Cowen's Ethnic Dining Guide," was reprinted in the Food section of the Washington Post .

Political philosophy
Cowen has written papers in political philosophy and ethics: for example, he co-wrote a paper with the philosopher Derek Parfit , arguing against the social discount rate . [10] A recent paper has argued that the epistemic problem fails to refute consequentialist forms of argument. [11] Cowen has been described as a " libertarian bargainer," a moderate libertarian [ clarification needed ] who can influence practical policy making. [12] In a 2007 article entitled " The Paradox of Libertarianism ," Cowen argued that libertarians "should embrace a world with growing wealth, growing positive liberty, and yes, growing government. We don't have to favor the growth in government per se, but we do need to recognize that sometimes it is a package deal."
Cowen endorsed bailouts in a March 2, 2009 column in the New York Times . [13]
In 2012, David Brooks called Cowen one of the most influential bloggers on the right, writing that he is among those who "start from broadly libertarian premises but do not apply them in a doctrinaire way." [14]
In an August 2014 blog post, Cowen wrote, "Just to summarize, I generally favor much more immigration but not open borders , I am a liberal on most but not all social issues, and I am market-oriented on economic issues. On most current foreign policy issues I am genuinely agnostic as to what exactly we should do but skeptical that we are doing the right thing at the moment. I don’t like voting for either party or for third parties." [15]

Attack
On March 26, 2014, Cowen was attacked while teaching "Law and Literature" in his classroom by Jonathan Pendleton, who tried to perform a "citizen's arrest" of the professor and then pepper sprayed him. [16] A bystander intervened and Pendelton was detained and arrested shortly after by police. Cowen and his students reportedly suffered no lasting injuries. Pendelton reportedly believed that Cowen had "controlled his mind at a distance" and sexually harassed him. [17]

Conflict-of-interest editing on Wikipedia
Conflict-of-interest (COI) editing on Wikipedia occurs when editors use Wikipedia to advance the interests of their external roles or relationships. The type of COI editing of most concern on Wikipedia is paid editing for public relations (PR) purposes. [1] Several Wikipedia policies and guidelines exist to combat conflict of interest editing, including Wikipedia:Conflict of interest and Wikipedia:Paid-contribution disclosure .
Controversies reported by the media include United States congressional staff editing articles about members of Congress in 2006; Microsoft offering a software engineer money to edit articles on competing code standards in 2007; the PR firm Bell Pottinger editing articles about its clients in 2011; and the discovery in 2012 that British MPs or their staff had removed criticism from articles about those MPs. The media has also written about COI editing by BP , the Central Intelligence Agency , Diebold , Portland Communications , Sony , the Vatican , and several others.
In 2012 Wikipedia launched one of its largest sockpuppet investigations, when editors reported suspicious activity suggesting 250 accounts had been used to engage in paid editing. Wikipedia traced the edits to a firm known as Wiki-PR , and the accounts were banned. In 2015, Operation Orangemoody uncovered another paid-editing scam, in which over 380 accounts were used to extort money from businesses to create and ostensibly protect promotional articles about them.

Wikipedia on conflict-of-interest editing
Wikipedia:Conflict of interest , a guideline, "strongly discourages" COI editing, and advises those with a financial conflict of interest, including paid editors, to refrain from direct article editing. Wikipedia:Paid-contribution disclosure , a policy, requires that editors disclose their "employer, client, and affiliation" with respect to any contribution for which they are paid, including talk-page contributions.
In 2013 Sue Gardner , then-executive director of the Wikimedia Foundation, called "paid editing for promotional purposes" a "' black hat ' practice." [1] The law firm Cooley LLP , in a cease and desist letter to Wiki-PR , wrote that "this practice violates the Wikimedia Foundation's terms of use, including but not limited to Section 4, which prohibits users from 'engaging in false statements, impersonation, or fraud', and '...misrepresenting your affiliation with any individual or entity, or using the username of another user with the intent to deceive'." [2] In 2014 the Wikimedia Foundation updated their terms of use to require that editors disclose their "employer, client, and affiliation with respect to any contribution for which [they] receive, or expect to receive, compensation." [3]
Companies have argued for greater leeway in conflict-of-interest editing, citing Wikipedia:Ignore all rules , a policy, which states: "If a rule prevents you from improving or maintaining Wikipedia, ignore it." [4]

Laws against covert advertising

United States Federal Trade Commission
The Federal Trade Commission has published a guide to its regulations to implement federal law concerning the use of endorsements and testimonials in advertising at Endorsement Guidelines and Dot Com Disclosures . [5] [6]

European fair trading law
In May 2012 the Munich Oberlandesgericht court confirmed a ruling against a company which edited Wikipedia articles with the aim of influencing customers. It viewed the edits as undeclared commercial practice according to The Act against unfair Competition Section 4, 3 [7] as it constituted covert advertising, and as such were a violation of European fair trading law (see the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive ). The ruling stated that readers cannot be expected to seek out user and talk pages to find editors' disclosures about their corporate affiliation. The case arose out of a claim against a company by a competitor over edits made to the article Weihrauchpräparat on the German Wikipedia. [8] [9]
The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) in the UK reached a similar decision in June 2012 in relation to material about Nike on Twitter. The ASA found that the content of certain tweets from two footballers had been "agreed with the help of a member of the Nike marketing team." The tweets were not clearly identified as Nike marketing communications, and were therefore in breach of the ASA's code. [10]

Incidents

Jimmy Wales
In December 2005, it was noticed that Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales had edited his own Wikipedia entry. According to public logs, he has edited his biography 19 times, [11] as of 9 September 2013, seven times altering information about whether Larry Sanger was a co-founder of Wikipedia. It was also revealed that Wales had edited the Wikipedia article of his former company, Bomis . "Bomis Babes", a section of the Bomis website, had been characterized in the article as " soft-core pornography ", but Wales revised this to "adult content section" and deleted mentions of pornography. He said he was fixing an error, and did not agree with calling Bomis Babes soft porn. Wales conceded that he had made the changes, but maintained that they were technical corrections. [12]

United States Congressional staffers
In 2006, it was discovered that more than 1,000 changes had been made to Wikipedia articles originating from United States government IP addresses. Changes had been made to articles about Representative Marty Meehan , [13] Senator Tom Coburn , Senator Norm Coleman , [14] Representative Gil Gutknecht , [15] Senator Joe Biden , [15] Senator Conrad Burns , [16] Senator Dianne Feinstein , [17] Senator Tom Harkin , [17] Representative David Davis , [18] Tennessee state representative Matthew Hill [18] [19] and then-Representative Mike Pence . [20] The edits removed accurate but critical information and embellished positive descriptions. [17] In response to the controversy, certain affected IP addresses were temporarily blocked. [21]
Later, in 2011, conflicted edits were also made to US Congressional representative David Rivera 's article. [22]

MyWikiBiz
In August 2006 Gregory Kohs, a market researcher from Pennsylvania , founded MyWikiBiz, a company offering to write inexpensive Wikipedia entries for businesses. [23] In January 2007, Kohs said that in his view Wikipedia's coverage of major corporations was deficient, stating that "It is strange that a minor Pokemon character will get a 1,200-word article, but a Fortune 500 company will get ... maybe 100 words". A few days after issuing a press release about his business, Kohs' Wikipedia account was blocked. Kohs later recalled a phone call with Jimmy Wales who told him MyWikiBiz was "antithetical" to the mission of the encyclopedia. [24] Kohs said it surprised him that PR agencies were discouraged from editing articles: "There are around 130 'Fortune 1,000' companies absent from Wikipedia's pages ... How could they not benefit from a little PR help?" [25]

Microsoft
In January 2007, Australian software engineer Rick Jelliffe revealed that Microsoft had offered to pay him to edit Wikipedia articles on two competing code standards, OpenDocumentFormat and Microsoft Office Open XML . [26] Jelliffe, who described himself as a technical expert and not an advocate for Microsoft, [27] [28] said he accepted the offer because he wanted the information on technical standards to be accurate. [27] Microsoft subsequently confirmed that it had offered to pay Jelliffe to edit the articles, stating that they were seeking "more balance" in the entries, [26] that articles contained inaccuracies, [29] that prior efforts to get attention from Wikipedia volunteers had failed, and that Microsoft had agreed that the company would not review Jelliffe's suggested changes. Microsoft also said they had not previously hired anyone to edit Wikipedia. [27]
Heated debate resulted after the revelation over whether such practices called Wikipedia's credibility into question. [26] In response to the incident, Jimmy Wales said paying for edits to Wikipedia was against the encyclopedia's spirit. [27] [30] Wales said the better, more transparent choice would have been for Microsoft to produce a white paper on the subject, post it online, and link to it from Wikipedia. [30] He also stated "Although agencies and employees should not edit our pages, they do – but perhaps less than you would expect." [25]
Volunteer Wikipedia spokesperson David Gerard said, "[Wikipedia] tends not to look favorably in terms of conflict of interest, and paying someone is a conflict." [26] Gerard added that public relations representatives commonly get blocked from editing by Wikipedia administrators. [26]
In the same month that had seen conflict of interest issues raised by both Microsoft and MyWikiBiz, Wales stated that editors should not be paid to edit, and PR agencies would be banned if they persisted. [25]

WikiScanner
In 2007 Virgil Griffith, a Caltech computation and neural-systems graduate student, created a searchable database that linked changes made by anonymous Wikipedia editors to companies and organizations from which the changes were made. The database cross-referenced logs of Wikipedia edits with publicly available records pertaining to the internet IP addresses edits were made from. [31]
Griffith was motivated by the edits from the United States Congress, and wanted to see if others were similarly promoting themselves. He was particularly interested in finding scandals, especially at large and controversial corporations. He said he wanted to, "create minor public relations disasters for companies and organizations I dislike (and) to see what 'interesting organizations' (which I am neutral towards) are up to." [32] He also wanted to give Wikipedia readers a tool to check edits for accuracy [31] and allow the automation and indexing of edits. [33]
Most of the edits Wikiscanner found were minor or harmless, [31] but the site was mined to detect the most controversial and embarrassing instance of conflict of interest edits. [34] These instances received media coverage worldwide. Included among the accused were the Vatican , [35] [36] the CIA , [31] [36] [37] the Federal Bureau of Investigation , [32] the US Democratic Party's Congressional Campaign Committee, [36] [38] the US Republican Party , [33] [38] Britain's Labour Party , [38] Britain's Conservative Party , [33] the Canadian government , [39] Industry Canada , [40] the Department of Prime Minister, Cabinet, and Defence in Australia, [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] the United Nations , [46] the US Senate , [47] the US Department of Homeland Security , [48] the US Environmental Protection Agency , [48] Montana Senator Conrad Burns , [31] Ohio Governor Bob Taft , [49] the Israeli government , [50] Exxon Mobil , [51] Walmart , [31] [51] AstraZeneca , Diebold , [31] [33] [38] Dow Chemical , [33] Disney , [39] Dell , [51] Anheuser-Busch , [52] Nestlé , [33] Pepsi , Boeing , [33] Sony Computer Entertainment , [53] EA , [54] SCO Group , [52] MySpace , [33] Pfizer , [48] Raytheon , [48] DuPont , [55] Anglican and Catholic churches, [33] the Church of Scientology , [33] [39] the World Harvest Church , [49] Amnesty International , [33] the Discovery Channel , [33] Fox News , [38] [56] CBS , The Washington Post , the National Rifle Association , [33] News International , [33] Al Jazeera , [48] Bob Jones University , [48] and Ohio State University . [49]
Although the edits correlated with known IP addresses, there was no proof that the changes actually came from a member of the organization or employee of the company, only that someone had access to their network. [36]
Wikipedia spokespersons received WikiScanner positively, noting that it helped prevent conflicts of interest from influencing articles [32] as well as increasing transparency [36] and mitigating attempts to remove or distort relevant facts. [33]
In 2008 Griffith released an updated version of WikiScanner called WikiWatcher, which also exploited a common mistake made by users with registered accounts who accidentally forget to log in, revealing their IP address and subsequently their affiliations. [57] As of March 2012 WikiScanner's website was online, but not functioning. [58]

Israel
In 2008 the pro-Israel activist group Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America (CAMERA) launched a campaign to alter Wikipedia articles to support the Israeli side of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict . The campaign suggested that pro-Israeli editors should pretend to be interested in other topics until elected as administrators. Once administrators they were to misuse their administrative powers to suppress pro-Palestinian editors and support pro-Israel editors. [59] Some members of this conspiracy were banned by Wikipedia administrators. [60]
In 2010 two pro- settler Israeli groups, Yesha Council and Israel Sheli, launched courses to instruct pro-Israel editors on how to use Wikipedia to promote Israel's point of view. A prize was to be given to the editor who inserted the most pro-Israel changes. [61]

Church of Scientology
In 2008 a long-running dispute between members of the Church of Scientology and Wikipedia editors reached Wikipedia's arbitration committee. The church members were accused of attempting to sway articles in the church's interests, while other editors were accused of the opposite. The arbitration committee unanimously voted to block all edits from the IP addresses associated with the church; several Scientology critics were banned too. [62]

2008 U.S. presidential campaign
During the 2008 U.S. presidential election , changes made by both Barack Obama and John McCain 's campaigns made the news. [63] A user who later claimed to work for the McCain campaign made changes to Sarah Palin 's article just before the announcement that she would run for the vice-presidency. [64]

Koch brothers use of PR firm
In 2010, Koch Industries began employing New Media Strategies (NMS), an internet PR firm specializing in "word-of-mouth marketing". Shortly afterwards, it was discovered that employees of the company, editing from IPs controlled by NMS, were editing the Wikipedia articles for Charles Koch , David Koch , Political activities of the Koch brothers , and The Science of Success (a book written by Charles). Under numerous usernames, NMS employees edited Wikipedia articles "to distance the Koch family from the Tea Party movement, to provide baseless comparisons between Koch and conspiracy theories surrounding George Soros , and to generally delete citations to liberal news outlets." These activities were exposed at Wikipedia and described in the press. [65] A large group of editors who were editing from NMS IPs became the subject of a sockpuppet investigation , were blocked, and later unblocked. [66]

London-based "PR fixer"
In June 2011 PR Week reported on a "fixer", a known but unnamed London-based figure in the PR industry who offered services to "cleanse" articles. Wikipedia entries this person was accused of changing included Carphone Warehouse co-founder David Ross , Von Essen Group chairman Andrew Davis , British property developer David Rowland , billionaire Saudi tycoon Maan Al-Sanea , and Edward Stanley, 19th Earl of Derby . According to PR Week , 42 edits were made from the same IP address, most of them removing negative or controversial information, or adding positive information. [67]

Bell Pottinger
In December 2011, blogger Tim Ireland, The Independent , and the British Bureau of Investigative Journalism (BIJ) discovered that Bell Pottinger , one of the UK's largest public relations companies, had manipulated articles on behalf of its clients. [68] Wikipedians discovered up to 19 accounts, 10 of which had over 100 edits each, which traced back to Bell Pottinger's offices; as a result of the investigation 10 of the accounts were blocked. [69] Bell Pottinger was accused of using sock or meatpuppets to edit pages to create the appearance of support for changes in articles. [70] One of the most noted accounts was registered under the name " Biggleswiki " [69] (an internal Wikipedia investigation resulted in several such cases). Bell Pottinger admitted that its employees had used several accounts, but said that the company had not done anything illegal. Analysis of the edits demonstrated that the changes had both added positive information and removed negative content, including the removal of information regarding the drug conviction of a businessman and Bell Pottinger client, and changing information about the arrest of a man convicted for commercial bribery . [68]
Undercover BIJ reporters made inquiries while posing as members of the Uzbek government; Bell Pottinger told them that the company offered "sorting" of negative information and criticism on Wikipedia articles, as well as other "dark arts". [68]
Jimmy Wales called Bell Pottinger's actions "ethical blindness." [68] Timothy Bell , the chairman, launched an internal review, but disagreed with Wales's view. He said, "You can destroy someone's reputation in one minute and it will take years to rebuild," and continued: "It's important for Wikipedia to recognise we are a valuable source for accurate information," and "apparently if you are not-for-profit what you say is true but that if you are a paid-for advocate you are lying." [71] The head of digital at Bell Pottinger blamed the incident on Wikipedia's "confusing" editing system and "the pressure put on us by clients to remove potentially defamatory or libellous statements very quickly, because Wikipedia is so authoritative." [72]

Portland Communications
In January 2012, British MP Tom Watson discovered that Portland Communications had been removing the nickname of one of its clients' products ("Wife Beater", referring to Anheuser-Busch InBev 's Stella Artois beer) from Wikipedia. Chartered Institute of Public Relations (CIPR) CEO Jane Wilson noted, "Stella Artois is on the 'wife-beater' page because it is a nick-name in common currency for that brand of strong continental lager. The brand managers who want to change this have a wider reputational issue to address, editing the term from a Wikipedia page will not get rid of this association." [73] Other edits from Portland's offices included changes to articles about another Portland client, the Kazakhstan 's BTA Bank , and its former head Mukhtar Ablyazov . Portland did not deny making the changes, arguing they had been done transparently and in accordance with Wikipedia's policies. [74] Portland Communications welcomed CIPR's subsequent announcement of a collaboration with Wikipedia and invited Jimmy Wales to speak to their company, as he did at Bell Pottinger . [75] Tom Watson was optimistic about the collaboration: "PR professionals need clear guidelines in this new world of online-information-sharing. That's why I am delighted that interested parties are coming together to establish a clear code of conduct." [76]

Newt Gingrich
Around the beginning of 2012, Joe DeSantis, the campaign communications director for American presidential candidate Newt Gingrich , argued for and made changes to Gingrich's Wikipedia article. [77] Some changes which DeSantis requested were minor, but his initial efforts tried to remove negative details which he thought unduly biased the articles, [78] including details about Gingrich's extramarital affairs, information about his financial expenditure, ethics charges against him, and his political positions on controversial issues. [78] [79]
The incident was notable for DeSantis' switch from editing articles about the politician and his wife directly, to following Wikipedia' conflict of interest guideline by using the linked discussion pages for each articles to suggest edits rather than make them himself. He said, "I stopped making direct edits in May 2011 because I was alerted to the COI rules...Earlier I thought that simply disclosing my affiliation was enough but it wasn't. So I started posting requests on the Talk page. This has been far more successful and the other editors on Wikipedia have largely received this very positively." [79] He told the political journalism organization Politico that his approach of working with the Wikipedia community by discussing edits on talk pages to be more successful than making the changes himself. Wikipedia editor Tvoz was quoted as critical of the practice; she wrote: "... I have to say this micro-managing by a Gingrich campaign director is a matter of concern to me even though you now are identifying yourself. Pointing out factual errors is one thing, but your input should not go beyond that, even [on a Talk page]." [78]

United Kingdom Parliament
In March 2012, the Bureau of Investigative Journalism uncovered that UK MPs or their staff had made almost 10,000 edits to the encyclopedia, and that almost one in six MPs had their Wikipedia article edited from within Parliament. [80] Many of the changes dealt with removing unflattering details from during the 2009 expenses scandal , as well as other controversial issues. [81] [82] Former MP Joan Ryan admitted to changing her entry "whenever there's misleading or untruthful information [that has] been placed on it." [81] Clare Short said her staff were "angry and protective" over mistakes and criticisms in her Wikipedia article and acknowledged they might have made changes to it. [81] Labour MP Fabian Hamilton also reported having one of his assistants edit a page to make it more accurate in his view. MP Philip Davies denied making changes about removing controversial comments related to Muslims from 2006 and 2007. [81]
The Sun newspaper alleged that in 2007 Labour MP Chuka Umunna , under the name Socialdemocrat created and repeatedly edited his own Wikipedia page. The newspaper highlighted edits such as those describing Umunna as the British Barack Obama. [83] Umunna told the Daily Telegraph that he did not alter his own Wikipedia page, but the paper quoted what they called "sources close to Umunna" as having told the newspaper that "it was possible that one of his campaign team in 2007, when he was trying to be selected to be Labour's candidate for Streatham in the 2010 general election, set up the page." [84]

Gibraltarpedia
In September 2012, controversy surrounded Wikimedia UK trustee Roger Bamkin, who along with OCLC Wikipedian in Residence Maximillian Klein, had been organizing an effort named Gibraltarpedia to create articles about Gibraltar in partnership with the Gibraltar Tourism Board. Articles written under this program were featured on the Wikipedia mainpage an unusually high 17 times in the course of a few weeks. [85] [86] This issue brought attention to organizational conflicts of interest regarding Wikimedia Movement partners, leading to an investigation of WMUK. [87] Bamkin stepped down as trustee following the media response. [88] Jimmy Wales commented, "It is wildly inappropriate for a board member of a chapter, or anyone else in an official role of any kind in a charity associated with Wikipedia, to take payment from customers in exchange for securing favorable placement on the front page of Wikimedia or anywhere else." [89] [90]

GEO Group
In February 2013, for-profit prison company GEO Group received major media coverage when a Wikipedia user under the name Abraham Cohen edited the entry on the company regarding naming rights to Florida Atlantic University (FAU) Stadium. GEO Group's Manager of Corporate Relations at the time was named Abraham Cohen, who is an FAU alumnus, former FAU student body president and former ex-officio member of the FAU board of trustees. [91] Eleven edits constituting the majority of all those changes had been made in a single day under a Wikipedia account named "Abraham Cohen", the only day on which that account has ever been used. [92] [93]

BP
In March 2013 it was reported that a member of BP 's press office had submitted drafts to rewrite the company's article, including sections dealing with its environmental record; the drafts were reviewed and added by other editors. [94] [95] [96] Estimates of the size of the contributions were as high as 44 percent of the article. [97] The BP press officer, who called himself "Arturo at BP," said he had chosen that name to make his affiliation clear, and noted that he had not directly edited the page. The development caused concern because the content was being produced by an employee, while "readers would be none the wiser." [94] Jimmy Wales was quoted in Salon.com , saying "I think that accusing [BP employee] Arturo of 'skirting' Wikipedia's rules in this case is fairly ludicrous – unless 'skirting' means 'going above and beyond what is required in order to be very clearly in compliance with best practice.' So, I would consider that a blatant factual misrepresentation." [97] The Wikipedia community intensely debated the ethics of the incident and how to handle it and other similar cases. [98]

WikiExperts
This company affirms that "WikiExperts employees do not directly edit Wikipedia. Instead, we act as a consulting company which outsources such editing to most suitable affiliated experts." [4]

Wiki-PR
In 2012, Wikipedia launched possibly one of the largest sock puppets investigations in its history after editors on its website reported suspicious activity suggesting a number of accounts were used to subvert Wikipedia's policies. After almost a year of investigation, over 250 sockpuppet accounts were allegedly found, operated by two independent networks of users. Wikipedia traced the edits and sockpuppetry back to a firm known as Wiki-PR, leading to a cease and desist letter by Sue Gardner issued to the founders of the organization. [99] The accounts were banned. On 25 October 2013, a community ban was further placed on Wiki-PR and any of its contractors.

Orangemoody
In 2015 Wikipedia blocked 381 accounts, many of them suspected sock puppets of the same people, after a two-month investigation, Operation Orangemoody, revealed they had been used to blackmail firms "struggling to get pages about their businesses on Wikipedia." These businesses had been told by Wikipedia users that articles about them had been "rejected due to concerns of excessive promotional content." In a few cases, the users asking for money were the same accounts that had earlier rejected the articles for publication. [100]
The scammers asked for hundreds of pounds to "protect or promote" the firms' interests. Wikipedia deleted 210 articles related to UK businesses, most of them of middle size. Individuals were also targeted. The investigation was named OrangeMoody by Wikipedia editors after the name of the first identified account. An unnamed Wikipedia spokesperson stated that "undisclosed paid advocacy editing may represent a serious conflict of interest and could compromise the quality of content on Wikipedia." [100]

Irish former Senator Jim Walsh
In September 2015 former senator Jim Walsh admitted editing his own Wikipedia entry, claiming it had been edited by "a person from the gay lobby groups". [101] He said that he had removed "certain erroneous comments" but did not say which edits he made. [101] T.J. McIntyre, a law lecturer at University College Dublin drew attention to edits made from an IP address belonging to the Oireachtas . [101] Edits made from that address included removal of controversial comments made by the former senator about gay people or the Marriage Equality referendum . [101]

2017 Burger King
On April 12, 2017, Burger King released a commercial in which an employee states that he could not explain a Whopper in 15 seconds, after which he states "OK Google, what is the Whopper burger?". The dialogue was designed to trigger voice searches on Android devices and Google Home smart speakers configured to automatically respond to the phrase "OK Google". [102] The specific query causes the device to read out a snippet sourced from Wikipedia 's article on the Whopper. However, prior to the ad's premiere, the article had been edited by users, including one named "Burger King Corporation", so that Google's automatically-generated response to the query would be a detailed description of the Whopper burger that utilized promotional language. The edits were reverted for violating Wikipedia's policies against blatant promotion. [103] [104]
Furthermore, the snippet became the target of vandals , who edited the article to claim that the sandwich contained such ingredients as " cyanide ", "a medium-sized child ", "rat meat" and "toenail clippings", while some users reported that Google Home had relayed information from these vandalized revisions. [105] [106] [102] Soon after the release of the commercial, Google blacklisted its audio so that it would not trigger the always-on voice detection. Wikipedia also protected the Whopper article to prevent the promotional descriptions or vandalism from being re-inserted. [105] In turn, Burger King modified the commercial in order to get around this block. [107]

Miscellaneous
In September 2007 changes were made about Prince Johan Friso and his wife Princess Mabel of the Netherlands, which were traced back to their palace. [108]
In April 2008 Phorm deleted material related to a controversy over its advertising deals. [109]
In September 2012, there was quite a bit of media attention surrounding two Wikipedia employees who were running a PR business on the side and editing Wikipedia on behalf of their clients. [110]
Edits involving Daimler AG were reported in March 2012. [111] In August that year, the communications director for Idaho 's Department of Education, Melissa McGrath, edited the article on her boss, Tom Luna . [112] In September it was revealed that Tory Party charmain Grant Shapps had changed the information about his academic record as well as donor information. [113] Also in September, writer Philip Roth wrote a piece in The New Yorker chronicling his difficulty changing information about one of his novels. [114] [115]
In October 2012, the Occupy Melbourne article was edited from a City of Melbourne IP address to alter language about recent protests, in the week leading up to the election of lord mayor Robert Doyle . Doyle denied any involvement or motive. [116]
In November, Finsbury , the firm led by Roland Rudd , was found to have anonymously edited the article about Alisher Usmanov , removing information about various controversies. [117]
In January 2014, the Wikimedia Foundation announced that Sarah Stierch was "no longer an employee of the Wikimedia Foundation", after evidence was presented on a Wikimedia mailing list that she had "been editing Wikipedia on behalf of paying clients" – a practice the Wikimedia Foundation said was "frowned upon by many in the editing community and by the Wikimedia Foundation". [118] [119] [120]
In June 2014, The Wall Street Journal reported that Banc de Binary , which had been cited for unregistered options trading by U.S. regulators, posted an advertisement on a freelancing bulletin board "offering more than $10,000 for 'crisis management'" of its Wikipedia page. [121]
In March 2015, The Washington Post reported that The New York Police Department had confirmed that at least some edits to Wikipedia entries about people who died following confrontations with NYPD officers were made from computers on the department’s servers. [122]

Reception

Corporate Representatives for Ethical Wikipedia Engagement
Phil Gomes, senior vice-president of a PR firm named Edelman Digital, created a Facebook group called "Corporate Representatives for Ethical Wikipedia Engagement" (CREWE) in January 2012. [123] According to Gerard F. Corbett, CEO of the Public Relations Society of America, CREWE is based on four principles: 1) Corporate communicators want to do the right thing; 2) communicators engaged in ethical practice have a lot to contribute; 3) current Wikipedia policy does not fully understand numbers 1 and 2, because of the activities of some bad actors and a misunderstanding of public relations; and 4) accurate Wikipedia entries are in the public interest. [124]
CREWE lobbies for greater involvement by PR professionals on the site, with the stated goal of maintaining accurate articles about corporations. Some Wikipedia editors, including Jimmy Wales, joined the group to discuss these issues. [125] In an open letter to Wales, Gomes argued that Wikipedia's prominence as a top search result adds a level of responsibility to be accurate. Gomes also criticized alleged inaccurate or outdated articles and the lack of timely response to issues raised in existing channels. He further argued that allowing PR representatives to fix minor errors, such as spelling, grammar and facts, leaves too much ambiguity about what are acceptable changes to make. He made the comparison between PR editors and activists, challenging that activists seem to enjoy "much more latitude," and argued that in certain situations direct editing of articles by PR reps was called for. [126]

PRSA and CIPR
Gerald Corbett, head of the Public Relations Society of America (PRSA) argued in June 2012 for greater access to Wikipedia for PR reps. [127] The Chartered Institute of Public Relations (CIPR) in the UK began to collaborate with the regional Wikimedia UK chapter (WMUK) to provide guidance for CIPR members on how to interact with the Wikipedia community. [128] Jane Wilson, CIPR CEO, said: "For the time being, we may have to start with an acceptance that Wikipedians have a problem with our profession and this reputation has unfortunately been earned. We can't change this overnight but by working in partnership with Wikimedia UK and Wikipedians, through outreach, diplomacy and dialogue, we can make a difference." [73]

International Association of Business Communicators
The International Association of Business Communicators (IABC) devoted their September 2012 CW Bulletin to paid editing on Wikipedia. [129] PR pro Mark Estes said that: "As an advocate, a public relations professional is accountable to his or her client or organization. As a voice of social conscience, however, a public relations professional is accountable to the public at large. Thus, the innate conflict between the two identities. The theory of responsible advocacy attempts to reconcile that conflict and provide guidance to achieve common ground. [130] PR professional David King recommended "collaborating with nothing to hide," emphasizing transparency and the importance of not editing articles directly. He explained: "When legal and marketing departments establish their corporate Wikipedia strategy or policy, they often feel they are faced with only two choices: Ignore one of the world’s most influential websites with a hands-off policy or engage in the risky, controversial and ethically ambiguous practice of direct editing. In some circumstances these are both good strategies, but most companies can find more effective middle ground by engaging in PR or content marketing with Wikipedia’s citizen journalists—a safe and ethical way to make improvements that is valuable both for the organization and Wikipedia. [131]

WikiProject Cooperation and WikiProject Integrity
On 6 January 2012, a Wikipedian created WikiProject Integrity (formerly WikiProject Paid Advocacy Watch). [132] The goal of this Wikiproject is to "discuss, raise awareness of, and hopefully address issues regarding paid editing on Wikipedia, in which people are compensated to create and edit Wikipedia articles." [133]
Days later, on 10 January, another editor created WikiProject Cooperation ; the project page says that it "facilitates collaboration with editors paid to edit Wikipedia." [134] The group is made up of both paid and volunteer Wikipedia editors. [134] The group provides "education and outreach to public relations and marketing professionals, freelance editors, and employees working on assignments from their employers" with the goal of "support[ing] ethical, transparent paid editors that opt-in to collaborative efforts to meet Wikipedia's encyclopedic goals, serve the public's interest and avoid even the perception of impropriety." The main avenue for accomplishing its goals is a paid editor help page, where paid editors and representatives can requests changes to an article and have it reviewed by an experienced editor. [135] WikiProject Cooperation echoes the COI guideline in strongly discouraging paid editors from making direct edits to articles. [134]

2014 statement by 11 PR firms
In June 2014, 11 major public relations companies signed a statement agreeing to comply with Wikipedia's policies on conflict-of-interest editing. [136]

Academy (educational institution)
Academy is a type of secondary or tertiary education institutions.

Etymology
The word comes from the Academy in ancient Greece , which derives from the Athenian hero , Akademos . Outside the city walls of Athens , the gymnasium was made famous by Plato as a center of learning. The sacred space, dedicated to the goddess of wisdom, Athena , had formerly been an olive grove , hence the expression "the groves of Academe." [1]
In these gardens, the philosopher Plato conversed with followers. Plato developed his sessions into a method of teaching philosophy and in 387 BC, established what is known today as the Old Academy .
By extension academia has come to mean the cultural accumulation of knowledge , its development and transmission across generations and its practitioners and transmitters. In the 17th century, British , Italian and French scholars used the term to describe types of institutions of higher learning.

History

Ancient world

Greece and early Europe
In ancient Greece, after the establishment of the original Academy, Plato 's colleagues and pupils developed spin-offs of his method. Arcesilaus , a Greek student of Plato established the Middle Academy . Carneades , another student, established the New Academy . In 335 BC, Aristotle refined the method with his own theories and established the Lyceum in another gymnasium.

Africa
The library of Alexandria in Egypt was frequented by intellectuals from Africa, Europe and Asia studying various aspects of philosophy, language and mathematics.
The University of Timbuktu was a medieval university in Timbuktu , present-day Mali , which comprised three schools: the Mosque of Djinguereber, the Mosque of Sidi Yahya, and the Mosque of Sankore. During its zenith, the university had an average attendance of around 25,000 students within a city of around 100,000 people.

China
In China a higher education institution Shang Xiang was founded by Shun in the Youyu era before the 21st century BC. The Imperial Central Academy at Nanjing , founded in 258, was a result of the evolution of Shang Xiang and it became the first comprehensive institution combining education and research and was divided into five faculties in 470, which later became Nanjing University .
In the 8th century another kind of institution of learning emerged, named Shuyuan , which were generally privately owned. There were thousands of Shuyuan recorded in ancient times. The degrees from them varied from one to another and those advanced Shuyuan such as Bailudong Shuyuan and Yuelu Shuyuan can be classified as higher institutions of learning.

India
Taxila or Takshashila, in ancient India , modern-day Pakistan , was an early Buddhist centre of learning, near present-day Islamabad in the city of Taxila . It is considered as one of the ancient universities of the world. According to scattered references which were only fixed a millennium later it may have dated back to at least the 5th century BC. [2] Some scholars date Takshashila's existence back to the 6th century BC. [3] The school consisted of several monasteries without large dormitories or lecture halls where the religious instruction was most likely still provided on an individualistic basis. [4] Takshashila is described in some detail in later Jātaka tales, written in Sri Lanka around the 5th century AD. [5]
It became a noted centre of learning at least several centuries BC, and continued to attract students until the destruction of the city in the 5th century AD. Takshashila is perhaps best known because of its association with Chanakya. The famous treatise Arthashastra ( Sanskrit for The knowledge of Economics ) by Chanakya, is said to have been composed in Takshashila itself. Chanakya (or Kautilya), [6] the Maurya Emperor Chandragupta [7] and the Ayurvedic healer Charaka studied at Taxila. [8]
Generally, a student entered Takshashila at the age of sixteen. The Vedas and the Eighteen Arts , which included skills such as archery , hunting , and elephant lore, were taught, in addition to its law school , medical school , and school of military science . [8]
Nalanda was established in the 5th century AD in Bihar , India . [11] It was founded in 427 in northeastern India, not far from what is today the southern border of Nepal. It survived until 1197 when it was set upon, destroyed and burnt by the marauding forces of Ikhtiyar Uddin Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khilji . It was devoted to Buddhist studies, but it also trained students in fine arts, medicine, mathematics, astronomy, politics and the art of war. [12]
The center had eight separate compounds, 10 temples, meditation halls, classrooms, lakes and parks. It had a nine-story library where monks meticulously copied books and documents so that individual scholars could have their own collections. It had dormitories for students, perhaps a first for an educational institution, housing 10,000 students in the university’s heyday and providing accommodation for 2,000 professors. [13] Nalanda University attracted pupils and scholars from Korea, Japan, China, Tibet, Indonesia, Persia and Turkey.

Islamic world
Founded in Fes , University of Al-Karaouine in the 9th century and in Cairo , Al-Azhar University in the 10th century, and in Mali , the University of Timbuktu in about 1100. Mustansiriya Madrasah in Baghdad , Iraq was established in 1227 as a madrasah by the Abbasid Caliph al-Mustansir . Its library had an initial collection of 80,000 volumes, given by the Caliph. The collection was said to have grown to 400,000 volumes.

Medieval Europe
In Europe , the academy dates to the ancient Greeks and Romans in the pre-Christian era. Newer universities were founded in the 12th and 13th centuries, and the European institution of academia took shape. Monks and priests moved out of monasteries to cathedral cities and other towns where they opened the first schools dedicated to advanced study.
The most notable of these new schools were in Bologna , Paris , Oxford and Cambridge , while others were opened throughout Europe.
The seven liberal arts — the Trivium ( Grammar , Rhetoric , and Logic ), and the Quadrivium ( Arithmetic , Geometry , Music , and Astronomy ) — had been codified in late antiquity . This was the basis of the curriculum in Europe until newly available Arabic texts and the works of Aristotle became more available in Europe in the 12th century.
It remained in place even after the new scholasticism of the School of Chartres and the encyclopedic work of Thomas Aquinas , until the humanism of the 15th and 16th centuries opened new studies of arts and sciences.

Academic societies
Academic societies or learned societies began as groups of academics who worked together or presented their work to each other. These informal groups later became organized and in many cases state-approved. Membership was restricted, usually requiring approval of the current members and often total membership was limited to a specific number. The Royal Society founded in 1660 was the first such academy. The American Academy of Arts and Sciences was begun in 1780 by many of the same people prominent in the American Revolution . Academic societies served both as a forum to present and publish academic work, the role now served by academic publishing, and as a means to sponsor research and support academics, a role they still serve. Membership in academic societies is still a matter of prestige in modern academia.

Eighteenth and nineteenth centuries
Academia began to splinter from its Christian roots in 18th-century colonial America . In 1753, Benjamin Franklin established the Academy and Charitable School of the Province of Pennsylvania. In 1755, it was renamed the College and Academy and Charitable School of Philadelphia. Today, it is known as the University of Pennsylvania . For the first time, academia was established as a secular institution. For the most part, church-based dogmatic points of view were no longer thrust upon students in the examination of their subjects of study. Points of view became more varied as students were free to wander in thought without having to add religious dimensions to their conclusions.
In 1819, Thomas Jefferson founded the University of Virginia and developed the standards used today in organizing colleges and universities across the globe. The curriculum was taken from the traditional liberal arts, classical humanism and the values introduced with the Protestant Reformation . Jefferson offered his students something new: the freedom to chart their own courses of study rather than mandate a fixed curriculum for all students. Religious colleges and universities followed suit.
The Academy movement in the U.S. in the early 19th century arose from a public sense that education in the classic disciplines needed to be extended into the new territories and states that were being formed in the Old Northwest , in western New York State , Pennsylvania , Ohio , Michigan , Indiana and Illinois . Dozens of academies were founded in the area, supported by private donations.
During the Age of Enlightenment in 18th-century Europe, the academy started to change in Europe. In the beginning of the 19th century Wilhelm von Humboldt not only published his philosophical paper On the Limits of State Action , but also directed the educational system in Prussia for a short time. He introduced an academic system that was much more accessible to the lower classes. Humboldt's Ideal was an education based on individuality, creativity, wholeness, and versatility. Many continental European universities are still rooted in these ideas (or at least pay lip-service to them). They are, however, in contradiction to today's massive trend of specialization in academia.

Academic personnel
An academic is a person who works as a teacher or researcher at a university or other higher education institution. An academic usually holds an advanced degree . The term scholar is sometimes used with equivalent meaning to that of academic and describes in general those who attain mastery in a research discipline. It has wider application, with it also being used to describe those whose occupation was researched prior to organized higher education.
Academic administrators such as university presidents are not typically included in this use of the term academic , although many administrators hold advanced degrees and pursue scholarly research and writing while also tending to their administrative duties.
In the United States , the term academic is approximately synonymous with that of the job title professor although in recent decades a growing number of institutions include librarians in the category of "academic staff." In the United Kingdom , various titles of academic rank are used, typically research associate , research fellow (also senior research fellow and principal research fellow), lecturer (also senior lecturer and principal lecturer), reader , and professor . The colloquial term don is sometimes substituted for teaching staff at Oxford and Cambridge.

Structure
Academia is usually conceived of as divided into disciplines or fields of study. These have their roots in the subjects of the medieval trivium and quadrivium , which provided the model for scholastic thought in the first universities in medieval Europe .
The disciplines have been much revised, and many new disciplines have become more specialized, researching smaller and smaller areas. Because of this, interdisciplinary research is often prized in today's academy, though it can also be made difficult both by practical matters of administration and funding and by differing research methods of different disciplines. In fact, many new fields of study have initially been conceived as interdisciplinary, and later become specialized disciplines in their own right - a recent example is cognitive science .
Most academic institutions reflect the divide of the disciplines in their administrative structure, being divided internally into departments or programs in various fields of study. Each department is typically administered and funded separately by the academic institution, though there may be some overlap and faculty members, research and administrative staff may in some cases be shared among departments. In addition, academic institutions generally have an overall administrative structure (usually including a president and several deans ) which is controlled by no single department, discipline, or field of thought. Also, the tenure system, a major component of academic employment and research in the US, serves to ensure that academia is relatively protected from political and financial pressures on thought.

Qualifications
The degree awarded for completed study is the primary academic qualification. Typically these are, in order of completion, associate's degree , bachelor's degree (awarded for completion of undergraduate study), master's degree , and doctorate (awarded after graduate or postgraduate study). These are only currently being standardized in Europe as part of the Bologna process , as many different degrees and standards of time to reach each are currently awarded in different countries in Europe. In most fields the majority of academic researchers and teachers have doctorates or other terminal degrees, though in some professional and creative fields it is common for scholars and teachers to have only master's degrees.

Academic conferences
Closely related to academic publishing is the practice of bringing a number of intellectuals in a field to give talks on their research at an academic conference, often allowing for a wider audience to be exposed to their ideas.

Conflicting goals
Within academia, diverse constituent groups have diverse, and sometimes conflicting, goals. In the contemporary academy several of these conflicts are widely distributed and common. A salient example of conflict is that between the goal to improve teaching quality and the goal to reduce costs. The conflicting goals of professional education programs and general education advocates currently are playing out in the negotiation over accreditation standards.

Practice and theory
Putting theory into practice can result in a gap between what is learned in academic settings and how that learning is manifested in practical settings. This is addressed in a number of professional schools such as education and social work , which require students to participate in practica for credit. Students are taught to bridge the gap between theory and practice.
Not everyone agrees on the value of theory as opposed to practice. Academics are sometimes criticized as lacking practical experience and thus too insulated from the 'real world.' Academic insularity is colloquially criticized as being " ivory tower "; when used pejoratively, this term is criticized as anti-intellectualism .
To address this split, there is a growing body of practice research , such as the practice-based research network (PBRN) within clinical medical research . Arts and humanities departments debate how to define this emerging research phenomenon. There are a variety of contested models of practice research (practice-as-research, practice-based and practice through research), for example, screen media practice research .

Town and gown
Universities are often culturally distinct from the towns or cities where they reside. In some cases this leads to discomfort or outright conflict between local residents and members of the university over political, economic, or other issues. Some localities in the Northeastern United States, for instance, have tried to block students from registering to vote as local residents—instead encouraging them to vote by absentee ballot at their primary residence—in order to retain control of local politics. [ citation needed ] Other issues can include deep cultural and class divisions between local residents and university students. The film Breaking Away dramatizes such a conflict.

Commerce and scholarship
The goals of research for profit and for the sake of knowledge often conflict to some degree. [ citation needed ]

Academic publishing

History of academic journals
Among the earliest research journals were the Proceedings of Meetings of the Royal Society in the 17th Century. At that time, the act of publishing academic inquiry was controversial, and widely ridiculed. It was not at all unusual for a new discovery to be announced as an anagram , reserving priority for the discoverer, but indecipherable for anyone not in on the secret: both Isaac Newton and Leibniz used this approach. However, this method did not work well. Robert K. Merton , a sociologist, found that 92 percent of cases of simultaneous discovery in the 17th century ended in dispute. The number of disputes dropped to 72 percent in the 18th century, 59 percent by the latter half of the 19th century, and 33 percent by the first half of the 20th century. The decline in contested claims for priority in research discoveries can be credited to the increasing acceptance of the publication of papers in modern academic journals.
The Royal Society was steadfast in its unpopular belief that science could only move forward through a transparent and open exchange of ideas backed by experimental evidence. Many of the experiments were ones that we would not recognize as scientific today—nor were the questions they answered. For example, when the Duke of Buckingham was admitted as a Fellow of the Royal Society on June 5, 1661, he presented the Society with a vial of powdered " unicorn horn". It was a well-accepted 'fact' that a circle of unicorn's horn would act as an invisible cage for any spider . Robert Hooke , the chief experimenter of the Royal Society, emptied the Duke's vial into a circle on a table and dropped a spider in the centre of the circle. The spider promptly walked out of the circle and off the table. In its day, this was cutting-edge research.

Current status and development
Research journals have been so successful that the number of journals and of papers has proliferated over the past few decades, and the credo of the modern academic has become " publish or perish ". Except for generalist journals such as Science or Nature , the topics covered in any single journal have tended to be narrow, and readership and citation have declined. A variety of methods for reviewing submissions exist. The most common involves initial approval by the journal, peer review by two or three researchers working in similar or closely related subjects who recommend approval or rejection as well as request error correction, clarification or additions before publishing. Controversial topics may receive additional levels of review. Journals have developed a hierarchy, partly based on reputation but also on the strictness of the review policy. More prestigious journals are more likely to receive and publish more important work. Submitters try to submit their work to the most prestigious journal likely to publish it to bolster their reputation and curriculum vitae .
Andrew Odlyzko , an academician with a large number of published research papers, has argued that research journals will evolve into something akin to Internet forums over the coming decade, by extending the interactivity of current Internet preprints . This change may open them up to a wider range of ideas, some more developed than others. Whether this will be a positive evolution remains to be seen. Some claim that forums, like markets, tend to thrive or fail based on their ability to attract talent. Some believe that highly restrictive and tightly monitored forums may be the least likely to thrive.

Academic dress
Gowns have been associated with academia since the birth of the university in the 14th and 15th centuries, perhaps because most early scholars were priests or church officials. Over time, the gowns worn by degree-holders have become standardized to some extent, although traditions in individual countries and even institutions have established a diverse range of gown styles, and some have ended the custom entirely, even for graduation ceremonies.
At some universities, such as the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge , undergraduates may be required to wear gowns on formal occasions and on graduation. Undergraduate gowns are usually a shortened version of a bachelor's gown. At other universities, for example, outside the UK or U.S., the custom is entirely absent. Students at the University of Trinity College at the University of Toronto wear gowns to formal dinner, debates, to student government, and to many other places.
In general, in the U.S. and UK recipients of a bachelor's degree are entitled to wear a simple full-length robe without adornment and a mortarboard cap with a tassel. In addition, holders of a bachelor's degree may be entitled to wear a ceremonial hood at some schools. In the U.S., bachelor's hoods are rarely seen. Bachelor's hoods are generally smaller versions of those worn by recipients of master's and doctoral degrees.
Recipients of a master's degree in the U.S. or UK wear a similar cap and gown but closed sleeves with slits, and usually receive a ceremonial hood that hangs down the back of the gown. In the U.S. the hood is traditionally edged with a silk or velvet strip displaying the disciplinary color, and is lined with the university's colors.
According to The American Council on Education “six-year specialist degrees ( Ed.S. , etc.) and other degrees that are intermediate between the master's and the doctor's degree may have hoods specially designed (1) intermediate in length between the master's and doctor's hood, (2) with a four-inch velvet border (also intermediate between the widths of the borders of master's and doctor's hoods), and (3) with color distributed in the usual fashion and according to the usual rules. Cap tassels should be uniformly black.” [14]
Recipients of a doctoral degree tend to have the most elaborate academic dress, and hence there is the greatest diversity at this level. In the U.S., doctoral gowns are similar to the gowns worn by master's graduates, with the addition of velvet stripes across the sleeves and running down the front of the gown which may be tinted with the disciplinary color for the degree received. Holders of a doctoral degree may be entitled or obliged to wear scarlet (a special gown in scarlet) on high days and special occasions. While some doctoral graduates wear the mortarboard cap traditional to the lower degree levels, most wear a cap or Tudor bonnet that resembles a tam o'shanter , from which a colored tassel is suspended.
In modern times in the U.S. and UK, gowns are normally only worn at graduation ceremonies, although some colleges still demand the wearing of academic dress on formal occasions (official banquets and other similar affairs). In the 19th and early 20th centuries, it was more common to see the dress worn in the classroom, a practice which has now all but disappeared. Two notable exceptions are Oxford and a society at Sewanee , where students are required to wear formal academic dress in the examination room.

Syllabus
A syllabus (pl. syllabuses [1] or syllabi [2] ) is an academic document that communicates course information and defines expectations and responsibilities. It is descriptive (unlike the prescriptive or specific curriculum ). A syllabus may be set out by an exam board or prepared by the professor who supervises or controls course quality. It may be provided in paper form or online.
There are seven essential components to an academic syllabus: Instructor information, General course information, Course objectives, Course policies, Grading and evaluation, Learning resources, and the Course Calendar.

Definition
The syllabus is a "contract between faculty members and their students, designed to answer students' questions about a course, as well as inform them about what will happen should they fail to meet course expectations." [3] It is also a "vehicle for expressing accountability and commitment" (2005, p. 63). [4] Over time, the notion of a syllabus as a contract has grown more literal but is not in fact an enforceable contract. [5]

Etymology
According to the Oxford English Dictionary , the word syllabus derives from modern Latin syllabus "list", in turn from a misreading of the Greek σίττυβας sittybas "parchment label, table of contents", which first occurred in a 15th-century print of Cicero 's letters to Atticus. [1] [6] Earlier Latin dictionaries such as Lewis and Short contain the word syllabus , [7] relating it to the non-existent Greek word σύλλαβος, which appears to be a mistaken reading of syllaba "syllable"; the newer Oxford Latin Dictionary does not contain this word. [8] The apparent change from sitty- to sylla- is explained as a hypercorrection by analogy to συλλαμβάνω ( syllambano "bring together, gather"). [8]
Because the word syllabus is formed in Latin by mistake, the Latinate plural form syllabi might be considered a hypercorrection. [9] The OED, however, admits both syllabuses and syllabi as the plural form. [1]

Purpose
The syllabus ensures a fair and impartial understanding between the instructor and students such that there is minimal confusion on policies relating to the course, setting clear expectations of material to be learned, behavior in the classroom, and effort on student's behalf to be put into the course, providing a roadmap of course organization/direction relaying the instructor's teaching philosophy to the students, and providing a marketing angle of the course such that students may choose early in the course whether the subject material is attractive.
Many generalized items of a syllabus can be amplified in a specific curriculum to maximize efficient learning by clarifying student understanding of specified material such as grading policy, grading rubric, late work policy, locations and times, other contact information for instructor and teaching assistant such as phone or email, materials required and/or recommended such as textbooks, assigned reading books, calculators (or other equipment), lab vouchers, etc., outside resources for subject material assistance (extracurricular books, tutor locations, resource centers, etc.), important dates in course such as exams and paper due-dates, tips for succeeding in mastering course content such as study habits and expected time allotment, suggested problems if applicable, necessary pre-requisites or co-requisites to current course, safety rules if appropriate, and objectives of the course.
A syllabus will often contain a reading list of relevant books and articles that are compulsory or optional for students to read. As an indirect effect of this, scholars can count how many online syllabi include their works as a way of estimating their educational impact. [10]

Health information on Wikipedia
The online encyclopedia Wikipedia has, since the late 2000s, served as a popular source for health information for both laypersons and, in many cases, health care practitioners. Health-related articles on Wikipedia are popularly accessed as results from search engines , which frequently deliver links to Wikipedia articles. [1] Independent assessments have been made of the number and demographics of people who seek health information on Wikipedia , the scope of health information on Wikipedia, and the quality of the information on Wikipedia. [2]
The English-language Wikipedia was estimated in 2014 to hold around 25,000 articles on health-related topics. [3] Across Wikipedia encyclopedias in all languages there were 155,000 health articles using 950,000 citations to sources and which collectively received 4.8 billion pageviews in 2013. [4] This amount of traffic makes Wikipedia one of the most consulted health resources in the world, or perhaps the most consulted resource. [4]

Accuracy and usefulness of content

Academic studies
A 2007 study examined a sample of Wikipedia pages about the most frequently performed surgical procedures in the United States, and found that 85.7% of them were appropriate for patients and that these articles had "a remarkably high level of internal validity". [5] However, the same study also raised concerns about Wikipedia's completeness, noting that only 62.9% of the articles examined were free of "critical omissions". [5]
A 2008 study reported that drug information on Wikipedia "has a more narrow scope, is less complete, and has more errors of omission" than did such information on the traditionally edited online database Medscape Drug Reference . [6]
A 2011 assessment of 50 medical articles on Wikipedia found that 56% of the references cited on these pages could be considered reputable, and that each entry contained 29 reputable sources on average. [7]
A 2011 study examined Wikipedia pages about five statins , and concluded that these pages did not contain incorrect or misleading information, but that they were often missing information about drug interactions and contraindications to use. [8]
Another 2011 study examining Wikipedia articles on the 20 most widely prescribed drugs found that seven of these articles did not have any references, and concluded that "Wikipedia does not provide consistently accurate, complete, and referenced medication information." [9]
An assessment of Wikipedia articles in 2012 on dietary supplements found that Wikipedia articles were "frequently incomplete, of variable quality, and sometimes inconsistent with reputable sources of information on these products." [10]
A 2013 review of nephrology content on Wikipedia found it to be "a comprehensive and fairly reliable medical resource for nephrology patients that is written at a college reading level". [11]
A 2013 scoping review published in the Journal of Medical Internet Research summarized the existing evidence about the use of wikis, Wikipedia and other collaborative writing applications in health care and found that the available research publications were observational reports rather than the primary research studies which would be necessary to begin drawing conclusions. [12]
A 2014 study that examined 97 Wikipedia articles about complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) found that 4% of them had attained "Good article" status, and that CAM articles on Wikipedia tended to be significantly shorter than those about conventional therapies. [13]
In May 2014 the The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association published an article which concluded that "Most Wikipedia articles for the 10 costliest conditions in the United States contain errors compared with standard peer-reviewed sources." [14] [15] Following this paper, many other media sources reported that readers should not trust Wikipedia for medical information. [16] [17] [18] [19] Wikipedia's contributors to its health content defended Wikipedia and criticized this study, [20] as the research is considered severely flawed including basic methodological flaws like the conclusions are not supported by the data provided. [21]
A 2014 study found that when the FDA issues new safety warnings about drugs, in 41% of cases reviewed Wikipedia articles about those drugs were updated to give the new safety information within two weeks. [22] Another 23% of Wikipedia drug articles were updated to give this information within an average of about 40 days, but 36% of articles are not updated with this information within a year. [22]
A 2014 comparison between selected drug information from pharmacology textbooks and comparable information on the English-language and German-language Wikipedias found that the drug information in Wikipedia covers most of what is essential for undergraduate pharmacology studies and that it is accurate. [23]
The readability of Wikipedia's articles for epilepsy and Parkinson's disease was critiqued and found to be difficult to read. [24] [25] Another study found that Wikipedia's information about neurological diseases was significantly more difficult to read than the information in the American Academy of Neurology 's patient brochures, the Mayo Clinic 's website, or MedlinePlus . [26] Another 2015 study, this one authored by Samy Azer , reported that Wikipedia should not be used to learn about concepts related to pulmonology students. [27] Another 2015 study by Azer found that Wikipedia entries about cardiovascular diseases were "not aimed at a medical audience" and were mainly inaccurate due to errors of omission. [28]
A 2016 study found that Wikipedia information about common internal medicine diagnoses was written at a higher grade level than any of the four other sites studied (NIH, WebMD, Mayo Clinic, and "diagnosis-specific websites"). [29] In contrast, another study published the same year found that medical students reading about three unstudied diseases on AccessMedicine and Wikipedia experienced less mental effort than did readers of the same diseases on UpToDate . [30]
A 2016 study found that drug information on Wikipedia was less accurate and complete than that on the medical reference site Micromedex . [31]
A 2017 study compared the accuracy of Wikipedia articles about the 33 most popular medications with medication guides to the accuracy of their medication guides. The study found that the Wikipedia articles were generally less accurate than were the corresponding medication guides. [32]

Other views
Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales has said that lack of health information increases preventable deaths in emerging markets and that health information from Wikipedia can improve community health. [33] Wales presented the Wikipedia Zero project as a channel for delivering health information into places where people have difficulty accessing online information. [33]
As a result of public interest in the 2014 Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa , Wikipedia became a popular source of information on Ebola . [34] Doctors who were Wikipedia contributors said that Wikipedia's quality made it useful. [34]

Alternative medicine
People who promote alternative medicine have complained that Wikipedia negatively portrays holistic health treatments including energy medicine , Emotional Freedom Techniques , Thought Field Therapy and Tapas Acupressure Technique . [35] In response, Wales has stated, "If you can get your work published in respectable scientific journals – that is to say, if you can produce evidence through replicable scientific experiments, then Wikipedia will cover it appropriately." [35] [36] [37] Similar concerns have been raised regarding its coverage of homeopathy . [38]
Wikipedia policy for articles that "could reasonably be perceived as relating to human health" comes under the policy for medicine-related articles which is science -based.

Extent of usage
The majority of people in the United States use the internet as a source of health information. [39] One 2013 study suggested that 22% of healthcare searches online direct users to Wikipedia. [40]
Wikipedia was described in 2014 as "the leading single source of healthcare information for patients and healthcare professionals". [41] A study of a particular group of veterinary students found that the majority of these students sought and found medical information on Wikipedia. [42] Some doctors have described their use of Wikipedia as a "guilty secret". [43]
Wikipedia's health information has been described as "transforming how our next doctors learn medicine". [44] Various commentators in health education have said that Wikipedia is popular among medical students. [45] [46]

Academic citations
Wikipedia has been inappropriately cited as an authoritative source in many health science journals. [47] [48]

Impact on psychological tests
In 2009 a doctor and Wikipedia editor, James Heilman , incorporated public domain images of the Rorschach test into Wikipedia. [49] Psychologists complained that the increased public exposure to these tests devalued their clinical utility, and that public health was harmed as a result. [49]

Nature of contributors
A 2014 interview study found that around half of the editors of health-related content on the English-language Wikipedia are health care professionals, while the other half includes some medical students. [3] An author of this study wrote that this provides "reassurance about the reliability of the website". [3] The study also found that the "core editor community", who actively monitor and edit most health-related articles on the English-language Wikipedia, numbered around 300 people. [50] The study found that people who contribute on these topics do so for a variety of reasons, including a desire to better learn the subjects themselves, and a sense of both responsibility and enjoyment in improving others' access to health information. [50]

Usage of traffic statistics in health monitoring
Just as Google Flu Trends was able to correlate searches for flu to local outbreaks of flu , page views of Wikipedia articles on flu-related topics have been found to increase in populations experiencing the spread of flu, [51] [52] and of other diseases such as dengue fever and tuberculosis . [53] [54]

Projects to improve health information on Wikipedia
In 2009 the National Institutes of Health attempted a pilot project for integrating health information into Wikipedia. [55] In 2011, it was reported that Cancer Research UK had started a program whereby some of its staff would edit Wikipedia's cancer-related articles. [56]
The University of California, San Francisco has a program for encouraging students to contribute health content to Wikipedia. [57]
In response to studies showing that the majority of patients and providers use the Internet to find health information, [58] [59] the Maternal and Child Health (MCH) Library developed a New Media Primer to increase the skills of health care providers in using social media to share information on public health. [60] A 2012 article from Children’s Hospital of Eastern Ontario described the development of a disease-specific primer for providers and patients guiding both to the highest quality and most reliable new media sites.

American Civil War
The American Civil War was fought in the United States from 1861 to 1865. After a long standing controversy over slavery and state's rights , war broke out in April, 1861, when Confederates attacked Fort Sumter in South Carolina , shortly after Abraham Lincoln was elected. The Union faced secessionists in eleven Southern states grouped together as the Confederate States of America . The Union won the war, which remains the bloodiest in U.S. history .
Among the 34 U.S. states in February 1861, seven Southern slave states individually declared their secession from the U.S. to form the Confederate States of America. The Confederacy grew to include eleven states; it claimed two more border states ( Kentucky and Missouri ), the Indian Territory , and the southern portions of the western territories of Arizona and New Mexico , which was organized and incorporated into the Confederacy as Confederate Arizona . The Confederacy was never diplomatically recognized by the United States government , nor was it recognized by any foreign country (although some countries such as Britain and France recognized it as a belligerent power ). The states that remained loyal, including the border states where slavery was legal, were known as the Union or the North . The war ended with the surrender of all the Confederate armies and the dissolution of the Confederate government in the spring of 1865.
The Union won the war when General Robert E. Lee surrendered to General Ulysses S. Grant at battle of Appomattox . Four years of intense combat left 620,000 to 750,000 soldiers dead, a higher number than the number of American military deaths in World War I and World War II combined, and much of the South's infrastructure was destroyed. The Confederacy collapsed and 4 million slaves were freed (most of them by Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation ). The Reconstruction Era (1863–1877) overlapped and followed the war, with the process of restoring national unity, strengthening the national government, and granting civil rights to freed slaves throughout the country.

History
In the 1860 presidential election , Republicans , led by Abraham Lincoln , supported banning slavery in all the U.S. territories at the time, something which the Southern states viewed as a violation of their constitutional rights and as being part of a plan to eventually abolish slavery. The three pro-Union candidates together received an overwhelming 82% majority of the votes cast nationally: Republican Lincoln's votes centered in the north, Democrat Stephen A. Douglas ' votes were distributed nationally and Constitutional Unionist John Bell 's votes centered in Tennessee , Kentucky , and Virginia . The Republican Party, dominant in the North, secured a plurality of the popular votes and a majority of the electoral votes nationally, so Lincoln was constitutionally elected the first Republican president.
But before his inauguration , seven slave states with cotton -based economies formed the Confederacy. The first six to declare secession had the highest proportions of slaves in their populations, a total of 49 percent. [16] The first seven with state legislatures to resolve for secession included split majorities for unionists Douglas and Bell in Georgia with 51% and Louisiana with 55%. Alabama had voted 46% for those unionists, Mississippi with 40%, Florida with 38%, Texas with 25%, and South Carolina cast Electoral College votes without a popular vote for president. [17] Of these, only Texas held a referendum on secession.
Eight remaining slave states continued to reject calls for secession. Outgoing Democratic President James Buchanan and the incoming Republicans rejected secession as illegal. Lincoln's March 4, 1861, inaugural address declared that his administration would not initiate a civil war . Speaking directly to the "Southern States," he reaffirmed, "I have no purpose, directly or indirectly to interfere with the institution of slavery in the United States where it exists. I believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so." [18] After Confederate forces seized numerous federal forts within territory claimed by the Confederacy, efforts at compromise failed and both sides prepared for war. The Confederates assumed that European countries were so dependent on " King Cotton " that they would intervene, but none did, and none recognized the new Confederate States of America.
Hostilities began on April 12, 1861, when Confederate forces fired upon Fort Sumter . While in the Western Theater the Union made significant permanent gains, in the Eastern Theater , the battle was inconclusive in 1861–62. The autumn 1862 Confederate campaigns into Maryland and Kentucky failed, dissuading British intervention. [ citation needed ] Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation , which made ending slavery a war goal. [19] To the west, by summer 1862 the Union destroyed the Confederate river navy, then much of their western armies, and seized New Orleans . The 1863 Union Siege of Vicksburg split the Confederacy in two at the Mississippi River . In 1863, Robert E. Lee 's Confederate incursion north ended at the Battle of Gettysburg . Western successes led to Ulysses S. Grant 's command of all Union armies in 1864. Inflicting an ever-tightening naval blockade of Confederate ports, the Union marshaled the resources and manpower to attack the Confederacy from all directions, leading to the fall of Atlanta to William T. Sherman and his march to the sea . The last significant battles raged around the Siege of Petersburg . Lee's escape attempt ended with his surrender at Appomattox Court House , on April 9, 1865. While the military war was coming to an end, the political reintegration of the nation was to take another 12 years of the Reconstruction Era .
The American Civil War was one of the earliest true industrial wars . Railroads, the telegraph, steamships, and mass-produced weapons were employed extensively. The mobilization of civilian factories, mines, shipyards, banks, transportation and food supplies all foreshadowed the impact of industrialization in World War I . It remains the deadliest war in American history . From 1861 to 1865, it has been traditionally estimated that about 620,000 died but recent scholarship argues that 750,000 soldiers died, [20] along with an undetermined number of civilians . [N 1] By one estimate, the war claimed the lives of 10 percent of all Northern males 20–45 years old, and 30 percent of all Southern white males aged 18–40. [22]

Causes of secession
The causes of the Civil War were complex and have been controversial since the war began. James C. Bradford wrote that the issue has been further complicated by historical revisionists , who have tried to offer a variety of reasons for the war. [23] Slavery was the central source of escalating political tension in the 1850s. The Republican Party was determined to prevent any spread of slavery, and many Southern leaders had threatened secession if the Republican candidate, Lincoln , won the 1860 election . After Lincoln won without carrying a single Southern state, many Southern whites felt that disunion had become their only option, because they thought that they were losing representation, which would hamper their ability to promote pro-slavery acts and policies. [24] [25]

Root causes

Slavery
Contemporary actors, the Union and Confederate leadership and the fighting soldiers on both sides believed that slavery caused the Civil War. Union men mainly believed that the purpose of the war was to emancipate the slaves. Confederates fought the war in order to protect southern society, and slavery was an integral part of it. [26] From the anti-slavery perspective, the issue was primarily about whether the system of slavery was an anachronistic evil that was incompatible with Republicanism in the United States . The strategy of the anti-slavery forces was containment—to stop the expansion and thus put slavery on a path to gradual extinction. [27] The slave-holding interests in the South denounced this strategy as infringing upon their Constitutional rights. [28] Southern whites believed that the emancipation of slaves would destroy the South's economy, due to the large amount of capital invested in slaves and fears of integrating the ex-slave black population. [29]
Slavery was illegal in the North, having been outlawed in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. It was also fading in the border states and in Southern cities, but it was expanding in the highly profitable cotton districts of the South and Southwest. Subsequent writers on the American Civil War looked to several factors explaining the geographic divide, including sectionalism, protectionism, and state's rights.

Sectionalism
Sectionalism refers to the different economies, social structure, customs and political values of the North and South. [30] [31] It increased steadily between 1800 and 1860 as the North, which phased slavery out of existence, industrialized, urbanized, and built prosperous farms, while the deep South concentrated on plantation agriculture based on slave labor, together with subsistence farming for poor freedmen . In the 1840s and 50s, the issue of accepting slavery (in the guise of rejecting slave-owning bishops and missionaries) split the nation's largest religious denominations (the Methodist, Baptist and Presbyterian churches) into separate Northern and Southern denominations. [32]
Historians have debated whether economic differences between the industrial Northeast and the agricultural South helped cause the war. Most historians now disagree with the economic determinism of historian Charles A. Beard in the 1920s and emphasize that Northern and Southern economies were largely complementary. While socially different, the sections economically benefited each other. [33] [34]

Protectionism
Historically, southern slave-holding states, because of their low cost manual labor, had little perceived need for mechanization, and supported having the right to sell cotton and purchase manufactured goods from any nation. Northern states, which had heavily invested in their still-nascent manufacturing, could not compete with the full-fledged industries of Europe in offering high prices for cotton imported from the South and low prices for manufactured exports in return. Thus, northern manufacturing interests supported tariffs and protectionism while southern planters demanded free trade. [35]
The Democrats in Congress, controlled by Southerners, wrote the tariff laws in the 1830s, 1840s, and 1850s, and kept reducing rates so that the 1857 rates were the lowest since 1816. The Whigs and Republicans complained because they favored high tariffs to stimulate industrial growth, and Republicans called for an increase in tariffs in the 1860 election. The increases were only enacted in 1861 after Southerners resigned their seats in Congress. [36] [37] The tariff issue was and is sometimes cited–long after the war–by Lost Cause historians and neo-Confederate apologists. In 1860–61 none of the groups that proposed compromises to head off secession raised the tariff issue. [38] Pamphleteers North and South rarely mentioned the tariff, [39] and when some did, for instance, Matthew Fontaine Maury [40] and John Lothrop Motley , [41] they were generally writing for a foreign audience.

States' rights
The South argued that each state had the right to secede—leave the Union—at any time, that the Constitution was a "compact" or agreement among the states. Northerners (including President Buchanan) rejected that notion as opposed to the will of the Founding Fathers who said they were setting up a perpetual union. [42] Historian James McPherson writes concerning states' rights and other non-slavery explanations:

Territorial crisis
Between 1803 and 1854, the United States achieved a vast expansion of territory through purchase, negotiation, and conquest. At first, the new states carved out of these territories entering the union were apportioned equally between slave and free states. It was over territories west of the Mississippi that the proslavery and antislavery forces collided. [44]
With the conquest of northern Mexico west to California in 1848, slaveholding interests looked forward to expanding into these lands and perhaps Cuba and Central America as well. [45] [46] Northern "free soil" interests vigorously sought to curtail any further expansion of slave territory. The Compromise of 1850 over California balanced a free soil state with stronger fugitive slave laws for a political settlement after four years of strife in the 1840s. But the states admitted following California were all free: Minnesota (1858), Oregon (1859) and Kansas (1861). In the southern states the question of the territorial expansion of slavery westward again became explosive. [47] Both the South and the North drew the same conclusion: "The power to decide the question of slavery for the territories was the power to determine the future of slavery itself." [48] [49]
By 1860, four doctrines had emerged to answer the question of federal control in the territories, and they all claimed they were sanctioned by the Constitution, implicitly or explicitly. [50] The first of these "conservative" theories, represented by the Constitutional Union Party , argued that the Missouri Compromise apportionment of territory north for free soil and south for slavery should become a Constitutional mandate. The Crittenden Compromise of 1860 was an expression of this view. [51]
The second doctrine of Congressional preeminence, championed by Abraham Lincoln and the Republican Party, insisted that the Constitution did not bind legislators to a policy of balance—that slavery could be excluded in a territory as it was done in the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 at the discretion of Congress, [52] thus Congress could restrict human bondage, but never establish it. The Wilmot Proviso announced this position in 1846. [53]
Senator Stephen A. Douglas proclaimed the doctrine of territorial or "popular" sovereignty – which asserted that the settlers in a territory had the same rights as states in the Union to establish or disestablish slavery as a purely local matter. [54] The Kansas–Nebraska Act of 1854 legislated this doctrine. [55] In Kansas Territory, years of pro and anti-slavery violence and political conflict erupted; the congressional House of Representatives voted to admit Kansas as a free state in early 1860, but its admission in the Senate was delayed until January 1861, after the 1860 elections when southern senators began to leave. [56]
The fourth theory was advocated by Mississippi Senator Jefferson Davis , [57] one of state sovereignty ("states' rights"), [58] also known as the "Calhoun doctrine", [59] named after the South Carolinian political theorist and statesman John C. Calhoun . [60] Rejecting the arguments for federal authority or self-government, state sovereignty would empower states to promote the expansion of slavery as part of the Federal Union under the U.S. Constitution. [61] "States' rights" was an ideology formulated and applied as a means of advancing slave state interests through federal authority. [62] As historian Thomas L. Krannawitter points out, the "Southern demand for federal slave protection represented a demand for an unprecedented expansion of federal power." [63] [64] These four doctrines comprised the major ideologies presented to the American public on the matters of slavery, the territories and the U.S. Constitution prior to the 1860 presidential election. [65]

National elections
Beginning in the American Revolution and accelerating after the War of 1812 , the people of the United States grew in the sense that their country was a national republic based on the belief that all people had inalienable political liberty and personal rights which could serve as an important example to the rest of the world. Previous regional independence movements such as the Greek revolt in the Ottoman Empire , the division and redivision of the Latin American political map, and the British-French Crimean triumph leading to an interest in redrawing Europe along cultural differences, all conspired to make for a time of upheaval and uncertainty about the basis of the nation-state. In the world of 19th century self-made Americans, growing in prosperity, population and expanding westward, "freedom" could mean personal liberty or property rights. The unresolved difference would cause failure—first in their political institutions, then in their civil life together.

Nationalism and honor
Nationalism was a powerful force in the early 19th century, with famous spokesmen such as Andrew Jackson and Daniel Webster . While practically all Northerners supported the Union, Southerners were split between those loyal to the entire United States (called "unionists") and those loyal primarily to the southern region and then the Confederacy. [66] C. Vann Woodward said of the latter group,
Perceived insults to Southern collective honor included the enormous popularity of Uncle Tom's Cabin (1852) [68] and the actions of abolitionist John Brown in trying to incite a slave rebellion in 1859. [69]
While the South moved towards a Southern nationalism, leaders in the North were also becoming more nationally minded, and they rejected any notion of splitting the Union. The Republican national electoral platform of 1860 warned that Republicans regarded disunion as treason and would not tolerate it: "We denounce those threats of disunion ... as denying the vital principles of a free government, and as an avowal of contemplated treason, which it is the imperative duty of an indignant people sternly to rebuke and forever silence." [70] The South ignored the warnings: Southerners did not realize how ardently the North would fight to hold the Union together. [71]

Lincoln's election
The election of Abraham Lincoln in November 1860 was the final trigger for secession. [72] Efforts at compromise, including the " Corwin Amendment " and the " Crittenden Compromise ", failed. Southern leaders feared that Lincoln would stop the expansion of slavery and put it on a course toward extinction. The slave states, which had already become a minority in the House of Representatives, were now facing a future as a perpetual minority in the Senate and Electoral College against an increasingly powerful North. Before Lincoln took office in March 1861, seven slave states had declared their secession and joined to form the Confederacy.

Outbreak of the war

Secession crisis
The election of Lincoln caused the legislature of South Carolina to call a state convention to consider secession. Prior to the war, South Carolina did more than any other Southern state to advance the notion that a state had the right to nullify federal laws and, even, secede from the United States. The convention summoned unanimously voted to secede on December 20, 1860, and adopted the " Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union ". It argued for states' rights for slave owners in the South, but contained a complaint about states' rights in the North in the form of opposition to the Fugitive Slave Act , claiming that Northern states were not fulfilling their federal obligations under the Constitution. The "cotton states" of Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas followed suit, seceding in January and February 1861.
Among the ordinances of secession passed by the individual states, those of three—Texas, Alabama, and Virginia—specifically mentioned the plight of the 'slaveholding states' at the hands of northern abolitionists. The rest make no mention of the slavery issue, and are often brief announcements of the dissolution of ties by the legislatures. [73] However, at least four states—South Carolina, [74] Mississippi, [75] Georgia, [76] and Texas [77] also passed lengthy and detailed explanations of their causes for secession, all of which laid the blame squarely on the movement to abolish slavery and that movement's influence over the politics of the northern states. The southern states believed slaveholding was a constitutional right because of the Fugitive slave clause of the Constitution.
These states agreed to form a new federal government, the Confederate States of America , on February 4, 1861. [78] They took control of federal forts and other properties within their boundaries with little resistance from outgoing President James Buchanan , whose term ended on March 4, 1861. Buchanan said that the Dred Scott decision was proof that the South had no reason for secession, and that the Union "... was intended to be perpetual," but that, "The power by force of arms to compel a State to remain in the Union," was not among the "... enumerated powers granted to Congress." [79] One quarter of the U.S. Army—the entire garrison in Texas—was surrendered in February 1861 to state forces by its commanding general, David E. Twiggs , who then joined the Confederacy.
As Southerners resigned their seats in the Senate and the House, Republicans were able to pass bills for projects that had been blocked by Southern Senators before the war, including the Morrill Tariff , land grant colleges (the Morrill Act ), a Homestead Act , a transcontinental railroad (the Pacific Railway Acts ), [80] the National Banking Act and the authorization of United States Notes by the Legal Tender Act of 1862. The Revenue Act of 1861 introduced the income tax to help finance the war.
On December 18, 1860, the Crittenden Compromise was proposed to re-establish the Missouri Compromise line by constitutionally banning slavery in territories to the north of the line while guaranteeing it to the south. The adoption of this compromise likely would have prevented the secession of every southern state apart from South Carolina, but Lincoln and the Republicans rejected it. [81] It was then proposed to hold a national referendum on the compromise. The Republicans again rejected the idea, although a majority of both Northerners and Southerners would have voted in favor of it. [82] A pre-war February Peace Conference of 1861 met in Washington, proposing a solution similar to that of the Crittenden compromise, it was rejected by Congress. The Republicans proposed an alternative compromise to not interfere with slavery where it existed but the South regarded it as insufficient. Nonetheless, the remaining eight slave states rejected pleas to join the Confederacy following a two-to-one no-vote in Virginia's First Secessionist Convention on April 4, 1861. [83]
On March 4, 1861, Abraham Lincoln was sworn in as President. In his inaugural address , he argued that the Constitution was a more perfect union than the earlier Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union , that it was a binding contract, and called any secession "legally void". [84] He had no intent to invade Southern states, nor did he intend to end slavery where it existed, but said that he would use force to maintain possession of Federal property. The government would make no move to recover post offices, and if resisted, mail delivery would end at state lines. Where popular conditions did not allow peaceful enforcement of Federal law, U.S. Marshals and Judges would be withdrawn. No mention was made of bullion lost from U.S. mints in Louisiana, Georgia and North Carolina. In Lincoln's inaugural address, he stated that it would be U.S. policy to only collect import duties at its ports; there could be no serious injury to the South to justify armed revolution during his administration. His speech closed with a plea for restoration of the bonds of union, famously calling on "the mystic chords of memory" binding the two regions. [85]
The South sent delegations to Washington and offered to pay for the federal properties and enter into a peace treaty with the United States. Lincoln rejected any negotiations with Confederate agents because he claimed the Confederacy was not a legitimate government, and that making any treaty with it would be tantamount to recognition of it as a sovereign government. [86] Secretary of State William Seward who at that time saw himself as the real governor or "prime minister" behind the throne of the inexperienced Lincoln, engaged in unauthorized and indirect negotiations that failed. [86] President Lincoln was determined to hold all remaining Union-occupied forts in the Confederacy, Fort Monroe in Virginia, in Florida, Fort Pickens , Fort Jefferson , and Fort Taylor , and in the cockpit of secession, Charleston, South Carolina's Fort Sumter .

Battle of Fort Sumter
Fort Sumter was located in the middle of the harbor of Charleston , South Carolina, where the U.S. fort's garrison had withdrawn to avoid incidents with local militias in the streets of the city. Unlike Buchanan, who allowed commanders to relinquish possession to avoid bloodshed, Lincoln required Maj. Anderson to hold on until fired upon. Jefferson Davis ordered the surrender of the fort. Anderson gave a conditional reply that the Confederate government rejected, and Davis ordered P. G. T. Beauregard to attack the fort before a relief expedition could arrive. Troops under Beauregard bombarded Fort Sumter on April 12–13, forcing its capitulation.
The attack on Fort Sumter rallied the North to the defense of American nationalism. Historian Allan Nevins says:
However, much of the North's attitude was based on the false belief that only a minority of Southerners were actually in favor of secession and that there were large numbers of southern Unionists that could be counted on. Had Northerners realized that most Southerners really did favor secession, they might have hesitated at attempting the enormous task of conquering a united South. [89]
Lincoln called on all the states to send forces to recapture the fort and other federal properties. With the scale of the rebellion apparently small so far, Lincoln called for only 75,000 volunteers for 90 days. [90] The governor of Massachusetts had state regiments on trains headed south the next day. In western Missouri, local secessionists seized Liberty Arsenal . [91] On May 3, 1861, Lincoln called for an additional 42,000 volunteers for a period of three years. [92]
Four states in the middle and upper South had repeatedly rejected Confederate overtures, but now Virginia , Tennessee , Arkansas , and North Carolina refused to send forces against their neighbors, declared their secession, and joined the Confederacy. To reward Virginia, the Confederate capital was moved to Richmond . [93]

Attitude of the border states
Maryland , Delaware , Missouri , and Kentucky were slave states that were opposed to both secession and coercing the South. West Virginia then joined them as an additional border state after it separated from Virginia and became a state of the Union in 1863.
Maryland's territory surrounded the United States' capital of Washington, DC and could cut it off from the North. [94] It had numerous anti-Lincoln officials who tolerated anti-army rioting in Baltimore and the burning of bridges, both aimed at hindering the passage of troops to the South. Maryland's legislature voted overwhelmingly (53–13) to stay in the Union, but also rejected hostilities with its southern neighbors, voting to close Maryland's rail lines to prevent them from being used for war. [95] Lincoln responded by establishing martial law , and unilaterally suspending habeas corpus , in Maryland, along with sending in militia units from the North. [96] Lincoln rapidly took control of Maryland and the District of Columbia, by seizing many prominent figures, including arresting 1/3 of the members of the Maryland General Assembly on the day it reconvened. [95] [97] All were held without trial, ignoring a ruling by the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court Roger Taney , a Maryland native, that only Congress (and not the president) could suspend habeas corpus ( Ex parte Merryman ). Indeed, federal troops imprisoned a prominent Baltimore newspaper editor, Frank Key Howard , Francis Scott Key's grandson, after he criticized Lincoln in an editorial for ignoring the Supreme Court Chief Justice's ruling. [98]
In Missouri, an elected convention on secession voted decisively to remain within the Union. When pro-Confederate Governor Claiborne F. Jackson called out the state militia, it was attacked by federal forces under General Nathaniel Lyon , who chased the governor and the rest of the State Guard to the southwestern corner of the state. ( See also: Missouri secession ). In the resulting vacuum, the convention on secession reconvened and took power as the Unionist provisional government of Missouri. [99]
Kentucky did not secede; for a time, it declared itself neutral. When Confederate forces entered the state in September 1861, neutrality ended and the state reaffirmed its Union status, while trying to maintain slavery. During a brief invasion by Confederate forces, Confederate sympathizers organized a secession convention, inaugurated a governor, and gained recognition from the Confederacy. The rebel government soon went into exile and never controlled Kentucky. [100]
After Virginia's secession, a Unionist government in Wheeling asked 48 counties to vote on an ordinance to create a new state on October 24, 1861. A voter turnout of 34 percent approved the statehood bill (96 percent approving). [101] The inclusion of 24 secessionist counties [102] in the state and the ensuing guerrilla war engaged about 40,000 Federal troops for much of the war. [103] [104] Congress admitted West Virginia to the Union on June 20, 1863. West Virginia provided about 20,000–22,000 soldiers to both the Confederacy and the Union. [105]
A Unionist secession attempt occurred in East Tennessee , but was suppressed by the Confederacy, which arrested over 3,000 men suspected of being loyal to the Union. They were held without trial. [106]

War
The Civil War was a contest marked by the ferocity and frequency of battle. Over four years, 237 named battles were fought, as were many more minor actions and skirmishes, which were often characterized by their bitter intensity and high casualties. In his book The American Civil War , John Keegan writes that "The American Civil War was to prove one of the most ferocious wars ever fought". Without geographic objectives, the only target for each side was the enemy's soldier. [107]

Mobilization
As the first seven states began organizing a Confederacy in Montgomery, the entire U.S. army numbered 16,000. However, Northern governors had begun to mobilize their militias. [108] The Confederate Congress authorized the new nation up to 100,000 troops sent by governors as early as February. By May, Jefferson Davis was pushing for 100,000 men under arms for one year or the duration, and that was answered in kind by the U.S. Congress. [109]
In the first year of the war, both sides had far more volunteers than they could effectively train and equip. After the initial enthusiasm faded, reliance on the cohort of young men who came of age every year and wanted to join was not enough. Both sides used a draft law— conscription —as a device to encourage or force volunteering; relatively few were actually drafted and served. The Confederacy passed a draft law in April 1862 for young men aged 18 to 35; overseers of slaves, government officials, and clergymen were exempt. [110] The U.S. Congress followed in July, authorizing a militia draft within a state when it could not meet its quota with volunteers. European immigrants joined the Union Army in large numbers, including 177,000 born in Germany and 144,000 born in Ireland. [111]
When the Emancipation Proclamation went into effect in January 1863, ex-slaves were energetically recruited by the states, and used to meet the state quotas. States and local communities offered higher and higher cash bonuses for white volunteers. Congress tightened the law in March 1863. Men selected in the draft could provide substitutes or, until mid-1864, pay commutation money. Many eligibles pooled their money to cover the cost of anyone drafted. Families used the substitute provision to select which man should go into the army and which should stay home. There was much evasion and overt resistance to the draft, especially in Catholic areas. The great draft riot in New York City in July 1863 involved Irish immigrants who had been signed up as citizens to swell the vote of the city's Democratic political machine , not realizing it made them liable for the draft. [112] Of the 168,649 men procured for the Union through the draft, 117,986 were substitutes, leaving only 50,663 who had their personal services conscripted. [113]
In both the North and South, the draft laws were highly unpopular. In the North, some 120,000 men evaded conscription, many of them fleeing to Canada, and another 280,000 soldiers deserted during the war. [114] At least 100,000 Southerners deserted, or about 10 percent. In the South, many men deserted temporarily to take care of their distressed families, then returned to their units. [115] In the North, "bounty jumpers" enlisted to get the generous bonus, deserted, then went back to a second recruiting station under a different name to sign up again for a second bonus; 141 were caught and executed. [116]
From a tiny frontier force in 1860, the Union and Confederate armies had grown into the "largest and most efficient armies in the world" within a few years. European observers at the time dismissed them as amateur and unprofessional, but British historian John Keegan 's assessment is that each outmatched the French, Prussian and Russian armies of the time, and but for the Atlantic, would have threatened any of them with defeat. [117]

Motivation
Perman and Taylor (2010) say that historians are of two minds on why millions of men seemed so eager to fight, suffer and die over four years:

Prisoners
At the start of the civil war, a system of paroles operated. Captives agreed not to fight until they were officially exchanged. Meanwhile, they were held in camps run by their own army where they were paid but not allowed to perform any military duties. [119] The system of exchanges collapsed in 1863 when the Confederacy refused to exchange black prisoners. After that, about 56,000 of the 409,000 POWs died in prisons during the war, accounting for nearly 10 percent of the conflict's fatalities. [120]

Naval war
The small U.S. Navy of 1861 was rapidly enlarged to 6,000 officers and 45,000 men in 1865, with 671 vessels, having a tonnage of 510,396. [121] [122] Its mission was to blockade Confederate ports, take control of the river system, defend against Confederate raiders on the high seas, and be ready for a possible war with the British Royal Navy . [123] Meanwhile, the main riverine war was fought in the West, where a series of major rivers gave access to the Confederate heartland, if the U.S. Navy could take control. In the East, the Navy supplied and moved army forces about, and occasionally shelled Confederate installations.

Union blockade
By early 1861, General Winfield Scott had devised the Anaconda Plan to win the war with as little bloodshed as possible. [124] Scott argued that a Union blockade of the main ports would weaken the Confederate economy. Lincoln adopted parts of the plan, but he overruled Scott's caution about 90-day volunteers. Public opinion, however, demanded an immediate attack by the army to capture Richmond. [125]
In April 1861, Lincoln announced the Union blockade of all Southern ports; commercial ships could not get insurance and regular traffic ended. The South blundered in embargoing cotton exports in 1861 before the blockade was effective; by the time they realized the mistake, it was too late. "King Cotton" was dead, as the South could export less than 10 percent of its cotton. The blockade shut down the ten Confederate seaports with railheads that moved almost all the cotton, especially New Orleans, Mobile, and Charleston. By June 1861, warships were stationed off the principal Southern ports, and a year later nearly 300 ships were in service. [126]

Modern navy evolves
The Civil War occurred during the early stages of the industrial revolution and subsequently many naval innovations emerged during this time, most notably the advent of the ironclad warship . It began when the Confederacy, knowing they had to meet or match the Union's naval superiority, responded to the Union blockade by building or converting more than 130 vessels, including twenty-six ironclads and floating batteries. [127] Only half of these saw active service. Many were equipped with ram bows, creating "ram fever" among Union squadrons wherever they threatened. But in the face of overwhelming Union superiority and the Union's own ironclad warships, they were unsuccessful. [128]
The Confederacy experimented with a submarine , which did not work well, [129] and with building an ironclad ship, the CSS Virginia , which was based on rebuilding a sunken Union ship, the Merrimack . On its first foray on March 8, 1862, the Virginia inflicted significant damage to the Union's wooden fleet, but the next day the first Union ironclad, the USS Monitor , arrived to challenge it. The Battle of the Ironclads was a draw, but it marks the worldwide transition to ironclad warships. [130]
The Confederacy lost the Virginia when the ship was scuttled to prevent capture, and the Union built many copies of the Monitor . Lacking the technology to build effective warships, the Confederacy attempted to obtain warships from Britain. [131]

Blockade runners
British investors built small, fast, steam-driven blockade runners that traded arms and luxuries brought in from Britain through Bermuda, Cuba, and the Bahamas in return for high-priced cotton. Many of the ships were designed for speed and were so small that only a small amount of cotton went out. [132] When the Union Navy seized a blockade runner, the ship and cargo were condemned as a Prize of war and sold, with the proceeds given to the Navy sailors; the captured crewmen were mostly British and they were simply released. [133] The Southern economy nearly collapsed during the war. There were multiple reasons for this: the severe deterioration of food supplies, especially in cities, the failure of Southern railroads, the loss of control of the main rivers, foraging by Northern armies, and the seizure of animals and crops by Confederate armies. Most historians agree that the blockade was a major factor in ruining the Confederate economy, however, Wise argues that the blockade runners provided just enough of a lifeline to allow Lee to continue fighting for additional months, thanks to fresh supplies of 400,000 rifles, lead, blankets, and boots that the homefront economy could no longer supply. [134]

Economic impact
Surdam argues that the blockade was a powerful weapon that eventually ruined the Southern economy, at the cost of few lives in combat. Practically, the entire Confederate cotton crop was useless (although it was sold to Union traders), costing the Confederacy its main source of income. Critical imports were scarce and the coastal trade was largely ended as well. [135] The measure of the blockade's success was not the few ships that slipped through, but the thousands that never tried it. Merchant ships owned in Europe could not get insurance and were too slow to evade the blockade; they simply stopped calling at Confederate ports. [136]
To fight an offensive war, the Confederacy purchased ships from Britain, converted them to warships, and raided American merchant ships in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Insurance rates skyrocketed and the American flag virtually disappeared from international waters. However, the same ships were reflagged with European flags and continued unmolested. [128] After the war, the U.S. demanded that Britain pay for the damage done, and Britain paid the U.S. $15 million in 1871. [137]

Rivers
The 1862 Union strategy called for simultaneous advances along four axes: [138]
Ulysses Grant used river transport and Andrew Foote's gunboats of the Western Flotilla to threaten the Confederacy's "Gibraltar of the West" at Columbus, Kentucky. Though rebuffed at Belmont, Grant cut off Columbus. The Confederates, lacking their own gunboats, were forced to retreat and the Union took control of western Kentucky in March 1862. [139]
In addition to ocean-going warships coming up the Mississippi, the Union Navy used timberclads, tinclads, and armored gunboats. Shipyards at Cairo, Illinois, and St. Louis built new boats or modified steamboats for action. [140] They took control of the Red, Tennessee, Cumberland, Mississippi, and Ohio rivers after victories at Fort Henry (February 6, 1862) and Fort Donelson (February 11 to 16, 1862), and supplied Grant's forces as he moved into Tennessee. At Shiloh (Pittsburg Landing), in Tennessee in April 1862, the Confederates made a surprise attack that pushed Union forces against the river as night fell. Overnight, the Navy landed additional reinforcements, and Grant counter-attacked. Grant and the Union won a decisive victory—the first battle with the high casualty rates that would repeat over and over. [141] Memphis fell to Union forces on June 6, 1862, and became a key base for further advances south along the Mississippi River. On April 24, 1862, U.S. Naval forces under Farragut ran past Confederate defenses south of New Orleans. Confederate forces abandoned the city, giving the Union a critical anchor in the deep South. [142]
Naval forces assisted Grant in the long, complex Vicksburg Campaign that resulted in the Confederates surrendering at Vicksburg, Mississippi in July 1863, and in the Union fully controlling the Mississippi River soon after. [143]

Eastern theater
In one of the first highly visible battles, a march by Union troops under the command of Maj. Gen. Irvin McDowell on the Confederate forces near Washington was repulsed.
Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan took command of the Union Army of the Potomac on July 26 (he was briefly general-in-chief of all the Union armies, but was subsequently relieved of that post in favor of Maj. Gen. Henry W. Halleck ), and the war began in earnest in 1862. Upon the strong urging of President Lincoln to begin offensive operations, McClellan attacked Virginia in the spring of 1862 by way of the peninsula between the York River and James River , southeast of Richmond. Although McClellan's army reached the gates of Richmond in the Peninsula Campaign , [144] [145] [146] Johnston halted his advance at the Battle of Seven Pines , then General Robert E. Lee and top subordinates James Longstreet and Stonewall Jackson defeated McClellan in the Seven Days Battles and forced his retreat. [147] The Northern Virginia Campaign , which included the Second Battle of Bull Run , ended in yet another victory for the South. [148] McClellan resisted General-in-Chief Halleck's orders to send reinforcements to John Pope's Union Army of Virginia , which made it easier for Lee's Confederates to defeat twice the number of combined enemy troops.
Emboldened by Second Bull Run, the Confederacy made its first invasion of the North. General Lee led 45,000 men of the Army of Northern Virginia across the Potomac River into Maryland on September 5. Lincoln then restored Pope's troops to McClellan. McClellan and Lee fought at the Battle of Antietam near Sharpsburg , Maryland, on September 17, 1862, the bloodiest single day in United States military history. [147] [149] Lee's army, checked at last, returned to Virginia before McClellan could destroy it. Antietam is considered a Union victory because it halted Lee's invasion of the North and provided an opportunity for Lincoln to announce his Emancipation Proclamation . [150]
When the cautious McClellan failed to follow up on Antietam, he was replaced by Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside . Burnside was soon defeated at the Battle of Fredericksburg [151] on December 13, 1862, when more than 12,000 Union soldiers were killed or wounded during repeated futile frontal assaults against Marye's Heights. After the battle, Burnside was replaced by Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker .
Hooker, too, proved unable to defeat Lee's army; despite outnumbering the Confederates by more than two to one, he was humiliated in the Battle of Chancellorsville in May 1863. [152] Gen. Stonewall Jackson was shot in the arm by accidental friendly fire during the battle and subsequently died of complications. [153] Gen. Hooker was replaced by Maj. Gen. George Meade during Lee's second invasion of the North, in June. Meade defeated Lee at the Battle of Gettysburg (July 1 to 3, 1863). [154] This was the bloodiest battle of the war, and has been called the war's turning point . Pickett's Charge on July 3 is often considered the high-water mark of the Confederacy because it signaled the collapse of serious Confederate threats of victory. Lee's army suffered 28,000 casualties (versus Meade's 23,000). [155] However, Lincoln was angry that Meade failed to intercept Lee's retreat, and after Meade's inconclusive fall campaign, Lincoln turned to the Western Theater for new leadership. At the same time, the Confederate stronghold of Vicksburg surrendered, giving the Union control of the Mississippi River, permanently isolating the western Confederacy, and producing the new leader Lincoln needed, Ulysses S. Grant .

Western theater
While the Confederate forces had numerous successes in the Eastern Theater, they were defeated many times in the West. They were driven from Missouri early in the war as a result of the Battle of Pea Ridge . [156] Leonidas Polk 's invasion of Columbus , Kentucky ended Kentucky's policy of neutrality and turned that state against the Confederacy. Nashville and central Tennessee fell to the Union early in 1862, leading to attrition of local food supplies and livestock and a breakdown in social organization.
The Mississippi was opened to Union traffic to the southern border of Tennessee with the taking of Island No. 10 and New Madrid , Missouri, and then Memphis, Tennessee . In April 1862, the Union Navy captured New Orleans, [157] which allowed Union forces to begin moving up the Mississippi. Only the fortress city of Vicksburg , Mississippi, prevented Union control of the entire river.
General Braxton Bragg 's second Confederate invasion of Kentucky ended with a meaningless victory over Maj. Gen. Don Carlos Buell at the Battle of Perryville , although Bragg was forced to end his attempt at invading Kentucky and retreat due to lack of support for the Confederacy in that state. [158] Bragg was narrowly defeated by Maj. Gen. William Rosecrans at the Battle of Stones River in Tennessee . [159]
The one clear Confederate victory in the West was the Battle of Chickamauga . Bragg, reinforced by Lt. Gen. James Longstreet 's corps (from Lee's army in the east), defeated Rosecrans, despite the heroic defensive stand of Maj. Gen. George Henry Thomas . Rosecrans retreated to Chattanooga , which Bragg then besieged.
The Union's key strategist and tactician in the West was Ulysses S. Grant , who won victories at Forts Henry and Donelson (by which the Union seized control of the Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers); the Battle of Shiloh ; [160] and the Battle of Vicksburg , [161] which cemented Union control of the Mississippi River and is considered one of the turning points of the war. Grant marched to the relief of Rosecrans and defeated Bragg at the Third Battle of Chattanooga , [162] driving Confederate forces out of Tennessee and opening a route to Atlanta and the heart of the Confederacy.

Trans-Mississippi
Extensive guerrilla warfare characterized the trans-Mississippi region, as the Confederacy lacked the troops and the logistics to support regular armies that could challenge Union control. [165] Roving Confederate bands such as Quantrill's Raiders terrorized the countryside, striking both military installations and civilian settlements. [166] The "Sons of Liberty" and "Order of the American Knights" attacked pro-Union people, elected officeholders, and unarmed uniformed soldiers. These partisans could not be entirely driven out of the state of Missouri until an entire regular Union infantry division was engaged.
By 1864, these violent activities harmed the nationwide anti-war movement organizing against the re-election of Lincoln. Missouri not only stayed in the Union, Lincoln took 70 percent of the vote for re-election. [163]
Numerous small-scale military actions south and west of Missouri sought to control Indian Territory and New Mexico Territory for the Union. The Union repulsed Confederate incursions into New Mexico in 1862, and the exiled Arizona government withdrew into Texas. In the Indian Territory, civil war broke out within tribes. About 12,000 Indian warriors fought for the Confederacy, and smaller numbers for the Union. [167] The most prominent Cherokee was Brigadier General Stand Watie , the last Confederate general to surrender. [168]
After the fall of Vicksburg in July 1863, General Kirby Smith in Texas was informed by Jefferson Davis that he could expect no further help from east of the Mississippi River. Although he lacked resources to beat Union armies, he built up a formidable arsenal at Tyler, along with his own Kirby Smithdom economy, a virtual "independent fiefdom" in Texas, including railroad construction and international smuggling. The Union in turn did not directly engage him. [169] Its 1864 Red River Campaign to take Shreveport, Louisiana was a failure and Texas remained in Confederate hands throughout the war.

End of the war

Conquest of Virginia
At the beginning of 1864, Lincoln made Grant commander of all Union armies. Grant made his headquarters with the Army of the Potomac, and put Maj. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman in command of most of the western armies. Grant understood the concept of total war and believed, along with Lincoln and Sherman, that only the utter defeat of Confederate forces and their economic base would end the war. [170] This was total war not in killing civilians but rather in taking provisions and forage and destroying homes, farms, and railroads, that Grant said "would otherwise have gone to the support of secession and rebellion. This policy I believe exercised a material influence in hastening the end." [171] Grant devised a coordinated strategy that would strike at the entire Confederacy from multiple directions. Generals George Meade and Benjamin Butler were ordered to move against Lee near Richmond, General Franz Sigel (and later Philip Sheridan ) were to attack the Shenandoah Valley , General Sherman was to capture Atlanta and march to the sea (the Atlantic Ocean), Generals George Crook and William W. Averell were to operate against railroad supply lines in West Virginia , and Maj. Gen. Nathaniel P. Banks was to capture Mobile , Alabama. [172]
Grant's army set out on the Overland Campaign with the goal of drawing Lee into a defense of Richmond, where they would attempt to pin down and destroy the Confederate army. The Union army first attempted to maneuver past Lee and fought several battles, notably at the Wilderness , Spotsylvania , and Cold Harbor . These battles resulted in heavy losses on both sides, and forced Lee's Confederates to fall back repeatedly. An attempt to outflank Lee from the south failed under Butler, who was trapped inside the Bermuda Hundred river bend. Each battle resulted in setbacks for the Union that mirrored what they had suffered under prior generals, though unlike those prior generals, Grant fought on rather than retreat. Grant was tenacious and kept pressing Lee's Army of Northern Virginia back to Richmond. While Lee was preparing for an attack on Richmond, Grant unexpectedly turned south to cross the James River and began the protracted Siege of Petersburg , where the two armies engaged in trench warfare for over nine months. [173]
Grant finally found a commander, General Philip Sheridan , aggressive enough to prevail in the Valley Campaigns of 1864 . Sheridan was initially repelled at the Battle of New Market by former U.S. Vice President and Confederate Gen. John C. Breckinridge . The Battle of New Market was the Confederacy's last major victory of the war. After redoubling his efforts, Sheridan defeated Maj. Gen. Jubal A. Early in a series of battles, including a final decisive defeat at the Battle of Cedar Creek . Sheridan then proceeded to destroy the agricultural base of the Shenandoah Valley , a strategy similar to the tactics Sherman later employed in Georgia. [174]
Meanwhile, Sherman maneuvered from Chattanooga to Atlanta, defeating Confederate Generals Joseph E. Johnston and John Bell Hood along the way. The fall of Atlanta on September 2, 1864, guaranteed the reelection of Lincoln as president. [175] Hood left the Atlanta area to swing around and menace Sherman's supply lines and invade Tennessee in the Franklin-Nashville Campaign . Union Maj. Gen. John Schofield defeated Hood at the Battle of Franklin , and George H. Thomas dealt Hood a massive defeat at the Battle of Nashville , effectively destroying Hood's army. [176]
Leaving Atlanta, and his base of supplies, Sherman's army marched with an unknown destination, laying waste to about 20 percent of the farms in Georgia in his " March to the Sea ". He reached the Atlantic Ocean at Savannah , Georgia in December 1864. Sherman's army was followed by thousands of freed slaves; there were no major battles along the March. Sherman turned north through South Carolina and North Carolina to approach the Confederate Virginia lines from the south, increasing the pressure on Lee's army. [177]
Lee's army, thinned by desertion and casualties, was now much smaller than Grant's. One last Confederate attempt to break the Union hold on Petersburg failed at the decisive Battle of Five Forks (sometimes called "the Waterloo of the Confederacy") on April 1. This meant that the Union now controlled the entire perimeter surrounding Richmond-Petersburg, completely cutting it off from the Confederacy. Realizing that the capital was now lost, Lee decided to evacuate his army. The Confederate capital fell to the Union XXV Corps , composed of black troops. The remaining Confederate units fled west after a defeat at Sayler's Creek . [178]

Confederacy surrenders
Initially, Lee did not intend to surrender, but planned to regroup at the village of Appomattox Court House , where supplies were to be waiting, and then continue the war. Grant chased Lee and got in front of him, so that when Lee's army reached Appomattox Court House, they were surrounded. After an initial battle, Lee decided that the fight was now hopeless, and surrendered his Army of Northern Virginia on April 9, 1865, at the McLean House . [179] In an untraditional gesture and as a sign of Grant's respect and anticipation of peacefully restoring Confederate states to the Union, Lee was permitted to keep his sword and his horse, Traveller . On April 14, 1865, President Lincoln was shot by John Wilkes Booth , a Southern sympathizer. Lincoln died early the next morning, and Andrew Johnson became the president. Meanwhile, Confederate forces across the South surrendered as news of Lee's surrender reached them. [180] On April 26, 1865, General Joseph E. Johnston surrendered nearly 90,000 men of the Army of Tennessee to Major General William T. Sherman at the Bennett Place near present-day Durham, North Carolina. It proved to be the largest surrender of Confederate forces, effectively bringing the war to an end. President Johnson officially declared a virtual end to the insurrection on May 9, 1865; President Jefferson Davis was captured the following day. [1] On June 2, Kirby Smith officially surrendered his troops in the Trans-Mississippi Department. [181] On June 23, Cherokee leader Stand Watie became the last Confederate General to surrender his forces. [182]

Diplomacy
Though the Confederacy hoped that Britain and France would join them against the Union, this was never likely, and so they instead tried to bring Britain and France in as mediators. [183] [184] The Union, under Lincoln and Secretary of State William H. Seward worked to block this, and threatened war if any country officially recognized the existence of the Confederate States of America. In 1861, Southerners voluntarily embargoed cotton shipments, hoping to start an economic depression in Europe that would force Britain to enter the war to get cotton, but this did not work. Worse, Europe developed other cotton suppliers, which they found superior, hindering the South's recovery after the war. [185]
Cotton diplomacy proved a failure as Europe had a surplus of cotton, while the 1860–62 crop failures in Europe made the North's grain exports of critical importance. It also helped to turn European opinion further away from the Confederacy. It was said that "King Corn was more powerful than King Cotton", as U.S. grain went from a quarter of the British import trade to almost half. [185] When Britain did face a cotton shortage, it was temporary, being replaced by increased cultivation in Egypt and India. Meanwhile, the war created employment for arms makers, ironworkers, and British ships to transport weapons. [186]
Lincoln's foreign policy was deficient in 1861 in terms of appealing to European public opinion. Diplomats had to explain that United States was not committed to the ending of slavery, but instead they repeated legalistic arguments about the unconstitutionality of secession. Confederate spokesman, on the other hand, were much more successful by ignoring slavery and instead focusing on their struggle for liberty, their commitment to free trade, and the essential role of cotton in the European economy. In addition, the European aristocracy (the dominant factor in every major country) was "absolutely gleeful in pronouncing the American debacle as proof that the entire experiment in popular government had failed. European government leaders welcomed the fragmentation of the ascendant American Republic." [187]
U.S. minister to Britain Charles Francis Adams proved particularly adept and convinced Britain not to boldly challenge the blockade. The Confederacy purchased several warships from commercial shipbuilders in Britain ( CSS Alabama , CSS Shenandoah , CSS Tennessee , CSS Tallahassee , CSS Florida , and some others). The most famous, the CSS Alabama , did considerable damage and led to serious postwar disputes . However, public opinion against slavery created a political liability for politicians in Britain, where the antislavery movement was powerful. [188]
War loomed in late 1861 between the U.S. and Britain over the Trent affair , involving the U.S. Navy's boarding of the British ship Trent and seizure of two Confederate diplomats. However, London and Washington were able to smooth over the problem after Lincoln released the two. In 1862, the British considered mediation between North and South– though even such an offer would have risked war with the U.S. British Prime Minister Lord Palmerston reportedly read Uncle Tom's Cabin three times when deciding on this. [189]
The Union victory in the Battle of Antietam caused them to delay this decision. The Emancipation Proclamation over time would reinforce the political liability of supporting the Confederacy. Despite sympathy for the Confederacy, France's own seizure of Mexico ultimately deterred them from war with the Union. Confederate offers late in the war to end slavery in return for diplomatic recognition were not seriously considered by London or Paris. After 1863, the Polish revolt against Russia further distracted the European powers, and ensured that they would remain neutral. [190]

Union victory and aftermath

Results
The causes of the war , the reasons for its outcome, and even the name of the war itself are subjects of lingering contention today. The North and West grew rich while the once-rich South became poor for a century. The national political power of the slaveowners and rich southerners ended. Historians are less sure about the results of the postwar Reconstruction, especially regarding the second class citizenship of the Freedmen and their poverty. [191]
Historians have debated whether the Confederacy could have won the war. Most scholars, such as James McPherson , argue that Confederate victory was at least possible. [192] McPherson argues that the North's advantage in population and resources made Northern victory likely but not guaranteed. He also argues that if the Confederacy had fought using unconventional tactics, they would have more easily been able to hold out long enough to exhaust the Union. [193]
Confederates did not need to invade and hold enemy territory to win, but only needed to fight a defensive war to convince the North that the cost of winning was too high. The North needed to conquer and hold vast stretches of enemy territory and defeat Confederate armies to win. [193] Lincoln was not a military dictator, and could only continue to fight the war as long as the American public supported a continuation of the war. The Confederacy sought to win independence by out-lasting Lincoln; however, after Atlanta fell and Lincoln defeated McClellan in the election of 1864, all hope for a political victory for the South ended. At that point, Lincoln had secured the support of the Republicans, War Democrats, the border states, emancipated slaves, and the neutrality of Britain and France. By defeating the Democrats and McClellan, he also defeated the Copperheads and their peace platform. [197]
Many scholars argue that the Union held an insurmountable long-term advantage over the Confederacy in industrial strength and population. Confederate actions, they argue, only delayed defeat. [198] [199] Civil War historian Shelby Foote expressed this view succinctly: "I think that the North fought that war with one hand behind its back ... If there had been more Southern victories, and a lot more, the North simply would have brought that other hand out from behind its back. I don't think the South ever had a chance to win that War." [200]
A minority view among historians is that the Confederacy lost because, as E. Merton Coulter put it, "people did not will hard enough and long enough to win." [201] [202] Marxist historian Armstead Robinson agrees, pointing to a class conflict in the Confederates army between the slave owners and the larger number of non-owners. He argues that the non-owner soldiers grew embittered about fighting to preserve slavery, and fought less enthusiastically. He attributes the major Confederate defeats in 1863 at Vicksburg and Missionary Ridge to this class conflict. [203] However, most historians reject the argument. [204] James M. McPherson , after reading thousands of letters written by Confederate soldiers, found strong patriotism that continued to the end; they truly believed they were fighting for freedom and liberty. Even as the Confederacy was visibly collapsing in 1864–65, he says most Confederate soldiers were fighting hard. [205] Historian Gary Gallagher cites General Sherman who in early 1864 commented, "The devils seem to have a determination that cannot but be admired." Despite their loss of slaves and wealth, with starvation looming, Sherman continued, "yet I see no sign of let up—some few deserters—plenty tired of war, but the masses determined to fight it out." [206]
Also important were Lincoln's eloquence in rationalizing the national purpose and his skill in keeping the border states committed to the Union cause. The Emancipation Proclamation was an effective use of the President's war powers. [207] The Confederate government failed in its attempt to get Europe involved in the war militarily, particularly Britain and France. Southern leaders needed to get European powers to help break up the blockade the Union had created around the Southern ports and cities. Lincoln's naval blockade was 95 percent effective at stopping trade goods; as a result, imports and exports to the South declined significantly. The abundance of European cotton and Britain's hostility to the institution of slavery, along with Lincoln's Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico naval blockades, severely decreased any chance that either Britain or France would enter the war. [208]
Historian Don Doyle has argued that the Union victory had a major impact on the course of world history. [209] The Union victory energized popular democratic forces. A Confederate victory, on the other hand, would have meant a new birth of slavery, not freedom. Historian Fergus Bordewich, following Doyle, argues that:

Costs
The war produced at least 1,030,000 casualties (3 percent of the population), including about 620,000 soldier deaths—two-thirds by disease, and 50,000 civilians. [12] Binghamton University historian J. David Hacker believes the number of soldier deaths was approximately 750,000, 20 percent higher than traditionally estimated, and possibly as high as 850,000. [20] [211] The war accounted for more American deaths than in all other U.S. wars combined. [212]
Based on 1860 census figures, 8 percent of all white males aged 13 to 43 died in the war, including 6 percent in the North and 18 percent in the South. [213] [214] About 56,000 soldiers died in prison camps during the War. [215] An estimated 60,000 men lost limbs in the war. [216]
Union army dead, amounting to 15 percent of the over two million who served, was broken down as follows: [7]
In addition there were 4,523 deaths in the Navy (2,112 in battle) and 460 in the Marines (148 in battle). [8]
Black troops made up 10 percent of the Union death toll, they amounted to 15 percent of disease deaths but less than 3 percent of those killed in battle. [7] Losses among African Americans were high, in the last year and a half and from all reported casualties, approximately 20 percent of all African Americans enrolled in the military lost their lives during the Civil War. [217] :16 Notably, their mortality rate was significantly higher than white soldiers:
Confederate records compiled by historian William F. Fox list 74,524 killed and died of wounds and 59,292 died of disease. Including Confederate estimates of battle losses where no records exist would bring the Confederate death toll to 94,000 killed and died of wounds. Fox complained, however, that records were incomplete, especially during the last year of the war, and that battlefield reports likely under-counted deaths (many men counted as wounded in battlefield reports subsequently died of their wounds). Thomas L. Livermore, using Fox's data, put the number of Confederate non-combat deaths at 166,000, using the official estimate of Union deaths from disease and accidents and a comparison of Union and Confederate enlistment records, for a total of 260,000 deaths. [7] However, this excludes the 30,000 deaths of Confederate troops in prisons, which would raise the minimum number of deaths to 290,000.
The United States National Park Service uses the following figures in its official tally of war losses: [3]
Union: 853,838
Confederate: 914,660
While the figures of 360,000 army deaths for the Union and 260,000 for the Confederacy remained commonly cited, they are incomplete. In addition to many Confederate records being missing, partly as a result of Confederate widows not reporting deaths due to being ineligible for benefits, both armies only counted troops who died during their service, and not the tens of thousands who died of wounds or diseases after being discharged. This often happened only a few days or weeks later. Francis Amasa Walker , Superintendent of the 1870 Census, used census and Surgeon General data to estimate a minimum of 500,000 Union military deaths and 350,000 Confederate military deaths, for a total death toll of 850,000 soldiers. While Walker's estimates were originally dismissed because of the 1870 Census's undercounting, it was later found that the census was only off by 6.5%, and that the data Walker used would be roughly accurate. [211]
Analyzing the number of dead by using census data to calculate the deviation of the death rate of men of fighting age from the norm suggests that at least 627,000 and at most 888,000, but most likely 761,000 soldiers, died in the war. [21] This would break down to approximately 350,000 Confederate and 411,000 Union military deaths, going by the proportion of Union to Confederate battle losses.
Deaths among former slaves has proven much harder to estimate, due to the lack of reliable census data at the time, though they were known to be considerable, as former slaves were set free or escaped in massive numbers in an area where the Union army did not have sufficient shelter, doctors, or food for them. University of Connecticut Professor James Downs states that tens to hundreds of thousands of slaves died during the war from disease, starvation, exposure, or execution at the hands of the Confederates, and that if these deaths are counted in the war's total, the death toll would exceed 1 million. [218]
Losses were far higher than during the recent defeat of Mexico , which saw roughly thirteen thousand American deaths, including fewer than two thousand killed in battle, between 1846 and 1848. One reason for the high number of battle deaths during the war was the continued use of tactics similar to those of the Napoleonic Wars at the turn of the century, such as charging . With the advent of more accurate rifled barrels, Minié balls and (near the end of the war for the Union army ) repeating firearms such as the Spencer Repeating Rifle and the Henry Repeating Rifle , soldiers were mowed down when standing in lines in the open. This led to the adoption of trench warfare , a style of fighting that defined much of World War I. [219]
The wealth amassed in slaves and slavery for the Confederacy's 3.5 million blacks effectively ended when Union armies arrived; they were nearly all freed by the Emancipation Proclamation. Slaves in the border states and those located in some former Confederate territory occupied before the Emancipation Proclamation were freed by state action or (on December 6, 1865) by the Thirteenth Amendment . [220]
The war destroyed much of the wealth that had existed in the South. All accumulated investment Confederate bonds was forfeit; most banks and railroads were bankrupt. Income per person in the South dropped to less than 40 percent of that of the North, a condition that lasted until well into the 20th century. Southern influence in the U.S. federal government, previously considerable, was greatly diminished until the latter half of the 20th century. [221] The full restoration of the Union was the work of a highly contentious postwar era known as Reconstruction .

Emancipation

Slavery as a war issue
While not all Southerners saw themselves as fighting to preserve slavery, most of the officers and over a third of the rank and file in Lee 's army had close family ties to slavery. To Northerners, in contrast, the motivation was primarily to preserve the Union , not to abolish slavery. [222] Abraham Lincoln consistently made preserving the Union the central goal of the war, though he increasingly saw slavery as a crucial issue and made ending it an additional goal. [223] Lincoln's decision to issue the Emancipation Proclamation angered both Peace Democrats ("Copperheads") and War Democrats , but energized most Republicans. [224] By warning that free blacks would flood the North, Democrats made gains in the 1862 elections , but they did not gain control of Congress. The Republicans' counterargument that slavery was the mainstay of the enemy steadily gained support, with the Democrats losing decisively in the 1863 elections in the northern state of Ohio when they tried to resurrect anti-black sentiment. [225]

Emancipation Proclamation
The Emancipation Proclamation enabled African-Americans, both free blacks and escaped slaves, to join the Union Army. [N 4] About 190,000 volunteered, further enhancing the numerical advantage the Union armies enjoyed over the Confederates, who did not dare emulate the equivalent manpower source for fear of fundamentally undermining the legitimacy of slavery. [N 5]
During the Civil War, sentiment concerning slaves, enslavement and emancipation in the United States was divided. In 1861, Lincoln worried that premature attempts at emancipation would mean the loss of the border states, and that "to lose Kentucky is nearly the same as to lose the whole game." [231] Copperheads and some War Democrats opposed emancipation, although the latter eventually accepted it as part of total war needed to save the Union. [232]
At first, Lincoln reversed attempts at emancipation by Secretary of War Simon Cameron and Generals John C. Frémont (in Missouri) and David Hunter (in South Carolina, Georgia and Florida) to keep the loyalty of the border states and the War Democrats. Lincoln warned the border states that a more radical type of emancipation would happen if his gradual plan based on compensated emancipation and voluntary colonization was rejected. [233] But only the District of Columbia accepted Lincoln's gradual plan, which was enacted by Congress. When Lincoln told his cabinet about his proposed emancipation proclamation, Seward advised Lincoln to wait for a victory before issuing it, as to do otherwise would seem like "our last shriek on the retreat". [234] Lincoln laid the groundwork for public support in an open letter published letter to abolitionist Horace Greeley's newspaper. [235]
In September 1862, the Battle of Antietam provided this opportunity, and the subsequent War Governors' Conference added support for the proclamation. [236] Lincoln issued his preliminary Emancipation Proclamation on September 22, 1862, and his final Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863. In his letter to Albert G. Hodges , Lincoln explained his belief that "If slavery is not wrong, nothing is wrong ... And yet I have never understood that the Presidency conferred upon me an unrestricted right to act officially upon this judgment and feeling ... I claim not to have controlled events, but confess plainly that events have controlled me." [237]
Lincoln's moderate approach succeeded in inducing border states, War Democrats and emancipated slaves to fight for the Union. The Union-controlled border states (Kentucky, Missouri, Maryland, Delaware and West Virginia) and Union-controlled regions around New Orleans, Norfolk and elsewhere, were not covered by the Emancipation Proclamation. All abolished slavery on their own, except Kentucky and Delaware. [238]
Since the Emancipation Proclamation was based on the President's war powers, it only included territory held by Confederates at the time. However, the Proclamation became a symbol of the Union's growing commitment to add emancipation to the Union's definition of liberty. [239] The Emancipation Proclamation greatly reduced the Confederacy's hope of getting aid from Britain or France. [240] By late 1864, Lincoln was playing a leading role in getting Congress to vote for the Thirteenth Amendment , which made emancipation universal and permanent. [241]

Texas v. White
In Texas v. White , 74 U.S. 700 (1869) the United States Supreme Court ruled that Texas had remained a state ever since it first joined the Union, despite claims that it joined the Confederate States ; the court further held that the Constitution did not permit states to unilaterally secede from the United States, and that the ordinances of secession, and all the acts of the legislatures within seceding states intended to give effect to such ordinances, were "absolutely null ", under the constitution. [242]

Reconstruction
Reconstruction began during the war, with the Emancipation Proclamation of January 1, 1863, and it continued until 1877. [243] It comprised multiple complex methods to resolve the outstanding issues of the war's aftermath, the most important of which were the three " Reconstruction Amendments " to the Constitution, which remain in effect to the present time: the 13th (1865), the 14th (1868) and the 15th (1870). From the Union perspective, the goals of Reconstruction were to consolidate the Union victory on the battlefield by reuniting the Union; to guarantee a " republican form of government for the ex-Confederate states; and to permanently end slavery—and prevent semi-slavery status. [244]
President Johnson took a lenient approach and saw the achievement of the main war goals as realized in 1865, when each ex-rebel state repudiated secession and ratified the Thirteenth Amendment. Radical Republicans demanded proof that Confederate nationalism was dead and that the slaves were truly free. They came to the fore after the 1866 elections and undid much of Johnson's work. In 1872 the "Liberal Republicans" argued that the war goals had been achieved and that Reconstruction should end. They ran a presidential ticket in 1872 but were decisively defeated. In 1874, Democrats, primarily Southern, took control of Congress and opposed any more reconstruction. The Compromise of 1877 closed with a national consensus that the Civil War had finally ended. [245] With the withdrawal of federal troops, however, whites retook control of every Southern legislature; the Jim Crow period of disenfranchisement and legal segregation was about to begin.

Memory and historiography
The Civil War is one of the central events in American collective memory. There are innumerable statues, commemorations, books and archival collections. The memory includes the home front, military affairs, the treatment of soldiers, both living and dead, in the war's aftermath, depictions of the war in literature and art, evaluations of heroes and villains, and considerations of the moral and political lessons of the war. [246] The last theme includes moral evaluations of racism and slavery, heroism in combat and heroism behind the lines, and the issues of democracy and minority rights, as well as the notion of an " Empire of Liberty " influencing the world. [247]
Professional historians have paid much more attention to the causes of the war, than to the war itself. Military history has largely developed outside academe, leading to a proliferation of solid studies by non-scholars who are thoroughly familiar with the primary sources, pay close attention to battles and campaigns, and write for the large public readership, rather than the small scholarly community. Bruce Catton and Shelby Foote are among the best-known writers. [248] [249] Practically every major figure in the war, both North and South, has had a serious biographical study. [250] Deeply religious Southerners saw the hand of God in history, which demonstrated His wrath at their sinfulness, or His rewards for their suffering. Historian Wilson Fallin has examined the sermons of white and black Baptist preachers after the War. Southern white preachers said:
In sharp contrast, Black preachers interpreted the Civil War as:

Lost Cause
Memory of the war in the white South crystallized in the myth of the "Lost Cause" , shaping regional identity and race relations for generations. [253] Alan T. Nolan notes that the Lost Cause was expressly "a rationalization, a cover-up to vindicate the name and fame" of those in rebellion. Some claims revolve around the insignificance of slavery; some appeals highlight cultural differences between North and South; the military conflict by Confederate actors is idealized; in any case, secession was said to be lawful. [254] Nolan argues that the adoption of the Lost Cause perspective facilitated the reunification of the North and the South while excusing the "virulent racism" of the 19th century, sacrificing African-American progress to a white man's reunification. He also deems the Lost Cause "a caricature of the truth. This caricature wholly misrepresents and distorts the facts of the matter" in every instance. [255]

Beardian historiography
The interpretation of the Civil War presented by Charles A. Beard and Mary R. Beard in The Rise of American Civilization (1927) was highly influential among historians and the general public until the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s. The Beards downplayed slavery, abolitionism, and issues of morality. They ignored constitutional issues of states' rights and even ignored American nationalism as the force that finally led to victory in the war. Indeed, the ferocious combat itself was passed over as merely an ephemeral event. Much more important was the calculus of class conflict. The Beards announced that the Civil War was really:
The Beards themselves abandoned their interpretation by the 1940s and it became defunct among historians in the 1950s, when scholars shifted to an emphasis on slavery. However, Beardian themes still echo among Lost Cause writers. [257]

Civil War commemoration
The American Civil War has been commemorated in many capacities ranging from the reenactment of battles, to statues and memorial halls erected, to films being produced, to stamps and coins with Civil War themes being issued, all of which helped to shape public memory. This varied advent occurred in greater proportions on the 100th and 150th anniversary. [258] Hollywood 's take on the war has been especially influential in shaping public memory, as seen in such film classics as Birth of a Nation (1915), Gone with the Wind (1939), and more recently Lincoln (2012). Ken Burns produced a notable PBS series on television titled The Civil War (1990). It was digitally remastered and re-released in 2015.

Technological significance
There were numerous technological innovations during the Civil War that had a great impact on 19th century science. The Civil War was one of the earliest examples of an " industrial war ", in which technological might is used to achieve military supremacy in a war. [259] New inventions, such as the train and telegraph , delivered soldiers, supplies and messages at a time when horses were considered to be the fastest way to travel. [260] [261] It was also in this war when countries first used aerial warfare, in the form of reconnaissance balloons , to a significant effect. [262] It saw the first action involving steam-powered ironclad warships in naval warfare history. [263] Repeating firearms such as the Henry rifle , Spencer rifle , Colt revolving rifle , Triplett & Scott carbine and others, first appeared during the Civil War; they were a revolutionary invention that would soon replace muzzle-loading and single-shot firearms in warfare, as well as the first appearances of rapid-firing weapons and machine guns such as the Agar gun and the Gatling gun . [264]

Terabyte
The terabyte is a multiple of the unit byte for digital information . The prefix tera represents the fourth power of 1000, and means 10 12 in the International System of Units (SI), and therefore one terabyte is one trillion ( short scale ) bytes. The unit symbol for the terabyte is TB .
1 TB = 1 000 000 000 000 bytes = 10 12 bytes = 1 000 gigabytes .
A related unit, the tebibyte (TiB), using a binary prefix , is equal to 1024 4 bytes. One terabyte is about 0.9095 TiB. Despite the introduction of these standardized binary prefixes, the terabyte is still also commonly used in some computer operating systems , primarily Microsoft Windows , to denote 1 099 511 627 776 (1024 4 or 2 40 ) bytes for disk drive capacity.

Censorship of Wikipedia
Censorship of Wikipedia has occurred in several countries, including China, France, Iran, Pakistan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Thailand, Tunisia, Turkey, [1] the United Kingdom and Uzbekistan. Some instances are examples of widespread internet censorship in general that includes Wikipedia content. Others are indicative of measures to prevent the viewing of specific content deemed offensive.

By country

China
Chinese Wikipedia was launched in May 2001. [2] Wikipedia received positive coverage in China's state press in early 2004, but it was blocked on 3 June 2004 on the 15th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 . Proposals to practice self-censorship in a bid to restore the site were rejected by the Chinese Wikipedia community. [2] However, a story in the International Herald Tribune comparing entries on Chinese Wikipedia and English Wikipedia on topics such as Mao Zedong and Taiwan concluded that the Chinese entries were "watered down and sanitized" of political controversy. [3] On 22 June 2004, access to Wikipedia was restored without explanation. [2] Wikipedia was blocked again for unknown reasons in September, [4] but only for four days. [2] Wikipedia was blocked in China in October 2005. Wikipedia users Shi Zhao and Cui Wei wrote letters to technicians and authorities to try to convince them to unblock the website. Part of the letter read, "By blocking Wikipedia, we lose a chance to present China's voice to the world, allowing evil cults, Taiwan independence forces and others . . . to present a distorted image of China." [2]
In October 2006, The New York Times reported that English Wikipedia was unblocked in China, although Chinese Wikipedia remained blocked. New media researcher Andrew Lih blogged that he could not read the English-language article on the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 in China. [5] Lih said that "there is no monolithically operating Great Firewall of China ", noting that for users of various internet service providers in different locations in China– China Netcom in Beijing, China Telecom in Shanghai, and various providers in Anhui —Chinese Wikipedia was only blocked in Anhui. [6] Advocacy organization Reporters Without Borders praised Wikipedia's leaders for not self-censoring . [7]
On 10 November 2006, Lih reported that Chinese Wikipedia appeared to have been fully unblocked. [8] Lih confirmed the full unblocking several days later and offered a partial analysis of the effects based on the rate of new account creation on Chinese Wikipedia. Prior to the unblocking, 300–400 new accounts were created on Chinese Wikipedia daily. In the four days after the unblocking, the rate of new registrations more than tripled to over 1,200 daily, jumping into the second fastest growing Wikipedia after the English version. Similarly, there were 75% more articles created in the week ending on 13 November than during the week before. Coming on the same weekend that Chinese Wikipedia passed the 100,000 article mark, Lih predicted that the second 100,000 would come quickly but that the existing body of Chinese Wikipedia users would have their hands full teaching the new users basic Wikipedia policies and norms. [9]
On 16 November 2006, Reuters news agency reported the main page of Chinese Wikipedia could be displayed, except for some taboo political subjects, such as "4 June, [1989 protests]". [10] However, subsequent reports suggested that both the Chinese and English versions had been reblocked the next day on 17 November. [11] On 15 June 2007, access to apolitical articles on English Wikipedia was restored. [12] On 6 September 2007, IDG News reported that English Wikipedia was blocked again. [13] On 2 April 2008, The Register reported that the blocks on English and Chinese Wikipedias were lifted. [14] [15] This was confirmed by the BBC , and came within the context of foreign journalists arriving in Beijing to report on the 2008 Summer Olympics and the International Olympic Committee 's request for press freedom during the games. [16] In September 2008, Jimmy Wales had a meeting with Cai Mingzhao , Vice Director of China's State Council Information Office . While no agreements were made, Wales believes that a channel of communication has been opened between Wikipedia's community and the PRC Government . [17] The blocking of Chinese Wikipedia not only reduced group size of its users, but also decreased the nonblocked users' contributions by 42.8% on average, according to a report published on American Economic Review in 2011. [18] As of 2012 [update] , both Chinese and English Wikipedias are accessible in China [19] except for political articles. If a Chinese IP tries to access (including searching) a "sensitive" article, the IP will be blocked from visiting Wikipedia for from several minutes to up to an hour. [20]
Chinese authorities started blocking access to the secure ( HTTPS ) version of the site on 31 May 2013, although the non-secure ( HTTP ) version is still available – the latter is vulnerable to keyword filtering allowing individual articles to be selectively blocked. Greatfire urged Wikipedia and users to circumvent the block by using HTTPS access to other IP addresses owned by Wikipedia. [21] In 2013, after Jimmy Wales stated that Wikipedia will not tolerate "5 seconds" of censorship, Shen Yi, an Internet researcher at Fudan University in Shanghai said, that while "Wikipedia is tough against the Chinese government, it may not necessarily be so grand when faced with US government or European justice systems' requirements to modify or delete articles or disclose information". [22]
Since June 2015, all Wikipedias redirect HTTP requests to the corresponding HTTPS addresses, thereby making encryption mandatory for all users. As a result, Chinese censors cannot see which specific pages an individual is viewing, and therefore cannot block a specific subset of pages (such as Ai Weiwei or Tiananmen Square ) as they did in past years. As a result, Beijing chose to block the whole Chinese Wikipedia; [23] as of June 2015, both encrypted and un-encrypted Chinese-language Wikipedia are blocked. [24] On August 31 the Chinese Wikipedia main pages was unblocked, but only for a short few minutes. Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales said he would fly to China to lobby the Chinese government to unlock the site within two weeks at the Leadership Energy Summit Asia 2015 in Kuala Lumpur on 2 December 2015. It seemed that Wales' statement reminded the Chinese government that they had only blocked the Chinese version of Wikipedia, because Beijing completely blocked all language versions of the site again on the afternoon of 4 December (local time). [25] A large number of Chinese netizens complained about this blocking on social networks, although most of the complaints had been deleted after a short period. [26] However, it became possible to visit Wikipedia in other languages on the afternoon of December 6 (local time) in China again. [27]
Jimmy Wales met Lu Wei , the director of Cyberspace Administration of China on 17 December 2015 during the World Internet Conference held in Wuzhen , Zhejiang . Wales said that this is the first time they met, there is no consensus on specific issues, but "meet and know each other". Wales told Lu Wei how Wikipedia and Wikimedia work in the world, and expressed the hope to establish regular meeting mechanism with Lu Wei and Cyberspace Administration of China in the future. A reporter asked if he would order Wikipedia to hide some information to maintain stable operations in China, he responded "never." [28] But even Jimmy Wales' own words have been censored: he said that the improvements in machine translation might make it "no longer possible" for authorities to control flows of information in the future during a panel discussion. However, in official translation, which turned out to be that this kind of improvements will help governments to better analyze online communications. [29]

France
In April 2013, a Wikipedia article describing the Pierre-sur-Haute military radio station attracted attention from the French interior intelligence agency DCRI . The agency attempted to have the article about the facility removed from the French language Wikipedia . The DCRI pressured Rémi Mathis , a volunteer administrator of the French language Wikipedia and resident of France, into deleting the article. [30] [31] The Wikimedia Foundation asked the DCRI which parts of the article were causing a problem, noting that the article closely reflected information in a 2004 documentary made by Télévision Loire 7 , a French local television station, which is freely available online. [30] [32] The DCRI refused to give these details, and repeated its demand for deletion of the article. According to a statement issued by Wikimédia France on 6 April 2013:
Later, the article was restored by another Wikipedia contributor who lived outside France. [33] [34] As a result of the controversy, the article became the most read page on the French Wikipedia, [35] with over 120,000-page views during the weekend of 6/7 April 2013. [36] It was translated into multiple other languages. [37] The French newspaper 20 minutes , [38] Ars Technica , [35] and a posting on Slashdot , [39] noted it as an example of the Streisand effect in action. The French Ministry of the Interior told the Agence France-Presse that it did not wish to comment on the incident. [40]
According to a judicial source quoted in an AFP story on 8 April, the article's deletion "was performed as part of a preliminary inquiry" led by the "anti-terrorist section of the Paris prosecutor's office" on the grounds that the French language Wikipedia article compromised "classified material related to the chain of transmission for nuclear launch orders". [41]
Following the incident, Télévision Loire 7 said that it expected that the DCRI would request that it take down the original 2004 report on which the Wikipedia article was based, though it had been filmed and broadcast with the full cooperation of the French armed forces. [42] The National Union of Police Commissaires suggested that the next step would be for the judiciary to order French Internet service providers to block access to the Wikipedia article. [43] However, the France-based NGO Reporters Without Borders criticised the DCRI's actions as "a bad precedent". The organisation's spokesperson told Le Point that, "if the institution considers that secret defence information has been released, it has every opportunity to be recognised by the courts in arguing and clarifying its application. It is then up to the judge, the protector of fundamental freedoms, to assess the reality and extent of military secrecy." The spokesperson noted that the information contained in the article had come from a documentary that had previously been filmed and distributed with the cooperation of the army, and that the hosts and intermediaries should not be held responsible. [44]

Iran
In a November 2013 report published by the Center for Global Communication Studies of the University of Pennsylvania , researchers Collin Anderson and Nima Nazeri scanned 800,000 Persian language Wikipedia articles and found that the Iranian government blocks 963 of these pages. According to the authors, "Censors repeatedly targeted Wikipedia pages about government rivals, minority religious beliefs, and criticisms of the state, officials, and the police. Just under half of the blocked Wiki-pages are biographies, including pages about individuals the authorities have allegedly detained or killed." [45] Anderson said that Persian Wikipedia, as a microcosm of the Iranian internet, is a "useful place to uncover the types of online content forbidden and an excellent template to identify keyword blocking themes and filtering rules that apply across the greater internet." [46] In May 2014, according to Mashable , the Iranian government blocked at least two pages on the Farsi Wikipedia . [47]
According to Reporters Without Borders , the Iranian government has blocked access to Kurdish Wikipedia for extended periods of time. [48]

Italy
On 4 October 2011, following a decision adopted by the community, the contents of the Italian version of Wikipedia were hidden and the website was blocked by its administrators, as a protest against paragraph 29 of the " DDL intercettazioni " (Wiretapping Bill). [49] The proposed bill would empower anyone who believes themselves to have been offended by the content of a web site to enforce publication of a reply, uneditable and uncommented, on the same web site, within 48 hours and without any prior evaluation of the claim by a judge or to face a €12,000 fine.
On 4, 5 and 6 October, all pages on the Italian version of Wikipedia redirected to a statement opposing the proposed legislation. [50] On 7 October, the Italian Wikipedia pages were again available, but a notice about the proposed legislation was still displayed at the top of pages.

Pakistan
For seven hours on 31 March 2006, the entire domain of Wikipedia.org was blocked in Pakistan because one article contained information pertaining to the controversial cartoons of Muhammad . [51] [52] [53]
The English version of Wikipedia was blocked in Pakistan for several days in May 2010 during the controversy surrounding Everybody Draw Mohammed Day . [54] [55]

Russia
On 5 April 2013, it was confirmed by a spokesperson for the Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media (also known as Roskomnadzor) that Wikipedia had been blacklisted over the article " Cannabis Smoking " on Russian Wikipedia. [56] [57] [58]
On 18 August 2015, an article in Russian Wikipedia about charas ( Чарас ), a type of cannabis, was blacklisted by Roskomnadzor (executing an order of a provincial court issued two months earlier) as containing detailed description on making narcotics. [59] Wikipedia argued that article was originally written using UN materials and textbooks, but on 24 August it was included in the list of forbidden materials, sent to Internet providers of Russia. As Wikipedia uses HTTPS protocol, effectively all the site with all language versions of Wikipedia could be blocked in Russia from the night on 25 August. [60] According to the reports, there were intermittent blocking of Russian non-mobile version in certain regions, but mobile version continued to operate. [61] In the morning on 25 August Roskomnadzor excluded the article from the list of forbidden materials, saying that "We have been informed by the Federal Drug Control Service that sufficient edits were made to met the conditions of court order". [62] According to Wikimedia Russia director, the page was quickly edited by Wikipedia volunteers to avoid violations of the law, and maybe 10-20% of Russian users felt issues with Wikipedia access at the night of 25th. [63]

Saudi Arabia
On 11 July 2006, the Saudi government blocked access to Google and Wikipedia for its sexual and politically sensitive content. [64] [65] Many articles from the English and Arabic Wikipedia projects are censored in Saudi Arabia. [66]

Syria
Access to the Arabic Wikipedia was blocked in Syria between 30 April 2008 and 13 February 2009, although other language editions remained accessible. [67] [68]

Tunisia
The Wikimedia website was inaccessible from Tunisia between 23 and 27 November 2006. [69]

Turkey
In the early hours of 29 April 2017, monitoring group Turkey Blocks identified loss of access to all language editions of Wikipedia throughout Turkey. [70] [71] The administrative measure came after Turkish authorities asked Wikipedia to "remove content by writers supporting terror and of linking Turkey to terror groups," a request to which the government did not receive a satisfactory reply. [72]
Before, Turkey had only censored specific articles on the Turkish Wikipedia , such as "Kadın üreme organları" (vulva), "insan penisi" (human penis), "2015 Türkiye genel seçim anketleri" (2015 Turkey general election polls) "vajina" (vagina) and "testis torbası" (scrotum). There was no court decision for this censorship. One of the Internet providers, TTNET, speculated that Wikipedia was broken. Katherine Maher from the Wikimedia Foundation said this did not reflect the truth. [73]

United Kingdom
In December 2008, the Internet Watch Foundation , a UK-based non-government organization , added the Wikipedia article Virgin Killer to its internet blacklist due to the cover image and the illegality of child pornography ; the image had been assessed as the lowest level of legal concern: "erotic posing with no sexual activity". [74] As a result, people using many major UK ISPs were blocked from viewing the entire article by the Cleanfeed system, [74] [75] [76] and a large part of the UK was blocked from editing Wikipedia owing to the means used by the IWF to block the image. Following discussion, representations by the Wikimedia Foundation, [77] and public complaints, [78] the IWF reversed their decision three days later, and confirmed that in future they would not block copies of the image that were hosted overseas. [79]

Uzbekistan
The entire Wikipedia was briefly blocked twice in Uzbekistan, in 2007 and 2008. [80] Blocking of the Uzbek Wikipedia caught the attention of the international press in late February 2012. [81] Internet users in Uzbekistan trying to access Uzbek-language pages were redirected to MSN . Users in Uzbekistan could easily open Wikipedia articles in other languages. Only Uzbek-language articles were blocked. [82]
As of October 2016, the Uzbek Wikipedia is available for Uzbekistan users when the HTTPS protocol is used.

Oxford Internet Institute
The Oxford Internet Institute ( OII ) is a multi-disciplinary department, part of the University of Oxford , England . It is housed over three sites on St Giles in Oxford , including a primary site at 1 St Giles, owned by Balliol College . The department undertakes research and teaching devoted to understanding life online, with the aim of shaping Internet research, policy, and practice.
Founded in 2001, the OII has tracked the Internet's development and use, aiming to shed light on individual, collective and institutional behaviour online. The department brings together academics from a wide range of disciplines including political science, sociology, geography, economics, philosophy and physics and employs a diverse array of methods and data sources to study digital life.
Professor William H. Dutton served as Director of the OII from 2001 to 2011. Professor Helen Margetts has served as Director since 2011. [1]

Research
Research at the OII covers a huge variety of topics, with faculty publishing journal articles and books on issues including privacy and security , e-government and e-democracy , virtual economies , smart cities , digital exclusion, digital humanities , online gaming, big data and Internet geography . The OII currently has the following research clusters reflecting the diverse expertise of faculty:

Studies of Wikipedia
OII has published several studies in Internet geography and Wikipedia. In November 2011, the Guardian Data Blog published maps of geotagged Wikipedia articles written in English, Arabic , Egyptian Arabic , French , Hebrew and Persian . [2] OII Senior Research Fellow Mark Graham [3] led the study and published the results on his blog, Zero Geography . [4] Graham also leads an OII project focused on how new users are perceived, represented, and incorporated into the Wikipedia community. [5] In 2013, OII researchers published a study of controversial topics in 10 different language versions of Wikipedia, using data related to "edit wars". [6] As of late, the OII has, amongst other things, been involved in research on the effects of computational propaganda, the ethics of big data in different contexts and the political implications of the Internet and social media. It closely collaborates with other institutions of the University of Oxford such as the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, the department for computer science and the Oxford Martin School.

Teaching
Since 2006, the OII has offered a DPhil (doctoral) degree in "Information, Communication, and the Social Sciences." [7] Since 2009, it has offered a one-year Master of Science (MSc) degree in "Social Science of the Internet". [8] From 2015, prospective students can apply to study the MSc degree part-time over two years. [9] In addition, the department also runs an annual Summer Doctoral Programme which brings outstanding PhD students to study at the OII for two weeks each July. [10]

History
The Oxford Internet Institute was made possible by a major donation from The Shirley Foundation of over £10m, with public funding totalling over £5m from the Higher Education Funding Council for England .
The idea originated with Derek Wyatt MP, was quickly espoused by Colin Lucas, Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University, and Andrew Graham, then Master-Elect of Balliol. Two Balliol Fellows, who knew Dame Stephanie from The Worshipful Company of Information Technologists, approached Dame Stephanie for support.

Croatia
Coordinates : 45°10′N 15°30′E ﻿ / ﻿ 45.167°N 15.500°E ﻿ / 45.167; 15.500
Croatia ( i / k r oʊ ˈ eɪ ʃ ə / kroh- AY -shə ; Croatian : Hrvatska [xř̩ʋaːtskaː] ), officially the Republic of Croatia (Croatian: Republika Hrvatska , listen ( help · info ) ), is a sovereign state between Central Europe, Southeast Europe, and the Mediterranean . Its capital city is Zagreb , which forms one of the country's primary subdivisions , along with its twenty counties . Croatia covers 56,594 square kilometres (21,851 square miles) and has diverse, mostly continental and Mediterranean climates . Croatia's Adriatic Sea coast contains more than a thousand islands . The country's population is 4.28 million, most of whom are Croats , with the most common religious denomination being Roman Catholicism .
The Croats arrived in the area of present-day Croatia during the early part of the 7th century AD. They organised the state into two duchies by the 9th century. Tomislav became the first king by 925, elevating Croatia to the status of a kingdom. The Kingdom of Croatia retained its sovereignty for nearly two centuries, reaching its peak during the rule of Kings Petar Krešimir IV and Dmitar Zvonimir . Croatia entered a personal union with Hungary in 1102. In 1527, faced with Ottoman conquest , the Croatian Parliament elected Ferdinand I of the House of Habsburg to the Croatian throne. In 1918, after World War I , Croatia was included in the unrecognized State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs which seceded from Austria-Hungary and merged into the Kingdom of Yugoslavia . A fascist Croatian puppet state backed by Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany existed during World War II . After the war, Croatia became a founding member and a federal constituent of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , a constitutionally socialist state . On 25 June 1991 Croatia declared independence , which came wholly into effect on 8 October of the same year. The Croatian War of Independence was fought successfully during the four years following the declaration.
A unitary state , Croatia is a republic governed under a parliamentary system . The International Monetary Fund classified Croatia as an emerging and developing economy, and the World Bank identified it as a high-income economy . Croatia is a member of the European Union (EU), United Nations (UN), the Council of Europe , NATO , the World Trade Organization (WTO) and a founding member of the Union for the Mediterranean . As an active participant in the UN peacekeeping forces , Croatia has contributed troops to the NATO-led mission in Afghanistan and took a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council for the 2008–2009 term.
The service sector dominates Croatia's economy, followed by the industrial sector and agriculture. Tourism is a significant source of revenue during the summer, with Croatia ranked the 18th most popular tourist destination in the world. The state controls a part of the economy, with substantial government expenditure. The European Union is Croatia's most important trading partner . Since 2000, the Croatian government constantly invests in infrastructure, especially transport routes and facilities along the Pan-European corridors . Internal sources produce a significant portion of energy in Croatia ; the rest is imported. Croatia provides a universal health care system and free primary and secondary education , while supporting culture through numerous public institutions and corporate investments in media and publishing .

Etymology
The name of Croatia derives from Medieval Latin Croātia – compare DUX CRUATORVM [ sic ] ("Duke of the Croats") attested in the Branimir inscription – itself a derivation of North-West Slavic * Xrovat- , by liquid metathesis from proposed Common Slavic period * Xorvat , from proposed Proto-Slavic * Xarwāt- ( *Xъrvatъ ) or * Xŭrvatŭ ( *xъrvatъ ). [7]
The origin of the name is uncertain, but is thought to be a Gothic or Indo-Aryan term assigned to a Slavic tribe . [8] The oldest preserved record of the Croatian ethnonym *xъrvatъ is of variable stem, attested in the Baška tablet in style zvъnъmirъ kralъ xrъvatъskъ (" Zvonimir , Croatian king"). [9]
The first attestation of the Latin term is attributed to a charter of Duke Trpimir from the year 852. The original is lost, and just a 1568 copy is preserved—leading to doubts over the authenticity of the claim. [10] The oldest preserved stone inscription is the 9th-century Branimir Inscription (found near Benkovac ), where Duke Branimir is styled as Dux Cruatorvm . The inscription is not believed to be dated accurately, but is likely to be from during the period of 879–892, during Branimir's rule. [11]

History

Prehistory and antiquity
The area known as Croatia today was inhabited throughout the prehistoric period . Fossils of Neanderthals dating to the middle Palaeolithic period have been unearthed in northern Croatia, with the most famous and the best presented site in Krapina . [12] Remnants of several Neolithic and Chalcolithic cultures were found in all regions of the country. [13] The largest proportion of the sites is in the river valleys of northern Croatia, and the most significant cultures whose presence was discovered include Starčevo , Vučedol and Baden cultures . [14] [15] The Iron Age left traces of the early Illyrian Hallstatt culture and the Celtic La Tène culture . [16]

Greek and Roman rule
Much later, the region was settled by Liburnians and Illyrians , while the first Greek colonies were established on the islands of Korčula , Hvar [17] and Vis . [18] In 9 AD the territory of today's Croatia became part of the Roman Empire . Emperor Diocletian built a large palace in Split when he retired in AD 305. [19]
During the 5th century, one of the last Emperors of the Western Roman Empire , Julius Nepos , ruled his small empire from the palace. [20] The period ends with Avar and Croat invasions in the first half of the 7th century and destruction of almost all Roman towns. Roman survivors retreated to more favourable sites on the coast, islands and mountains. The city of Dubrovnik was founded by such survivors from Epidaurum . [21]
The ethnogenesis of Croats is uncertain and there are several competing theories, Slavic and Iranian being the most frequently put forward. The most widely accepted of these, the Slavic theory, proposes migration of White Croats from the territory of White Croatia during the Migration Period . Conversely, the Iranian theory proposes Iranian origin, based on Tanais Tablets containing Greek inscription of given names Χορούαθ[ος] , Χοροάθος and Χορόαθος (Khoroúathos, Khoroáthos, and Khoróathos) and their interpretation as anthroponyms of Croatian people. [22]

Middle Ages
According to the work De Administrando Imperio written by the 10th-century Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII , the Croats had arrived in what is today Croatia in the early 7th century; however, that claim is disputed and competing hypotheses date the event between the 6th and the 9th centuries. [23] Eventually two dukedoms were formed— Duchy of Pannonia and Duchy of Croatia , ruled by Liudewit and Borna , as attested by chronicles of Einhard starting in 818. The record represents the first document of Croatian realms, vassal states of Francia at the time. [24]
The Frankish overlordship ended during the reign of Mislav two decades later. [25] According to the Constantine VII Christianization of Croats began in the 7th century, but the claim is disputed and generally Christianization is associated with the 9th century. [26] The first native Croatian ruler recognised by the Pope was Duke Branimir, who received papal recognition from Pope John VIII on 7 June 879. [11]
Tomislav was the first ruler of Croatia who was styled a king in a letter from the Pope John X , dating kingdom of Croatia to year 925. Tomislav defeated Hungarian and Bulgarian invasions , spreading the influence of Croatian kings. [27] The medieval Croatian kingdom reached its peak in the 11th century during the reigns of Petar Krešimir IV (1058–1074) and Dmitar Zvonimir (1075–1089). [28] When Stjepan II died in 1091 ending the Trpimirović dynasty, Ladislaus I of Hungary claimed the Croatian crown in name of his sister Helena , wife of King Dmitar Zvonimir. Opposition to the claim led to a war and personal union of Croatia and Hungary in 1102, ruled by Coloman . [29]
For the next four centuries, the Kingdom of Croatia was ruled by the Sabor (parliament) and a Ban (viceroy) appointed by the king. [30] The period saw increasing threat of Ottoman conquest and struggle against the Republic of Venice for control of coastal areas. The Venetians gained control over most of Dalmatia by 1428, with exception of the city-state of Dubrovnik which became independent. Ottoman conquests led to the 1493 Battle of Krbava field and 1526 Battle of Mohács , both ending in decisive Ottoman victories. King Louis II died at Mohács, and in 1527, the Croatian Parliament met in Cetin and chose Ferdinand I of the House of Habsburg as new ruler of Croatia, under the condition that he provide protection to Croatia against the Ottoman Empire while respecting its political rights. [30] [31] This period saw the rise of influential nobility such as the Frankopan and Zrinski families to prominence and ultimately numerous Bans from the two families. [32]

Habsburg Monarchy and Austria-Hungary (1538–1918)
Following the decisive Ottoman victories, Croatia was split into civilian and military territories, with the partition formed in 1538. The military territories would become known as the Croatian Military Frontier and were under direct Imperial control. Ottoman advances in the Croatian territory continued until the 1593 Battle of Sisak , the first decisive Ottoman defeat, and stabilisation of borders. [31]
During the Great Turkish War (1683–1698), Slavonia was regained but western Bosnia , which had been part of Croatia before the Ottoman conquest, remained outside Croatian control. [31] The present-day border between the two countries is a remnant of this outcome. Dalmatia , the southern part of the border, was similarly defined by the Fifth and the Seventh Ottoman–Venetian Wars . [33]
The Ottoman wars instigated great demographic changes. Croats migrated towards Austria and the present-day Burgenland Croats are direct descendants of these settlers. [34] To replace the fleeing population, the Habsburgs encouraged the Christian populations of Bosnia and Serbia to provide military service in the Croatian Military Frontier. Serb migration into this region peaked during the Great Serb Migrations of 1690 and 1737–39. [35]
The Croatian Parliament supported Emperor Charles's Pragmatic Sanction and signed their own Pragmatic Sanction in 1712. [36] Subsequently, the emperor pledged to respect all privileges and political rights of Kingdom of Croatia and the empress Maria Theresa made significant contributions to Croatian matters.
Between 1797 and 1809 the First French Empire gradually occupied the entire eastern Adriatic coastline and a substantial part of its hinterland, ending the Venetian and the Ragusan republics, establishing the Illyrian Provinces . [31] In response the Royal Navy started the blockade of the Adriatic Sea leading to the Battle of Vis in 1811. [37] The Illyrian Provinces were captured by the Austrians in 1813, and absorbed by the Austrian Empire following the Congress of Vienna in 1815. This led to formation of the Kingdom of Dalmatia and restoration of the Croatian Littoral to the Kingdom of Croatia, now both under the same crown. [38] The 1830s and 1840s saw romantic nationalism inspire the Croatian National Revival , a political and cultural campaign advocating the unity of all South Slavs in the empire. Its primary focus was the establishment of a standard language as a counterweight to Hungarian , along with the promotion of Croatian literature and culture. [39] During the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 Croatia sided with the Austrians, Ban Josip Jelačić helping defeat the Hungarian forces in 1849, and ushering a period of Germanization policy. [40]
By the 1860s, failure of the policy became apparent, leading to the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 and creation of a personal union between the crowns of the Austrian Empire and the Kingdom of Hungary . The treaty left the issue of Croatia's status to Hungary, and the status was resolved by the Croatian–Hungarian Settlement of 1868, when kingdoms of Croatia and Slavonia were united. [41] The Kingdom of Dalmatia remained under de facto Austrian control, while Rijeka retained the status of Corpus separatum introduced in 1779. [29]
After Austria-Hungary occupied Bosnia and Herzegovina following the 1878 Treaty of Berlin , the Croatian Military Frontier was abolished and the territory returned to Croatia in 1881, [31] pursuant to provisions of the Croatian-Hungarian settlement. [42] [43] Renewed efforts to reform Austria-Hungary , entailing federalisation with Croatia as a federal unit, were stopped by advent of World War I . [44]

Yugoslavia (1918–1991)
On 29 October 1918 the Croatian Parliament ( Sabor ) declared independence and decided to join the newly formed State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs , [30] which in turn entered into union with the Kingdom of Serbia on 4 December 1918 to form the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes . [45] The Croatian Parliament never ratified a decision to unite with Serbia and Montenegro. [30] The 1921 constitution defining the country as a unitary state and abolition of Croatian Parliament and historical administrative divisions effectively ended Croatian autonomy. The new constitution was opposed by the most widely supported national political party—the Croatian Peasant Party (HSS) led by Stjepan Radić . [46]
The political situation deteriorated further as Radić was assassinated in the National Assembly in 1928, leading to the dictatorship of King Alexander in January 1929. [47] The dictatorship formally ended in 1931 when the king imposed a more unitarian constitution, and changed the name of the country to Yugoslavia. [48] The HSS, now led by Vladko Maček , continued to advocate federalisation of Yugoslavia, resulting in the Cvetković–Maček Agreement of August 1939 and the autonomous Banovina of Croatia . The Yugoslav government retained control of defence, internal security, foreign affairs, trade, and transport while other matters were left to the Croatian Sabor and a crown-appointed Ban. [49]
In April 1941, Yugoslavia was occupied by Germany and Italy . Following the invasion the territory, parts of Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the region of Syrmia were incorporated into the Independent State of Croatia (NDH), a Nazi-backed puppet state . Parts of Dalmatia were annexed by Italy and the northern Croatian regions of Baranja and Međimurje were annexed by Hungary. [50] The NDH regime was led by Ante Pavelić and ultranationalist Ustaše . The regime introduced anti-semitic laws and conducted a campaign of ethnic cleansing and genocide against Serb and Roma inhabitants of the NDH, exemplified by the Jasenovac and Stara Gradiška concentration camps. [51]
It is estimated that out of 39,000 Jews in the country only 9,000 survived; the rest were either killed or deported to Germany, both by the local authorities and the German Army itself. [52] Croatian and Serbian sources disagree on the exact figures. [53]
Furthermore, a significant number of Serbs were killed by the Ustaše on the territory of the NDH during the war. According to Midlarsky, the number of Serbs killed by the regime was at least half a million, [54] but the figure is contradicted by Bogoljub Kočović and Vladimir Žerjavić . Kočović estimated total number of Serbs killed throughout Yugoslav territory in various circumstances at 487,000, while Žerjavić put the figure at 530,000. Žerjavić indicated that 320,000 Serbs were killed in the NDH, including 82,000 killed among the Yugoslav Partisans, 23,000 killed as Axis collaborators, 25,000 victims of typhoid epidemic, 45,000 killed by Germans and 15,000 by Italians. Kočović's and Žerjavić's total Yugoslav losses are in agreement with estimates made by Mayers and Campbell of the United States Census Bureau . [55] The number of Croats killed in the NDH is estimated to be approximately 200,000, either by the Croatian fascist regime, as members of the armed resistance, or as Axis collaborators . [53] [56] Several thousand of these were killed by the Chetniks; most Croatian historians place the number of Croats killed by the Chetniks on the territory of modern-day Croatia at between 3,000 and 3,500. Croatian estimates for the number of Croats killed by Chetniks in the whole of Yugoslavia range from 18,000 to 32,000 (both combatants and civilians). [57]
A resistance movement soon emerged. On 22 June 1941, [58] the 1st Sisak Partisan Detachment was formed near Sisak , as the first military unit formed by a resistance movement in occupied Europe . [59] This sparked the beginning of the Yugoslav Partisan movement, a communist multi-ethnic anti-fascist resistance group led by Josip Broz Tito . [60] The movement grew rapidly and at the Tehran Conference in December 1943 the Partisans gained recognition from the Allies . [61]
With Allied support in logistics, equipment, training and air power, and with the assistance of Soviet troops taking part in the 1944 Belgrade Offensive , the Partisans gained control of Yugoslavia and the border regions of Italy and Austria by May 1945, during which thousands of members of the Ustaše, as well as Croat refugees, were killed by the Yugoslav Partisans. [62]
The political aspirations of the Partisan movement were reflected in the State Anti-fascist Council for the National Liberation of Croatia , which developed in 1943 as the bearer of Croatian statehood and later transformed into the Parliament of Croatia in 1945, and AVNOJ —its counterpart at the Yugoslav level. [63] [64]
After World War II , Croatia became a single-party socialist federal unit of the SFR Yugoslavia , ruled by the Communists , but enjoying a degree of autonomy within the federation. In 1967, Croatian authors and linguists published a Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Standard Language demanding greater autonomy for Croatian language . [65] The declaration contributed to a national movement seeking greater civil rights and decentralization of the Yugoslav economy, culminating in the Croatian Spring of 1971, suppressed by Yugoslav leadership. [66] Still, the 1974 Yugoslav Constitution gave increased autonomy to federal units, basically fulfilling a goal of the Croatian Spring, and providing a legal basis for independence of the federative constituents. [67]
Following the death of Yugoslav president Josip Broz Tito in 1980, the political situation in Yugoslavia deteriorated, with national tension fanned by the 1986 Serbian SANU Memorandum and the 1989 coups in Vojvodina, Kosovo and Montenegro . [68] [69] In January 1990, the Communist Party fragmented along national lines, with the Croatian faction demanding a looser federation. [70] In the same year, the first multi-party elections were held in Croatia, with Franjo Tuđman 's win raising nationalist tensions further. [71] Some of Serbs in Croatia left Sabor and declared the autonomy of areas that would soon become the unrecognised Republic of Serbian Krajina , intent on achieving independence from Croatia. [72] [73]

Independence (1991–present)
As tensions rose, Croatia declared independence on 25 June 1991; however, the full implementation of declaration only came into effect on 8 October 1991. [74] [75] In the meantime, tensions escalated into overt war when the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) and various Serb paramilitary groups attacked Croatia. [76] By the end of 1991, a high-intensity conflict fought along a wide front reduced Croatia to control of only about two-thirds of its territory. [77] [78] The various Serb paramilitary groups then began pursuing a campaign of killing, terror and expulsion against the non-Serb population in the rebel territories, killing hundreds of Croat civilians and forcing a further 170,000 from their homes. [79]
On 15 January 1992, Croatia gained diplomatic recognition by the European Economic Community members, and subsequently the United Nations. [80] [81] The war effectively ended in August 1995 with a decisive victory by Croatia. [82] This was accompanied by the exodus of about 200,000 Serbs from the rebel territories, whose lands were subsequently settled by Croat refugees from Bosnia and Herzegovina. [83] The remaining occupied areas were restored to Croatia pursuant to the Erdut Agreement of November 1995, with the process concluded in January 1998. [84] Croatia became a World Trade Organization (WTO) member on 30 November 2000. The country signed a Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA) with the European Union in October 2001. Croatia became a member of NATO on 1 April 2009, and joined the European Union on 1 July 2013.

Geography
Croatia is located in Central and Southeast Europe, bordering Hungary to the northeast, Serbia to the east, Bosnia and Herzegovina to the southeast, Montenegro to the southeast, the Adriatic Sea to the southwest and Slovenia to the northwest. It lies mostly between latitudes 42° and 47° N and longitudes 13° and 20° E . Part of the territory in the extreme south surrounding Dubrovnik is a practical exclave connected to the rest of the mainland by territorial waters , but separated on land by a short coastline strip belonging to Bosnia and Herzegovina around Neum . [85]
The territory covers 56,594 square kilometres (21,851 square miles), consisting of 56,414 square kilometres (21,782 square miles) of land and 128 square kilometres (49 square miles) of water. It is the 127th largest country in the world. [86] Elevation ranges from the mountains of the Dinaric Alps with the highest point of the Dinara peak at 1,831 metres (6,007 feet) near the border with Bosnia and Herzegovina in the south [86] to the shore of the Adriatic Sea which makes up its entire southwest border. Insular Croatia consists of over a thousand islands and islets varying in size, 48 of which are permanently inhabited . The largest islands are Cres and Krk , [86] each of them having an area of around 405 square kilometres (156 square miles).
The hilly northern parts of Hrvatsko Zagorje and the flat plains of Slavonia in the east (which is part of the Pannonian Basin ) are traversed by major rivers such as Sava , Drava , Kupa and Danube . The Danube, Europe's second longest river, runs through the city of Vukovar in the extreme east and forms part of the border with Serbia. The central and southern regions near the Adriatic coastline and islands consist of low mountains and forested highlands. Natural resources found in the country in quantities significant enough for production include oil, coal, bauxite, low-grade iron ore, calcium, gypsum, natural asphalt, silica, mica, clays, salt and hydropower. [86]
Karst topography makes up about half of Croatia and is especially prominent in the Dinaric Alps. [87] There are a number of deep caves in Croatia , 49 of which are deeper than 250 m (820.21 ft), 14 of them deeper than 500 m (1,640.42 ft) and three deeper than 1,000 m (3,280.84 ft). Croatia's most famous lakes are the Plitvice lakes , a system of 16 lakes with waterfalls connecting them over dolomite and limestone cascades. The lakes are renowned for their distinctive colours, ranging from turquoise to mint green, grey or blue. [88]

Climate
Most of Croatia has a moderately warm and rainy continental climate as defined by the Köppen climate classification . Mean monthly temperature ranges between −3 °C (27 °F ) (in January) and 18 °C (64 °F) (in July). The coldest parts of the country are Lika and Gorski Kotar where snowy forested climate is found at elevations above 1,200 metres (3,900 feet). The warmest areas of Croatia are at the Adriatic coast and especially in its immediate hinterland characterised by the Mediterranean climate , as the temperature highs are moderated by the sea. Consequently, temperature peaks are more pronounced in the continental areas—the lowest temperature of −35.5 °C (−31.9 °F) was recorded on 3 February 1919 in Čakovec , and the highest temperature of 42.4 °C (108.3 °F) was recorded on 5 July 1950 in Karlovac . [89]
Mean annual precipitation ranges between 600 millimetres (24 inches) and 3,500 millimetres (140 inches) depending on geographic region and prevailing climate type. The least precipitation is recorded in the outer islands (Vis, Lastovo , Biševo , Svetac ) and in the eastern parts of Slavonia; however, in the latter case, it occurs mostly during the growing season . The maximum precipitation levels are observed on the Dinara mountain range and in Gorski kotar. [89]
Prevailing winds in the interior are light to moderate northeast or southwest, and in the coastal area prevailing winds are determined by local area features. Higher wind velocities are more often recorded in cooler months along the coast, generally as bura or less frequently as sirocco . The sunniest parts of the country are the outer islands, Hvar and Korčula, where more than 2700 hours of sunshine are recorded per year, followed by the middle and southern Adriatic Sea area in general and northern Adriatic coast, all with more than 2000 hours of sunshine per year. [90]

Biodiversity
Croatia can be subdivided between a number of ecoregions because of its climate and geomorphology. The country is consequently one of the richest in Europe in terms of biodiversity. There are four types of biogeographical regions in Croatia—Mediterranean along the coast and in its immediate hinterland, Alpine in most of Lika and Gorski Kotar, Pannonian along Drava and Danube, and continental in the remaining areas. One of the most significant are karst habitats which include submerged karst, such as Zrmanja and Krka canyons and tufa barriers, as well as underground habitats.
The karst geology harbours approximately 7,000 caves and pits, some of which are habitat of the only known aquatic cave vertebrate —the olm . Forests are also significantly present in the country, as they cover 2,490,000 hectares (6,200,000 acres) representing 44% of Croatian land surface. Other habitat types include wetlands, grasslands, bogs, fens, scrub habitats, coastal and marine habitats. [91] In terms of phytogeography , Croatia is a part of the Boreal Kingdom and is a part of Illyrian and Central European provinces of the Circumboreal Region and the Adriatic province of the Mediterranean Region . The World Wide Fund for Nature divides Croatia between three ecoregions—Pannonian mixed forests, Dinaric Mountains mixed forests and Illyrian deciduous forests . [92]
There are 37,000 known species in Croatia, but their actual number is estimated to be between 50,000 and 100,000. [91] The claim is supported by nearly 400 new taxa of invertebrates discovered in Croatia in the first half of the 2000s (decade) alone. [91] There are more than a thousand endemic species, especially in Velebit and Biokovo mountains, Adriatic islands and karst rivers. Legislation protects 1,131 species. [91] The most serious threat to species is loss and degradation of habitats. A further problem is presented by invasive alien species, especially Caulerpa taxifolia algae.
The invasive algae are regularly monitored and removed to protect the benthic habitat . Indigenous sorts of cultivated plants and breeds of domesticated animals are also numerous. Those include five breeds of horses, five breeds of cattle, eight breeds of sheep, two breeds of pigs and a poultry breed. Even the indigenous breeds include nine endangered or critically endangered ones. [91] There are 444 protected areas of Croatia , encompassing 9% of the country. Those include eight national parks , two strict reserves, and ten nature parks . The most famous protected area and the oldest national park in Croatia is the Plitvice Lakes National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site . Velebit Nature Park is a part of the UNESCO Man and the Biosphere Programme . The strict and special reserves, as well as the national and nature parks, are managed and protected by the central government, while other protected areas are managed by counties. In 2005, the National Ecological Network was set up, as the first step in preparation of the EU accession and joining of the Natura 2000 network. [91]

Politics
The Republic of Croatia is a unitary state using a parliamentary system of governance. With the collapse of the ruling communist party in SFR Yugoslavia, Croatia organized its first multi-party elections and adopted its present constitution in 1990. [93] It declared independence on 8 October 1991 which led to the break-up of Yugoslavia and countries international recognition by the United Nations in 1992. [75] [81] Under its 1990 constitution, Croatia operated a semi-presidential system until 2000 when it switched to a parliamentary system. [94] Government powers in Croatia are divided into legislative, executive and judiciary powers. [95]
The President of the Republic ( Croatian : Predsjednik Republike ) is the head of state , directly elected to a five-year term and is limited by the Constitution to a maximum of two terms. In addition to being the commander in chief of the armed forces, the president has the procedural duty of appointing the prime minister with the consent of the parliament, and has some influence on foreign policy. [95] The most recent presidential elections were held on 11 January 2015, when Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović won. She took the oath of office on 15 February 2015. [96] The government is headed by the Prime Minister , who has four deputy prime ministers and 16 ministers in charge of particular sectors of activity. [97] As the executive branch , it is responsible for proposing legislation and a budget, executing the laws, and guiding the foreign and internal policies of the republic. The government is seated at Banski dvori in Zagreb. [95] Since 19 October 2016, Coatian Prime Minister is Andrej Plenković .
The parliament ( Sabor ) is a unicameral legislative body. A second chamber , the House of Counties , set up in 1993 pursuant to the 1990 Constitution, was abolished in 2001. The number of Sabor members can vary from 100 to 160; they are all elected by popular vote to serve four-year terms. The sessions of the Sabor take place from 15 January to 15 July, and from 15 September to 15 December. [98] The two largest political parties in Croatia are the Croatian Democratic Union and the Social Democratic Party of Croatia . [99]

Law and judicial system
Croatia has a civil law legal system in which law arises primarily from written statutes, with judges serving merely as implementers, and not creators of law. Its development was largely influenced by German and Austrian legal systems. Croatian law is divided into two principal areas – private and public law . By the time EU accession negotiations were completed on 30 June 2010, Croatian legislation was fully harmonised with the Community acquis . [100] The main law in the county is the Constitution adopted on December 22, 1990.
The main national courts are the Constitutional Court , which oversees violations of the Constitution, and the Supreme Court , which is the highest court of appeal. In addition, there are also County , Municipal, Misdemeanor, Commercial, and Administrative courts. [101] Cases falling within judicial jurisdiction are in the first instance decided by a single professional judge, while appeals are deliberated in mixed tribunals of professional judges. Lay magistrates also participate in trials. [102] State's Attorney Office is the judicial body constituted of public prosecutors that is empowered to instigate prosecution of perpetrators of offences.
Law enforcement agencies are organised under the authority of the Ministry of the Interior which consist primarily of the national police force. Croatia's security service is the Security and Intelligence Agency (SOA).

Administrative divisions
Croatia was first subdivided into counties in the Middle Ages . [103] The divisions changed over time to reflect losses of territory to Ottoman conquest and subsequent liberation of the same territory, changes of political status of Dalmatia, Dubrovnik and Istria . Traditional division of the country into counties was abolished in the 1920s, when the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes and subsequent Kingdom of Yugoslavia introduced oblasts and banovinas respectively. [104]
Communist-ruled Croatia, as a constituent part of post-World War II Yugoslavia, abolished earlier divisions and introduced municipalities, subdividing Croatia into approximately one hundred municipalities. Counties were reintroduced in 1992 legislation, significantly altered in terms of territory relative to the pre-1920s subdivisions: In 1918, the Transleithanian part of Croatia was divided into eight counties with their seats in Bjelovar , Gospić , Ogulin , Požega , Vukovar, Varaždin , Osijek and Zagreb, and the 1992 legislation established 14 counties in the same territory. [105] [106]
Since the counties were re-established in 1992, Croatia is divided into 20 counties and the capital city of Zagreb , the latter having the authority and legal status of a county and a city at the same time. Borders of the counties changed in some instances since, with the latest revision taking place in 2006. The counties subdivide into 127 cities and 429 municipalities . [107] Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) division of Croatia is performed in several tiers. NUTS 1 level places the entire country in a single unit, while there are three NUTS 2 regions. Those are Northwest Croatia, Central and Eastern (Pannonian) Croatia and Adriatic Croatia. The latter encompasses all the counties along the Adriatic coast. The Northwest Croatia includes the city of Zagreb, Zagreb, Krapina-Zagorje, Varaždin, Koprivnica-Križevci and Međimurje counties, and the Central and Eastern (Pannonian) Croatia includes the remaining areas—Bjelovar-Bilogora, Virovitica-Podravina, Požega-Slavonia, Brod-Posavina, Osijek-Baranja, Vukovar-Syrmia, Karlovac and Sisak-Moslavina counties. Individual counties and the city of Zagreb also represent NUTS 3 level subdivision units in Croatia. The NUTS Local administrative unit divisions are two-tiered. LAU 1 divisions match the counties and the city of Zagreb in effect making those the same as NUTS 3 units, while LAU 2 subdivisions correspond to the cities and municipalities of Croatia. [108]

Foreign relations
Croatia has established diplomatic relations with 174 countries. [109] As of 2009 [update] , Croatia maintains a network of 51 embassies, 24 consulates and eight permanent diplomatic missions abroad. Furthermore, there are 52 foreign embassies and 69 consulates in the Republic of Croatia in addition to offices of international organisations such as the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development , International Organization for Migration , OSCE, World Bank , World Health Organization (WHO), International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), United Nations Development Programme , United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and UNICEF . [110] In 2009, the Croatian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and European Integration employed 1,381 personnel and expended 648.2 million kuna (€86.4 million). [111] Stated aims of Croatian foreign policy include enhancing relations with neighbouring countries, developing international co-operation and promotion of the Croatian economy and Croatia itself. [112]
Since 2003, Croatian foreign policy has focused on achieving the strategic goal of becoming a member state of the European Union (EU). [113] [114] In December 2011, Croatia completed the EU accession negotiations and signed an EU accession treaty on 9 December 2011. [115] [116] Croatia joined the European Union on 1 July 2013 marking the end of a process started in 2001 by signing of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement and Croatian application for the EU membership in 2003. [117] A recurring obstacle to the negotiations was Croatia's ICTY co-operation record and Slovenian blocking of the negotiations because of Croatia–Slovenia border disputes . [118] [119] The latter was resolved through an Arbitration Agreement of 4 November 2009, approved by national parliaments and a referendum in Slovenia. [120]
Another strategic Croatian foreign policy goal for the 2000s was NATO membership . [113] [114] Croatia was included in the Partnership for Peace in 2000, invited to NATO membership in 2008 and formally joined the alliance on 1 April 2009. [121] [122] Croatia became a member of the United Nations Security Council for the 2008–2009 term, assuming presidency in December 2008. [123] The country is preparing to join the Schengen Area . [124]

Military
The Croatian Armed Forces (CAF) consist of the Army , Navy and Air Force branches in addition to the Education and Training Command and Support Command. The CAF is headed by the General Staff , which reports to the Defence Minister , who in turn reports to the President of Croatia. According to the constitution, the President is commander-in-chief of the armed forces and in case of immediate threat during wartime he issues orders directly to the General Staff. [125]
Following the 1991–95 war defence spending and CAF size have been in constant decline. As of 2005 [update] military spending was an estimated 2.39% of the country's GDP, which placed Croatia 64th in a ranking of all countries. [86] Since 2005 the budget was kept below 2% of GDP, down from the record high of 11.1% in 1994. [126] Traditionally relying on a large number of conscripts, CAF also went through a period of reforms focused on downsizing, restructuring and professionalisation in the years prior to Croatia's accession to NATO in April 2009. According to a presidential decree issued in 2006 the CAF is set to employ 18,100 active duty military personnel, 3,000 civilians and 2,000 voluntary conscripts between the ages of 18 and 30 in peacetime. [125]
Compulsory conscription was abolished in January 2008. [86] Until 2008 military service was compulsory for men at age 18 and conscripts served six-month tours of duty, reduced in 2001 from the earlier scheme of nine-month conscription tours. Conscientious objectors could instead opt for an eight-month civilian service. [127] As of April 2011 [update] the Croatian military had 120 members stationed in foreign countries as part of United Nations-led international peacekeeping forces, including 95 serving as part of the UNDOF in the Golan Heights . [128] As of 2011 [update] an additional 350 troops serve as part of the NATO-led ISAF force in Afghanistan and another 20 with the KFOR in Kosovo. [129] [130]
Croatia also has a significant military industry sector which exported around US$120 million worth of military equipment and armament in 2010. [131] Croatian-made weapons and vehicles used by CAF include the standard sidearm HS2000 manufactured by HS Produkt and the M-84D battle tank designed by the Đuro Đaković factory . Uniforms and helmets worn by CAF soldiers are also locally produced and successfully marketed to other countries. [131]

Economy
Croatia has a high-income economy. [134] International Monetary Fund data projects that Croatian nominal GDP stands at $52 billion, or $12,405 per capita for year 2017, while purchasing power parity GDP stands at $97 billion, or $23,171 per capita. [4] According to Eurostat data, Croatian PPS GDP per capita stood at 61% of the EU average in 2012. [135]
Real GDP growth in 2007 was 6.0 per cent. [136] The average net salary of a Croatian worker in January 2017 was 5,895 HRK per month, and the average gross salary was 7,911 HRK per month. [137] As of February 2017, registered unemployment rate in Croatia was 15.3%. [138]
In 2010, economic output was dominated by the service sector which accounted for 66% of GDP, followed by the industrial sector with 27.2% and agriculture accounting for 6.8% of GDP. [139] According to 2004 data, 2.7% of the workforce were employed in agriculture, 32.8% by industry and 64.5% in services. [86] [140] The industrial sector is dominated by shipbuilding, food processing, pharmaceuticals, information technology, biochemical and timber industry. In 2010, Croatian exports were valued at 64.9 billion kuna (€8.65 billion) with 110.3 billion kuna (€14.7 billion) worth of imports. The largest trading partner is rest of the European Union. [141] More than half of Croatia's trade is with other European Union member states. [142]
Privatization and the drive toward a market economy had barely begun under the new Croatian Government when war broke out in 1991. As a result of the war, the economic infrastructure sustained massive damage, particularly the revenue-rich tourism industry. From 1989 to 1993, the GDP fell 40.5%. The Croatian state still controls a significant part of the economy, with government expenditures accounting for as much as 40% of GDP. [143] A backlogged judiciary system, combined with inefficient public administration , especially on issues of land ownership and corruption, are particular concerns. In the 2015 Corruption Perceptions Index , published by Transparency International , the country is ranked joint 50th with a score of 51, where zero denotes "highly corrupt" and 100 "very clean". [144] In June 2013, the national debt stood at 59.5% of the nation's GDP. [145]

Tourism
Tourism dominates the Croatian service sector and accounts for up to 20% of Croatian GDP. Annual tourist industry income for 2014 was estimated at €7.4 billion. [146] Its positive effects are felt throughout the economy of Croatia in terms of increased business volume observed in retail business, processing industry orders and summer seasonal employment. The industry is considered an export business, because it significantly reduces the country's external trade imbalance. [147] Since the conclusion of the Croatian War of Independence, the tourist industry has grown rapidly, recording a fourfold rise in tourist numbers, with more than 11 million tourists each year. [148] The most numerous are tourists from Germany, Slovenia, Austria, Italy and the Czech Republic as well as Croatia itself. [149] Length of a tourist stay in Croatia averages 4.9 days. [150]
The bulk of the tourist industry is concentrated along the Adriatic Sea coast. Opatija was the first holiday resort since the middle of the 19th century. By the 1890s, it became one of the most significant European health resorts. [151] Later a number of resorts sprang up along the coast and islands, offering services ranging from mass tourism to catering and various niche markets, the most significant being nautical tourism , as there are numerous marinas with more than 16 thousand berths, cultural tourism relying on appeal of medieval coastal cities and numerous cultural events taking place during the summer. Inland areas offer mountain resorts, agrotourism and spas . Zagreb is also a significant tourist destination, rivalling major coastal cities and resorts. [152]
Croatia has unpolluted marine areas reflected through numerous nature reserves and 116 Blue Flag beaches . [153] Croatia is ranked as the 18th most popular tourist destination in the world. [154] About 15% of these visitors (over one million per year) are involved with naturism , an industry for which Croatia is world famous. It was also the first European country to develop commercial naturist resorts. [155]

Infrastructure
The highlight of Croatia's recent infrastructure developments is its rapidly developed motorway network , largely built in the late 1990s and especially in the 2000s (decade). By September 2011, Croatia had completed more than 1,100 kilometres (680 miles) of motorways, connecting Zagreb to most other regions and following various European routes and four Pan-European corridors . [156] [157] [158] The busiest motorways are the A1 , connecting Zagreb to Split and the A3 , passing east–west through northwest Croatia and Slavonia. [159] A widespread network of state roads in Croatia acts as motorway feeder roads while connecting all major settlements in the country. The high quality and safety levels of the Croatian motorway network were tested and confirmed by several EuroTAP and EuroTest programs. [160] [161]
Croatia has an extensive rail network spanning 2,722 kilometres (1,691 miles), including 984 kilometres (611 miles) of electrified railways and 254 kilometres (158 miles) of double track railways. [162] The most significant railways in Croatia are found within the Pan-European transport corridors Vb and X connecting Rijeka to Budapest and Ljubljana to Belgrade, both via Zagreb. [156] All rail services are operated by Croatian Railways . [163]
There are international airports in Zagreb , Zadar , Split , Dubrovnik , Rijeka , Osijek and Pula . [164] The largest and busiest is Franjo Tuđman Airport. [165] As of January 2011, Croatia complies with International Civil Aviation Organization aviation safety standards and the Federal Aviation Administration upgraded it to Category 1 rating. [166]
The busiest cargo seaport in Croatia is the Port of Rijeka and the busiest passenger ports are Split and Zadar. [167] [168] In addition to those, a large number of minor ports serve an extensive system of ferries connecting numerous islands and coastal cities in addition to ferry lines to several cities in Italy. [169] The largest river port is Vukovar, located on the Danube, representing the nation's outlet to the Pan-European transport corridor VII. [156] [170]
There are 610 kilometres (380 miles) of crude oil pipelines in Croatia, connecting the Port of Rijeka oil terminal with refineries in Rijeka and Sisak, as well as several transhipment terminals. The system has a capacity of 20 million tonnes per year. [171] The natural gas transportation system comprises 2,113 kilometres (1,313 miles) of trunk and regional natural gas pipelines, and more than 300 associated structures, connecting production rigs, the Okoli natural gas storage facility, 27 end-users and 37 distribution systems. [172]
Croatian production of energy sources covers 85% of nationwide natural gas demand and 19% of oil demand. In 2008, 47.6% of Croatia's primary energy production structure comprised use of natural gas (47.7%), crude oil (18.0%), fuel wood (8.4%), hydro power (25.4%) and other renewable energy sources (0.5%). In 2009, net total electrical power production in Croatia reached 12,725 GWh and Croatia imported 28.5% of its electric power energy needs. [85] The bulk of Croatian imports are supplied by the Krško Nuclear Power Plant , 50% owned by Hrvatska elektroprivreda , providing 15% of Croatia's electricity. [173]

Demographics
With its estimated population of 4,20 million in 2015, Croatia ranks 125th by population in the world. Its population density stands at 75.9 inhabitants per square kilometre. The overall life expectancy in Croatia at birth was 78 years in 2012. [174] The total fertility rate of 1.5 children per mother, is one of the lowest in the world . Since 1991, Croatia's death rate has continuously exceeded its birth rate . [85] Since the late 1990s, there has been a positive net migration into Croatia, reaching a level of more than 7,000 net immigrants in 2006. [175] According to the 2013 United Nations report, 17.6% of Croatia's population were foreign-born immigrants. [176]
The Croatian Bureau of Statistics forecast that the population may shrink to 3.1 million by 2051, depending on actual birth rate and the level of net migration. [177] The population of Croatia rose steadily from 2.1 million in 1857 until 1991, when it peaked at 4.7 million, with exception of censuses taken in 1921 and 1948, i.e. following two world wars. [85] The natural growth rate of the population is currently negative [86] with the demographic transition completed in the 1970s. [178] In recent years, the Croatian government has been pressured each year to add 40% to work permit quotas for foreign workers. [179] In accordance with its immigration policy, Croatia is trying to entice emigrants to return. [180]
The population decrease was also a result of the Croatian War of Independence. During the war, large sections of the population were displaced and emigration increased. In 1991, in predominantly Serb areas, more than 400,000 Croats and other non-Serbs were either removed from their homes by the Croatian Serb forces or fled the violence. [181] During the final days of the war in 1995, more than 120,000 Serbs, [182] and perhaps as many as 200,000, [183] fled the country before arrival of Croatian forces during Operation Storm. Within a decade following the end of the war, only 117,000 Serb refugees returned out of 300,000 displaced during the entire war. [184] Most of Croatia's remaining Serbs never lived in areas occupied in the Croatian War of Independence. Serbs have been only partially re-settled in the regions they previously inhabited while some of the settlements previously inhabited by Serbs were settled by Croat refugees from Bosnia and Herzegovina, mostly from Republika Srpska . [185] [186]
Croatia is inhabited mostly by Croats (90.4%) and is ethnically the most homogeneous of the six countries of former Yugoslavia. Minority groups include Serbs (4.4%), Bosniaks , Hungarians , Italians, Slovenes , Germans , Czechs , Romani people and others (5.9%). [1]

Religion
Croatia has no official religion. Freedom of religion is a right defined by the Constitution which also defines all religious communities as equal in front of the law and separated from the state .
According to the 2011 census, 91.36% of Croatians identify as Christian; of these, Roman Catholics make up the largest group, accounting for 86.28% of the population, after which follows Eastern Orthodoxy (4.44%), Protestantism (0.34%) and other Christianity (0.30%). Second largest religion is Islam (1.47%). 4.57% of the population describes themselves as non-religious. [188] The majority of Croatians consider religion to be important in their daily lives. [189]

Languages
Croatian is the official language of Croatia, and became the 24th official language of the European Union upon its accession in 2013. [191] [192] Minority languages are in official use in local government units where more than a third of population consists of national minorities or where local legislation defines so. Those languages are Czech , Hungarian , Italian , Ruthenian , Serbian and Slovakian . [193]
According to the 2011 Census, 95.6% of citizens of Croatia declared Croatian as their native language, 1.2% declared Serbian as their native language, while no other language is represented in Croatia by more than 0.5% of native speakers among population of Croatia. [194] Croatian is one of the three standard varieties of the Serbo-Croatian language of the South Slavic group of languages. Croatian is written using the Latin alphabet. Croatia has three major dialects of Serbo-Croatian represented, with standard Croatian based on the Shtokavian dialect . The Chakavian and Kajkavian dialects are distinguished by their lexicon , phonology , and syntax . [195]
From 1961 to 1991, the official language was Serbo-Croatian . Even during socialist rule , Croats often referred to their language as Croato-Serbian (instead of Serbo-Croatian) or as Croatian. [196] Croatian and Serbian variants of the language were not officially recognised as different at the time, but referred to as the west and east version, and had different alphabets: the Latin alphabet and Serbian Cyrillic . [195] Croatians are protective of their Croatian language from foreign influences, as the language was under constant change and threats imposed by previous rulers (i.e. Austrian German, Hungarian, Italian and Turkish words were changed and altered to "Slavic" looking/sounding ones). Efforts made to impose policies to alter Croatian into "Serbo-Croatian" or "South Slavic" language, met resistance from Croats in form of Croatian linguistic purism . Croatian replaced Latin as the official language of the Croatian government in the 19th century. [197]
A 2011 survey revealed that 78% of Croatians claim knowledge of at least one foreign language. [198] According to a survey ordered by the European Commission in 2005, 49% of Croatians speak English as the second language, 34% speak German, and 14% speak Italian. French and Russian are spoken by 4% each, and 2% of Croatians speak Spanish. A substantial proportion of Slovenes (59%) have a certain level of knowledge of Croatian. [199]

Education
Literacy in Croatia stands at 99.2 per cent. [200] A worldwide study about the quality of living in different countries published by Newsweek in August 2010 ranked the Croatian education system at 22nd, to share the position with Austria. [201] Primary education in Croatia starts at the age of six or seven and consists of eight grades. In 2007 a law was passed to increase free, noncompulsory education until 18 years of age. Compulsory education consists of eight grades of elementary school. Secondary education is provided by gymnasiums and vocational schools . As of 2014 [update] , there are 2,055 elementary schools and 707 schools providing various forms of secondary education. [202] Primary and secondary education are also available in languages of recognized minorities in Croatia, where classes are held in Czech, Hungarian, Italian, Serbian and German languages. [203]
There are 132 elementary and secondary level music and art schools , as well as 120 schools for disabled children and youth and 74 schools for adults. [202] Nationwide leaving exams ( Croatian : državna matura ) were introduced for secondary education students in the school year 2009–2010. It comprises three compulsory subjects (Croatian language, mathematics, and a foreign language) and optional subjects and is a prerequisite for university education. [204]
Croatia has 8 public universities, the University of Dubrovnik , University of Osijek , University of Pula , University of Rijeka , University of Split , University of Zadar and University of Zagreb , and 2 private universities, Catholic University of Croatia and Dubrovnik International University . [205] The University of Zadar, the first university in Croatia, was founded in 1396 and remained active until 1807, when other institutions of higher education took over until the foundation of the renewed University of Zadar in 2002. [206] The University of Zagreb, founded in 1669, is the oldest continuously operating university in Southeast Europe. [207] There are also 15 polytechnics , of which 2 are private, and 30 higher education institutions, of which 27 are private. [205] In total, there are 55 institutions of higher education in Croatia, attended by more than 157 thousand students. [202]
There are 205 companies, government or education system institutions and non-profit organisations in Croatia pursuing scientific research and development of technology. Combined, they spent more than 3 billion kuna (€400 million) and employed 10,191 full-time research staff in 2008. [85] Among the scientific institutes operating in Croatia, the largest is the Ruđer Bošković Institute in Zagreb. [208] The Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts in Zagreb is a learned society promoting language, culture, arts and science from its inception in 1866. [209] Croatia has also produced inventors and two Croatians received the Nobel Prize.

Health
Croatia has a universal health care system, whose roots can be traced back to the Hungarian-Croatian Parliament Act of 1891, providing a form of mandatory insurance of all factory workers and craftsmen. [210] The population is covered by a basic health insurance plan provided by statute and optional insurance. In 2012, annual healthcare related expenditures reached 21.0 billion kuna (€2.8 billion). [211] Healthcare expenditures comprise only 0.6% of private health insurance and public spending. [212] In 2010, Croatia spent 6.9% of its GDP on healthcare. [213]
Croatia ranked around the 40th in the world in life expectancy with 74 years for men and 81 years for women, and it had a low infant mortality rate of 5 per 1,000 live births . [174] [214]
There are hundreds of healthcare institutions in Croatia, including 79 hospitals and clinics with 23,967 beds. The hospitals and clinics care for more than 700 thousand patients per year and employ 5,205 medical doctors , including 3,929 specialists. There are 6,379 private practice offices, and a total of 41,271 health workers in the country. There are 63 emergency medical service units, responding to more than a million calls. The principal cause of death in 2008 was cardiovascular disease at 43.5% for men and 57.2% for women, followed by tumours, at 29.4% for men and 21.4% for women. In 2009 only 13 Croatians had been infected with HIV/AIDS and 6 had died from the disease. [85] In 2008 it was estimated by the WHO that 27.4% of Croatians over age of 15 are smokers. [215] According to 2003 WHO data, 22% of the Croatian adult population is obese. [216]

Culture
Because of its geographic position, Croatia represents a blend of four different cultural spheres. It has been a crossroad of influences of the western culture and the east—ever since division of the Western Roman Empire and the Byzantine Empire —as well as of the Mitteleuropa and the Mediterranean culture . [220] The Illyrian movement was the most significant period of national cultural history, as the 19th-century period proved crucial in emancipation of the Croatian language and saw unprecedented developments in all fields of art and culture, giving rise to a number of historical figures . [39]
The Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Croatia is tasked with preserving the nation's cultural and natural heritage and overseeing its development. Further activities supporting development of culture are undertaken at local government level. [221] The UNESCO 's World Heritage List includes seven sites in Croatia. [222] The country is also rich with Intangible culture and holds ten of UNESCO's World's intangible culture masterpieces , surpassing all countries in Europe except Spain which possesses an equal number of the listed items. [223] A global cultural contribution from Croatia is the necktie, derived from the cravat originally worn by the 17th-century Croatian mercenaries in France. [217] [218]
As of 2012 [update] , Croatia has 60 professional theatres, 17 professional children's theatres and 60 amateur theatres visited by more than 1.8 million viewers per year. The professional theatres employ 1,121 artists. There are 23 professional orchestras, ensembles and choirs in the country, attracting an annual attendance of 294 thousand. There are 162 cinemas with attendance exceeding 4 million. [224] Croatia has 175 museums, visited by nearly 2.2 million people in 2009. Furthermore, there are 1,731 libraries in the country, containing 24.5 million volumes, and 18 archives. [225]
In 2009, more than 7,200 books and brochures were published, along with 2,678 magazines and 314 newspapers. There are also 146 radio stations and 21 TV stations operating in the country. In past five years, film production in Croatia produced up to five feature films and 10 to 51 short films, with an additional 76 to 112 TV films. As of 2009 [update] , there are 784 amateur cultural and artistic associations and more than 10 thousand cultural, educational and artistic events held annually. [85] The book publishing market is dominated by several major publishers and the industry's centrepiece event— Interliber exhibition held annually at Zagreb Fair . [226]
Croatia has established a high level of human development and gender equality in terms of the Human Development Index . [227] It promotes disability rights . [228] Recognition of same-sex unions in Croatia has gradually improved over the past decade, culminating in registered civil unions in July 2014, granting same-sex couples equal inheritance rights, tax deductions and limited adoption rights. [229] However, in December 2013 Croatians voted in favour of a constitutional referendum , backed by conservative groups, defining marriage as a "life union of woman and man". [230]

Arts and literature
Architecture in Croatia reflects influences of bordering nations. Austrian and Hungarian influence is visible in public spaces and buildings in the north and in the central regions, architecture found along coasts of Dalmatia and Istria exhibits Venetian influence. [231] Large squares named after culture heroes, well-groomed parks, and pedestrian-only zones, are features of these orderly towns and cities, especially where large scale Baroque urban planning took place, for instance in Osijek ( Tvrđa ), Varaždin and Karlovac. [232] [233] Subsequent influence of the Art Nouveau was reflected in contemporary architecture. [234] Along the coast, the architecture is Mediterranean with a strong Venetian and Renaissance influence in major urban areas exemplified in works of Giorgio da Sebenico and Niccolò Fiorentino such as the Cathedral of St. James in Šibenik. The oldest preserved examples of Croatian architecture are the 9th-century churches, with the largest and the most representative among them being Donatus of Zadar . [235] [236]
Besides the architecture encompassing the oldest artworks in Croatia, there is a long history of artists in Croatia reaching to the Middle Ages. In that period the stone portal of the Trogir Cathedral was made by Radovan , representing the most important monument of Romanesque sculpture from Medieval Croatia . The Renaissance had the greatest impact on the Adriatic Sea coast since the remainder of Croatia was embroiled in the Hundred Years' Croatian–Ottoman War. With the waning of the Ottoman Empire, art flourished during the Baroque and Rococo . The 19th and the 20th centuries brought about affirmation of numerous Croatian artisans, helped by several patrons of the arts such as bishop Josip Juraj Strossmayer . [237] Croatian artists of the period achieving worldwide renown were Vlaho Bukovac and Ivan Meštrović . [235]
The Baška tablet, a stone inscribed with the glagolitic alphabet found on the Krk island and dated to 1100, is considered to be the oldest surviving prose in Croatian. [238] The beginning of more vigorous development of Croatian literature is marked by the Renaissance and Marko Marulić . Besides Marulić, Renaissance playwright Marin Držić , Baroque poet Ivan Gundulić , Croatian national revival poet Ivan Mažuranić , novelist, playwright and poet August Šenoa , children's writer Ivana Brlić-Mažuranić , writer and journalist Marija Jurić Zagorka , poet and writer Antun Gustav Matoš , poet Antun Branko Šimić , expressionist and realist writer Miroslav Krleža , poet Tin Ujević and novelist and short story writer Ivo Andrić are often cited as the greatest figures in Croatian literature. [239] [240]

Media
The freedom of the press and the freedom of speech are guaranteed by the constitution of Croatia. [241] Croatia ranked 62nd in the 2010 Press Freedom Index report compiled by Reporters Without Borders . [242] The state-owned news agency HINA runs a wire service in Croatian and English on politics, economics, society and culture. [243]
Nevertheless, despite the provisions fixed in the constitution, freedoms of press and speech in Croatia have been classified as partly free since 2000 by Freedom House , the independent nongovernmental organisation that monitors press freedom worldwide. Namely the country has been ranked 85th (of 196 countries), [244] and the 2011 Freedom House report noted improvement of applicable legislation reflecting Croatia's accession to the EU, yet pointed out instances of politicians' attempts to hinder investigative journalism and influence news reports contents, difficulties regarding public access to information , and that most of print media market is controlled by German-owned Europapress Holding and Austrian-owned Styria Media Group. [245] Amnesty International reports that in 2009 in Croatia there was an increase in the number of physical attacks and murders of journalists. The incidents were mainly perpetrated against journalists investigating war crimes and organised crime. [246]
As of October 2011, there are nine nationwide free-to-air DVB-T television channels, with Croatian Radiotelevision (HRT), Nova TV and RTL Televizija operating two of the channels each, and the remaining three operated by the Croatian Olympic Committee , Kapital Net d.o.o. and Author d.o.o. companies. In addition there are 21 regional or local DVB-T television channels. [248] The HRT is also broadcasting a satellite TV channel. [249] In 2012, there were 146 radio stations and 25 TV stations in Croatia. [250] Cable television and IPTV networks are gaining ground in the country, as the cable TV networks already serve 450 thousand people, 10% of the total population of the country. [251] [252]
There are 314 newspapers and 2,678 magazines published in Croatia. [85] The print media market is dominated by Europapress Holding and Styria Media Group who publish their flagship dailies Jutarnji list , Večernji list and 24sata . Other influential newspapers are Novi list and Slobodna Dalmacija . [253] [254] In 2013, 24sata was the most widely circulated daily newspaper, followed by Večernji list and Jutarnji list . [255]
Croatia's film industry is small and heavily subsidised by the government, mainly through grants approved by the Ministry of Culture with films often being co-produced by HRT. [256] [257] Pula Film Festival , the national film awards event held annually in Pula , is the most prestigious film event featuring national and international productions. [258] The greatest accomplishment by Croatian filmmakers was achieved by Dušan Vukotić when he won the 1961 Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film for Ersatz ( Croatian : Surogat ). [259]

Cuisine
Croatian traditional cuisine varies from one region to another. Dalmatia and Istria draw upon culinary influences of Italian and other Mediterranean cuisines which prominently feature various seafood, cooked vegetables and pasta, as well as condiments such as olive oil and garlic. The continental cuisine is heavily influenced by Hungarian , Austrian and Turkish culinary styles. In that area, meats, freshwater fish and vegetable dishes are predominant. [260]
There are two distinct wine-producing regions in Croatia. The continental region in the northeast of the country, especially Slavonia, is capable of producing premium wines, particularly whites. Along the north coast, Istrian and Krk wines are similar to those produced in neighbouring Italy, while further south in Dalmatia, Mediterranean-style red wines are the norm. [260] Annual production of wine exceeds 140 million litres. [85] Croatia was almost exclusively a wine-consuming country up until the late 18th century when a more massive production and consumption of beer started; [261] the annual consumption of beer in 2008 was 83.3 litres per capita which placed Croatia in 15th place among the world's countries. [262]

Sports
There are more than 400,000 active sportspeople in Croatia. [263] Out of that number, 277,000 are members of sports associations and nearly 4,000 are members of chess and contract bridge associations. [85] Association football is the most popular sport. The Croatian Football Federation ( Croatian : Hrvatski nogometni savez ), with more than 118,000 registered players, is the largest sporting association in the country. [264] The Prva HNL football league attracts the highest average attendance of any professional sports league in the country. In season 2010–11, it attracted 458,746 spectators. [265]
Croatian athletes competing at international events since Croatian independence in 1991 won 34 Olympic medals , including ten gold medals—at the 2012 Summer Olympics in discus throw , trap shooting , and water polo ; at the 1996 Summer Olympics and the 2004 Summer Olympics in handball, at the 2000 Summer Olympics in weightlifting and four gold medals in alpine skiing at the 2002 Winter Olympics and the 2006 Winter Olympics . [266] In addition, Croatian athletes won 13 gold medals at world championships, including two in athletics at the World Championships in Athletics held in 2007 and 2009 , one in handball at the 2003 World Men's Handball Championship , one in water polo at the 2007 World Aquatics Championships , one in rowing at the 2010 World Rowing Championships , six in alpine skiing at the FIS Alpine World Ski Championships held in 2003 and 2005 and two at the World Taekwondo Championships in 2011 and 2007 . Croatian athletes also won the 2005 Davis Cup .
Croatia hosted several major sport competitions, including the 2009 World Men's Handball Championship , the 2007 World Table Tennis Championships , the 2000 World Rowing Championships , the 1987 Summer Universiade , the 1979 Mediterranean Games and several European Championships . The governing sports authority in the country is the Croatian Olympic Committee ( Croatian : Hrvatski olimpijski odbor ), founded on 10 September 1991 and recognised by the International Olympic Committee since 17 January 1992, in time to permit the Croatian athletes to appear at the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville , France representing the newly independent nation for the first time at the Olympic Games .

Eli Pariser
Eli Pariser (born December 17, 1980) is the chief executive of Upworthy , a website for "meaningful" viral content. [1] He is a left-wing political and internet activist , the board president of MoveOn.org and a co-founder of Avaaz.org .

Career
Pariser's rise to prominence as a political activist began when he and college student David H. Pickering launched an online petition calling for a nonmilitary response to the attacks of September 11. At the time, he was working as a program assistant for the national nonprofit More Than Money. In less than a month, half a million people had signed the petition.
Pariser joined Moveon.org in November 2001, when founders Wes Boyd and Joan Blades invited him to merge his efforts with theirs. [2] [3] During the 2004 U.S. presidential campaign , Pariser co-created the Bush in 30 Seconds ad contest and raised over $30 million from small donors to run ads and back Democratic and progressive candidates. Writing for The New York Times Magazine in 2003, journalist George Packer referred to MoveOn as the "mainstream" element of what "may be the fastest-growing protest movement in American history." [2] Pariser was the Executive Director of MoveOn.org from 2004 to 2008 and since 2008 has been Board President.
Pariser later became concerned about the development of web personalization . He noticed a pattern of differing responses to search engine queries based on a user's past Internet search history, such that a person with a liberal orientation might get an entirely different set of responses than a conservative if he or she used Google , Facebook , or Yahoo to search for a phrase or term on the Internet. [4] For example, a liberal typing "BP" might get information about the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico , while a conservative typing "BP" might get investment information about the oil company. This led to his development of the concept of a filter bubble , a danger that people do not get exposed to viewpoints different from their own. [4] [5] In 2013, Pariser joined the board of advisors for tech startup State.com , creating a network of structured opinions. [6]

Cadaver
A cadaver , also called corpse (singular) in medical, literary, and legal usage, or when intended for dissection, is a deceased body . [1]

Human decay
Observation of the various stages of decomposition can help determine how long a body has been dead.

Stages of decomposition
The rate of decomposition depends on many factors including temperature and the environment. The warmer and more humid the environment, the faster the body is broken down. [2]

History
Greek physicians Herophilus (335–280 BC) and Erasistratus (c.304–c.250 BC) were among the first on record to have dissected bodies. Andreas Vesalius (1514–1564), author of De humani corporis fabrica , who was able to dispel many misconceptions by dissecting human cadavers, is regarded as the father of modern human anatomy. [3] [4]
The tradition of dissecting criminals was carried up into the eighteenth and nineteenth century when anatomy schools became popular in England and Scotland. At that time, a greater percentage of Christians believed in the literal raising from the dead. Because the souls of dissected bodies could not go to heaven, people rarely offered their bodies to science. [ citation needed ] Criminals who were executed for their crimes were used as the first cadavers. From the 16th century until 1832, and the passage of the Anatomy Act , in Britain the only cadavers legally available for dismemberment came from executed murderers. [5] The demand for cadavers increased when the number of criminals being executed decreased. Since corpses were in such high demand, it became commonplace to steal bodies from graves in order to keep the market supplied.
The methods of preserving cadavers have changed over the last 200 years. At that time, cadavers had to be used immediately because there were no adequate methods to keep the body from quickly decaying. Preservation was needed in order to carry out classes and lessons about the human body. Glutaraldehyde was the first main chemical used for embalming and preserving the body although it leaves a yellow stain in the tissues, which can interfere with observation and research.
Formaldehyde is the chemical that is used as the main embalming chemical now. It is a colorless solution that maintains the tissue in its lifelike texture and can keep the body well preserved for an extended period.

Significant News

Cadavers in science
Cadavers have contributed to body science and medical students often use cadavers to study anatomy . Cadavers are often used to verify surgical techniques before moving on to living patients. [9] While many schools have moved to using technology and surgical models to teach students, cadavers are still needed for hands on learning. Appendectomies, the removal of the appendix, are performed 28,000 times a year in the United State and are still practiced on human cadavers and not with technology simulations. [10] Gross anatomy, a common course in medical school studying the visual structures of the body, gives students the opportunity to have a hands-on learning environment. The need for cadavers has also grown outside of academic programs for research. Organizations like Science Care and the Anatomy Gifts Registry help send bodies where they are needed most. [10]

Body snatching
Anatomy schools began to steal bodies from graves. While "grave robbers" were technically people who stole jewelry from the deceased, some respected anatomy instructors dug up bodies themselves. The anatomist Thomas Sewall , who later became the personal physician for three U.S. presidents, was convicted in 1818 of digging up a corpse for dissection.
Anatomists would even dissect members of their own family. William Harvey , the man famous for discovering the circulatory system, was so dedicated he dissected his father and sister. From 1827 to 1828 in Scotland , murders were carried out, so that the bodies could be sold to medical schools for cash. These were known as the West Port murders . The Anatomy Act of 1832 was formed and passed because of the murders. H. H. Holmes , a noted serial killer in Chicago, Illinois , USA, sold the skeletons of some of his victims to medical schools.
By 1828 anatomists were paying others to do the digging. At that time, London anatomy schools employed ten full-time body snatchers and about 200 part-time workers during the dissection season. This period ran from October to May, when the winter cold slowed down the decomposition of the bodies. A crew of six or seven could dig up about 310 bodies. [ citation needed ]
Disposing of the dissected body was difficult, and rumors have appeared about how anatomists might have managed. One possibility was secretly burying the remains behind their school. Another rumored possibility was that they gave the bodies to zoo keepers, as feed for carnivorous animals or burial beneath elephant grazing pens, or fed the bodies to vultures kept specifically for this purpose.
Stories appeared of people murdering for the money they could make off cadaver sales. Two of the most famous are that of Burke and Hare, and that of Bishop, May, and Williams.
Body snatching, an act of the past, is said to be the initial controversy amongst medical ethics. Medical practice is viewed by the public as a source of treatment and healing, making the learning process overshadowed. This caused past physicians to resort to unlawful ways to fulfill their passion for knowledge. [11]

Making cars safer
Since the 1930's cadavers have been essential in making vehicles safer. Cadavers have made helped set guidelines on the safety features of vehicles ranging from laminated windshields to seat belt airbags . After the crash tests, the cadavers are taken in to get x-rayed and autopsied to examine the damage. Cadavers have helped Ford promote inflatable rear seat belts in the 2011 Explorer. [12] Cadavers can indicate how seat belts will create soft tissue damage, which is something a crash test dummy cannot do. An example that occurred in an experiment in Europe was that scientists were testing a new seat belt and thought it was unflawed.Then, after testing it on a dummy, they brought in a cadaver. They later found out that the seat belt protected the sternum, but not the pelvis. They were unable to find this out in the dummy because it did not have working parts located in the pelvic area, like the human cadaver. [13] See Crash test dummy for more information.

Embalming
When a corpse is buried, the body will decompose by the actions of anaerobic bacteria. In many countries, corpses buried in coffins are embalmed . An embalmer may prepare the corpse for a lifelike appearance. Embalming fluid is then pumped into the body via an artery (commonly carotid , or femoral ). This rehydrates the tissues and severely reduces the pace of decomposition.
Embalming is used to preserve the corpse temporarily, but may last for years. In some countries, such as the United States and Japan, make-up is applied to the corpse to prepare the body for public presentation. About 70 percent of Americans now die at hospitals or other facilities, rather than at home, and the bodies that do go through a formal viewing are preserved with embalming fluid and covered with makeup, then sealed in caskets to decompose deep underground. [14] The first step to embalming is surgical. Bodily fluids get are removed and replaced with formaldehyde-based chemicals. The second step is cosmetic. During this step the body is prepared for viewing. This process consists of styling the hair, applying make-up, and setting the facial features. The corpse is then ready to go into the coffin. The embalmers then lower the corpse into the coffin, and then lower the coffin into the grave.

Masturbation
Masturbation is the sexual stimulation of one's own genitals for sexual arousal or other sexual pleasure, usually to the point of orgasm . [1] The stimulation may involve hands, fingers , everyday objects, sex toys such as vibrators , or combinations of these. [1] [2] Mutual masturbation (mutual manual stimulation of the genitals between partners) can be a substitute for sexual penetration . Studies have found that masturbation is frequent in humans of both sexes and all ages, although there is variation. Various medical and psychological benefits have been attributed to a healthy attitude toward sexual activity in general and to masturbation in particular. No causal relationship is known between masturbation and any form of mental or physical disorder. [3]
Masturbation has been depicted in art since prehistoric times and is mentioned and discussed in very early writings. In the 18th and 19th centuries, some European theologians and physicians described it as "heinous", "deplorable", and "hideous", but during the 20th century these taboos generally declined. There has been an increase in discussion and portrayal of masturbation in art, popular music, television, films, and literature. Today, religions vary in their views of masturbation; some view it as a spiritually detrimental practice, some see it as not spiritually detrimental, and others take a situational view. The legal status of masturbation has also varied through history and masturbation in public is illegal in most countries. [4]
In the West , masturbation in private or with a partner is generally considered a normal and healthy part of sexual enjoyment. Animal masturbation has been observed in many species, both in the wild and in captivity. [5] [6] [7]

Etymology
The English word masturbation was introduced in the 18th century, based on the Latin verb masturbari , alongside the more technical and slightly earlier onanism . The Latin verb masturbari is of uncertain origin . Suggested derivations include an unattested word for penis , *mazdo , cognate with Greek mézea μέζεα , "genitals", or alternatively a corruption of an unattested *manusturpare ("to defile with the hand"), by association with turbare "to disturb". [8] [9]

Terminology
While masturbation is the formal word for this practice, many other expressions are in common use. Terms such as playing with yourself , pleasuring oneself and slang such as wanking , [10] jerking off , [11] and frigging are common. Self-abuse and self-pollution [12] were common in early modern times and are still found in modern dictionaries. A large variety of other euphemisms and dysphemisms exist which describe masturbation. For a list of terms, see the entry for masturbate in Wiktionary .

Techniques
Masturbation involves touching, pressing, rubbing or massaging a person's genital area, either with the fingers or against an object such as a pillow ; inserting fingers or an object into the vagina or anus (see anal masturbation ); and stimulating the penis or vulva with an electric vibrator , which may also be inserted into the vagina or anus. It may also involve touching, rubbing, or pinching the nipples or other erogenous zones while masturbating. Both sexes sometimes apply lubricating substances to intensify sensation.
Reading or viewing pornography , sexual fantasies , or other erotic stimuli may lead to a desire for sexual release such as by masturbation.
Some people get sexual pleasure by inserting objects, such as urethral sounds , into the urethra (the tube through which urine and, in men, semen, flows), [13] a practice known as urethral play or "sounding". [14] Other objects such as ball point pens and thermometers are sometimes used, although this practice can lead to injury and/or infection. [15] Some people masturbate by using machines that simulate intercourse.
Men and women may masturbate until they are close to orgasm , stop for a while to reduce excitement, and then resume masturbating. They may repeat this cycle multiple times. This "stop and go" build-up, known as " edging ", can achieve even stronger orgasms. [16] Rarely, people quit stimulation just before orgasm to retain the heightened energy that normally comes down after orgasm. [17]

Male
The most common masturbation technique among males is to hold the penis with a loose fist and then to move the hand up and down the shaft. This type of stimulation is typically all that is required to achieve orgasm and ejaculation . The speed of the hand motion will vary, although it is common for the speed to increase as ejaculation nears and for it to decrease during the ejaculation itself. [18]
Male masturbation techniques may differ between males who have been circumcised and those who have not. Some techniques which may work for one individual can be difficult or uncomfortable for another. For males who have not been circumcised, stimulation of the penis typically comes from the "pumping" of the foreskin , whereby the foreskin is held and slid up and down over the glans , which, depending on foreskin length, is completely or partially covered and then uncovered in a rapid motion. The outer foreskin glides smoothly over the inner foreskin. The glans itself may widen and lengthen as the stimulation continues, becoming slightly darker in colour, while the gliding action of the foreskin reduces friction. This technique may also be used by some circumcised men who have sufficient excess skin remaining from their circumcision.
For circumcised males, on whom the glans is mostly or completely uncovered, this technique creates more direct contact between the hand and the glans. To avoid friction, irritation and soreness from this resulting friction, some may prefer to use a personal lubricant, masturbation cream or saliva.
The shaft skin can also be slid back and forth with just the index finger and thumb wrapped around the penis. A variation on this is to place the fingers and thumb on the penis as if playing a flute, and then shuttle them back and forth. [18] Lying face down on a comfortable surface such as a mattress or pillow, the penis can be rubbed against it. This technique may include the use of a simulacrum , or artificial vagina .
There are many other variations on male masturbation techniques. Men may also rub or massage the glans, the rim of the glans, and the frenular delta . Some men place both hands directly on their penis during masturbation, while others may use their free hand to fondle their testicles , nipples , or other parts of their body. The nipples are erogenous zones, and vigorous stimulation of them during masturbation usually causes the penis to become erect more quickly than it would otherwise. Some may keep their hand stationary while pumping into it with pelvic thrusts in order to simulate the motions of sexual intercourse . Some may lay in the prone position and rub their genitals against the bed sheet or other surface, a technique called prone masturbation . [19] Others may also use vibrators and other sexual devices more commonly associated with female masturbation. A few extremely flexible males can reach and stimulate their penis with their tongue or lips, and so perform autofellatio .
The prostate gland is one of the organs that contributes fluid to semen . As the prostate is touch-sensitive, some directly stimulate it using a well-lubricated finger or dildo inserted through the anus into the rectum . Stimulating the prostate from outside, via pressure on the perineum , can be pleasurable as well. Some men also enjoy anal stimulation, with fingers or otherwise, without any prostate stimulation.
A somewhat controversial ejaculation control technique is to put pressure on the perineum, about halfway between the scrotum and the anus, just before ejaculating. This can, however, redirect semen into the bladder (referred to as retrograde ejaculation ).

Female
Female masturbation involves the stroking or rubbing of a woman's vulva , especially her clitoris , with an index or middle fingers , or both. Sometimes one or more fingers may be inserted into the vagina to stroke its frontal wall where the G-spot may be located. [20] Masturbation aids such as a vibrator, dildo or Ben Wa balls can also be used to stimulate the vagina and clitoris. Many women caress their breasts or stimulate a nipple with the free hand and anal stimulation is also enjoyed by some. Personal lubricant is sometimes used during masturbation, especially when penetration is involved, but this is not universal and many women find their natural lubrication sufficient.
Common positions include lying on back or face down, sitting, squatting , kneeling or standing. In a bath or shower a female may direct tap water at her clitoris and vulva. Lying face down one may use the hands, one may straddle a pillow, the corner or edge of the bed, a partner's leg or some scrunched-up clothing and " hump " the vulva and clitoris against it. Standing up, a chair, the corner of an item of furniture, or even a washing machine can be used to stimulate the clitoris through the labia and clothing. Some masturbate only using pressure applied to the clitoris without direct contact, for example by pressing the palm or ball of the hand against underwear or other clothing. In the 1920s, Havelock Ellis reported that turn-of-the-century seamstresses using treadle-operated sewing machines could achieve orgasm by sitting near the edge of their chairs. [21]
Women can sexually stimulate themselves by crossing their legs tightly and clenching the muscles in their legs, creating pressure on the genitals. This can potentially be done in public without observers noticing. Thoughts, fantasies, and memories of previous instances of arousal and orgasm can produce sexual excitation. Some women can orgasm spontaneously by force of will alone, although this may not strictly qualify as masturbation as no physical stimulus is involved. [22] [23]

Mutual masturbation
Mutual masturbation involves two or more people who sexually stimulate each other, usually with the hands. It can be practiced by people of any sexual orientation , and can be part of other sexual activity. It may be used as foreplay , or as an alternative to sexual penetration. When used as an alternative to penile-vaginal penetration, the goal may be to preserve virginity or to avoid risk of pregnancy. [24] [25]
Mutual masturbation can be practiced in pairs or groups with or without actually touching another person for example:

Frequency, age, and sex
Frequency of masturbation is determined by many factors, e.g., one's resistance to sexual tension , hormone levels influencing sexual arousal , sexual habits, peer influences, health and one's attitude to masturbation formed by culture; E. Heiby and J. Becker examined the latter. [27] Medical causes have also been associated with masturbation. [28] [29] [30]
Different studies have found that masturbation is frequent in humans. Alfred Kinsey's 1950s studies on US population have shown that 92% of men and 62% of women have masturbated during their lifespan. [23] Similar results have been found in a 2007 British national probability survey. It was found that, between individuals aged 16 to 44, 95% of men and 71% of women masturbated at some point in their lives. 73% of men and 37% of women reported masturbating in the four weeks before their interview, while 53% of men and 18% of women reported masturbating in the previous seven days. [31]
The Merck Manual says that 97% of men and 80% of women have masturbated and that, generally speaking, males masturbate more than females. [32]
Masturbation is considered normal when performed by children, [33] [34] [35] even in early infancy. [28] In 2009, the Sheffield NHS Health Trust issued a pamphlet called "Pleasure" which discussed the health benefits of masturbation. This was done in response to data and experience from the other EU member states to reduce teen pregnancy and STIs (STDs) , and to promote healthy habits. [36]
In the book Human Sexuality: Diversity in Contemporary America , by Strong, Devault and Sayad, the authors point out, "A baby boy may laugh in his crib while playing with his erect penis". "Baby girls sometimes move their bodies rhythmically, almost violently, appearing to experience orgasm." Italian gynecologists Giorgio Giorgi and Marco Siccardi observed via ultrasound a female fetus possibly masturbating and having what appeared to be an orgasm. [37]
Popular belief asserts that individuals of either sex who are not in sexually active relationships tend to masturbate more frequently than those who are; however, much of the time this is not true as masturbation alone or with a partner is often a feature of a relationship. Contrary to this belief, several studies actually reveal a positive correlation between the frequency of masturbation and the frequency of intercourse. A study has reported a significantly higher rate of masturbation in gay men and women who were in a relationship. [31] [38] [39] [40]
Coon and Mitterer stated: "Approximately 70 percent of married women and men masturbate at least occasionally." [41]

Evolutionary utility
Female masturbation alters conditions in the vagina, cervix and uterus, in ways that can alter the chances of conception from intercourse, depending on the timing of the masturbation. A woman's orgasm between one minute before and 45 minutes after insemination favors the chances of that sperm reaching her egg. If, for example, she has had intercourse with more than one male, such an orgasm can increase the likelihood of a pregnancy by one of them. [42] [43] Female masturbation can also provide protection against cervical infections by increasing the acidity of the cervical mucus and by moving debris out of the cervix. [43]
In males, masturbation flushes out old sperm with low motility from the male's genital tract. The next ejaculate then contains more fresh sperm, which have higher chances of achieving conception during intercourse. If more than one male has intercourse with a female, the sperm with the highest motility will compete more effectively. [44] [45] [46]

Health effects
The medical consensus is that masturbation is a medically healthy and psychologically normal habit. [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] According to the Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy , "It is considered abnormal only when it inhibits partner-oriented behavior, is done in public, or is sufficiently compulsive to cause distress." [55]
In the US, masturbation was a diagnosable psychological condition until DSM II (1968). [56] The American Medical Association consensually declared masturbation as normal in 1972. [57]
Masturbation does not deplete one's body of energy. [58] Masturbation does not produce premature ejaculation . [59]

General benefits
Sex therapists will sometimes recommend that female patients take time to masturbate to orgasm, for example to help improve sexual health and relationships, to help determine what is erotically pleasing to them, and because mutual masturbation can lead to more satisfying sexual relationships and added intimacy. [60] [61]
It is held in many mental health circles that masturbation can relieve depression and lead to a higher sense of self-esteem . [62] Masturbation can also be particularly useful in relationships where one partner wants more sex than the other – in which case masturbation provides a balancing effect and thus a more harmonious relationship. [63]
Mutual masturbation, the act by which two or more partners stimulate themselves in the presence of each other, allows a couple to reveal the "map to [their] pleasure centers". By watching a partner masturbate, one finds out the methods they use to please him- or herself, allowing each partner to learn exactly how the other enjoys being touched. Intercourse, by itself, is often inconvenient or impractical at times to provide sufficient sexual release for many people. Mutual masturbation allows couples to enjoy each other and obtain sexual release as often as they need but without the inconveniences and risks associated with sex. [63]
In 2003, an Australian research team led by Graham Giles of The Cancer Council Australia [64] found that males masturbating frequently had a lower probability to develop prostate cancer . Men who averaged five or more ejaculations weekly in their 20s had significantly lower risk. However they could not show a direct causation. The study also indicated that increased ejaculation through masturbation rather than intercourse would be more helpful as intercourse is associated with diseases (STDs) that may increase the risk of cancer instead. However, this benefit may be age related. A 2008 study concluded that frequent ejaculation between the ages of 20 and 40 may be correlated with higher risk of developing prostate cancer. On the other hand, frequent ejaculation in one's 50s was found to be correlated with a lower such risk in this same study. [65]
A study published in 1997 found an inverse association between death from coronary heart disease and frequency of orgasm even given the risk that myocardial ischaemia and myocardial infarction can be triggered by sexual activity.
That is, a difference in mortality appeared between any two subjects when one subject ejaculated at around two times per week more than the other. Assuming a broad range average of between 3 and 5 ejaculations per week for healthy males, this would mean 5 to 7 ejaculations per week. This is consistent with a 2003 Australia article on the benefits against prostate cancer. The strength of these correlations increased with increasing frequency of ejaculation. [66]
A 2008 study at Tabriz Medical University found ejaculation reduces swollen nasal blood vessels, freeing the airway for normal breathing. The mechanism is through stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system and is long lasting. The study author suggests "It can be done [from] time-to-time to alleviate the congestion and the patient can adjust the number of intercourses or masturbations depending on the severity of the symptoms." [67]
Solo masturbation is a sexual activity that is free of risk of sexually transmitted infections . With two or more participants, the risk of sexually transmitted infections, while not eliminated, is much less than with most forms of penetrative sex . Support for such a view, and for making masturbation part of the American sex education curriculum, led to the dismissal of US Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders during the Clinton administration . Some EU Nations promote masturbation in their sex education curricula.
Sexual climax, from masturbation or otherwise, leaves one in a relaxed and contented state. This is frequently followed closely by drowsiness and sleep – particularly when one masturbates in bed. [68] [69] [70]
Some professionals consider masturbation to function as a cardiovascular workout. [71] Though research is still as yet scant, those suffering from cardiovascular disorders (particularly those recovering from myocardial infarction, or heart attacks) should resume physical activity (including sexual intercourse and masturbation) gradually and with the frequency and rigor which their physical status will allow. This limitation can serve as encouragement to follow through with physical therapy sessions to help improve endurance. In general, real sex slightly increases energy consumption, according to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine . [72] [73]
Both sex and masturbation lower blood pressure . A small study demonstrated lower blood pressure in persons who had recently masturbated compared to those with no proximate sexual activity. [74]

Risks
Those who insert objects as aids to masturbation risk them becoming stuck (e.g. as rectal foreign bodies ). Men and women can fall prey to this problem. A woman went into a German hospital with two pencils in her bladder, having pierced her urethra after inserting them during masturbation. [75]

Pregnancy
Solo masturbation, or masturbation involving individuals of the same sex, cannot produce pregnancy. Masturbation involving both a man and a woman (see mutual masturbation ) can result in pregnancy only if semen contacts the vulva.

Problems for males
A man whose penis has suffered a blunt trauma, severe bend or other injury during intercourse or masturbation may, rarely, sustain a penile fracture [76] [77] [78] or suffer from Peyronie's disease . [79] Phimosis is "a contracted foreskin (that) may cause trouble by hurting when an attempt is made to pull the foreskin back". [80] In these cases, any energetic manipulation of the penis can be problematic.
A small percentage of men suffer from postorgasmic illness syndrome (POIS), which can cause severe muscle pain throughout the body and other symptoms immediately following ejaculation, whether due to masturbation or partnered sex. The symptoms last for up to a week. [81] [82] [83] Some doctors speculate that the frequency of POIS "in the population may be greater than has been reported in the academic literature", [84] and that many POIS sufferers are undiagnosed. [85]

Compulsive masturbation
Compulsive masturbation and other compulsive behaviors can be signs of an emotional problem, which may need to be addressed by a mental health specialist. [86] As with any "nervous habit", it is more helpful to consider the causes of compulsive behavior, rather than try to repress masturbation. [87]
Masturbation among adolescents contributes to them developing a sense of mastery over sexual impulses, and it has a role in the physical and emotional development of prepubescents and pubescents. [88] Babies and toddlers will play with their genitals in much the same way as they play with their ears or toes. If such play becomes all-consuming, it may be necessary to look for an underlying cause of this, such as the child being tense and in need of comfort, or that others may be overreacting and thus reinforcing the habit. It could be caused by a low-grade urinary tract or yeast infection, or the child may be overstimulated and in need of soothing, or indeed understimulated and bored. Alongside many other factors, such as medical evidence, age-inappropriate sexual knowledge, sexualized play or aggression, and precocious or seductive behavior, excessive masturbation may alternatively be an indicator of sexual abuse . [89] [90]

History and society
The sexual stimulation of one's own genitals has been interpreted variously by different religions , the subject of legislation, social controversy, activism, as well as intellectual study in sexology . Social views regarding masturbation taboo have varied greatly in different cultures, and over history.
There are depictions of male and female masturbation in prehistoric rock paintings around the world. From the earliest records, ancient Sumer had a relaxed attitude toward sex, and masturbation was a popular technique for enhancing potency, either alone or with a partner. [91] [92] Male masturbation was an even more important image in ancient Egypt : when performed by a god it could be considered a creative or magical act: the god Atum was believed to have created the universe by masturbating to ejaculation. The ancient Greeks also regarded masturbation as a normal and healthy substitute for other forms of sexual pleasure. [93]
Diogenes is said to have masturbated in public, which was considered scandalous. [94] On the indecency of him masturbating in public he would say, "If only it were as easy to banish hunger by rubbing my belly." [94]
Among non-western perspectives on the matter, some teachers and practitioners of Traditional Chinese medicine, Taoist meditative and martial arts say that masturbation can cause a lowered energy level in men. Within the African Congo Basin , the Aka , Ngandu , Lesi , brbs , and Ituri ethnic groups all lack a word for masturbation in their languages and are confused by the concept of masturbation. [95]
Perspectives within the Abrahamic religions may be connected with biblical sources that are interpreted as inveighing against masturbation. [ citation needed ]

Development of the contemporary Western world view

18th Century
The first use of the word "onanism" to consistently and specifically refer to masturbation is a pamphlet first distributed in London in 1716 and attributed [ by whom? ] to Dutch theologian Dr. Balthazar Bekker , titled "Onania, or the Heinous Sin of self-Pollution, And All Its Frightful Consequences, In Both Sexes, Considered: With Spiritual and Physical Advice To Those Who Have Already Injured Themselves By This Abominable Practice." In 1743–45, the British physician Robert James published A Medicinal Dictionary , in which he described masturbation as being "productive of the most deplorable and generally incurable disorders" and stated that "there is perhaps no sin productive of so many hideous consequences". [96] One of the many horrified by the descriptions of malady in Onania was the notable Swiss physician Samuel-Auguste Tissot . In 1760, he published L'Onanisme , his own comprehensive medical treatise on the purported ill-effects of masturbation. Though Tissot's ideas are now considered conjectural at best, his treatise was presented as a scholarly, scientific work in a time when experimental physiology was practically nonexistent.

19th Century
By 1838 Jean Esquirol had declared in his Des Maladies Mentales that masturbation was "recognized in all countries as a cause of insanity." [97] [98] Doctor John Harvey Kellogg and Rev. Sylvester Graham where among those who proposed that circumcision and eating a bland, meatless diet would curb masturbation. [99] The medical literature of the time also described more invasive procedures including electric shock treatment, infibulation , restraining devices like chastity belts and straitjackets , cauterization or – as a last resort – wholesale surgical excision of the genitals.
Medical attitudes toward masturbation began to change towards the end of the 19th century when H. Havelock Ellis , in his seminal 1897 work Studies in the Psychology of Sex , questioned Tissot's premises. [100]

20th Century
In 1905, Sigmund Freud addressed masturbation in his Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality and associated it with addictive substances. He described the masturbation of infants at the period when the infant is nursing, at four years of age, and at puberty. At the same time, the supposed medical condition of hysteria —from the Greek hystera or uterus—was being treated by what would now be described as medically administered or medically prescribed masturbation for women. In 1910, the meetings of the Vienna psychoanalytic circle discussed the moral or health effects of masturbation, [101] but its publication on the matter was suppressed. Concerning Specific Forms of Masturbation is a 1922 essay by another Austrian , the psychiatrist and psychoanalyst Wilhelm Reich . In the seven and a half page essay Reich accepts the prevalent notions on the roles of unconscious fantasy and the subsequent emerging guilt feelings which he saw as originating from the act itself.
By 1930, Dr. F. W. W. Griffin , editor of The Scouter, had written in a book for Rover Scouts stating that the temptation to masturbate was "a quite natural stage of development" and, citing Ellis ' work, held that "the effort to achieve complete abstinence was a very serious error." The work of sexologist Alfred Kinsey during the 1940s and 1950s, most notably the Kinsey Reports , insisted that masturbation was an instinctive behaviour for both males and females. In the US masturbation has not been a diagnosable condition since DSM II (1968). [56]
Thomas Szasz states the shift in scientific consensus : [48] [49] [102] "Masturbation: the primary sexual activity of mankind. In the nineteenth century it was a disease; in the twentieth, it's a cure." [50]
In the 1980s Michel Foucault was arguing masturbation taboo was "rape by the parents of the sexual activity of their children". However, in 1994, when the Surgeon General of the United States , Dr. Joycelyn Elders , mentioned as an aside that it should be mentioned in school curricula that masturbation was safe and healthy, she was forced to resign, [103] with opponents asserting that she was promoting the teaching of how to masturbate.

21st Century
Both practices and cultural views of masturbation have continued to evolve in the 21st Century, partly because the contemporary lifeworld is increasingly technical. For example, digital photographs or live video may be used to share masturbatory experiences either in a broadcast format (possibly in exchange of money, as with performances by " camgirls " and " camboys "), or between members of a long-distance relationship . Teledildonics is a growing field. Masturbation has been depicted as a not-uncomplicated part of "Love in the 21st Century" in the BBC drama by the same name. [104]

Stigma
Even though many medical professionals and scientists have found large amounts of evidence that masturbating is healthy [47] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] [59] [56] and commonly practiced by males and females, stigma on the topic still persists today. In November 2013, Matthew Burdette, after being filmed masturbating, committed suicide . [105] [106] [107]

Religious views
Religions vary broadly in their views of masturbation, from considering it completely impermissible ( as in Roman Catholicism ) [109] to encouraging and refining it (as, for example, in some Neotantra and Taoist sexual practices ).

Philosophical arguments
Immanuel Kant regarded masturbation as a violation of the moral law. In The Metaphysics of Morals (1797), he made the a posteriori argument that "such an unnatural use of one's sexual attribute" strikes "everyone upon his thinking of it" as "a violation of one's duty to himself", and suggested that it was regarded as immoral even to give it its proper name (unlike the case of the similarly undutiful act of suicide). He went on, however, to acknowledge that "it is not so easy to produce a rational demonstration of the inadmissibility of that unnatural use", but ultimately concluded that its immorality lay in the fact that "a man gives up his personality … when he uses himself merely as a means for the gratification of an animal drive". [110]
Subsequent critics of masturbation tended to argue against it on more physiological grounds, however.

Law
The prosecution of masturbation has varied at different times, from virtually unlimited acceptance to complete illegality. In a 17th-century law code for the Puritan colony of New Haven, Connecticut " blasphemers , homosexuals and masturbators" were eligible for the death penalty . [111]
Often, masturbation in the sight of others is prosecuted under a general law such as public indecency , though some laws make specific mention of masturbation. In the UK, masturbating in public is illegal under Section 28 of the Town Police Clauses Act 1847. The penalty may be up to 14 days in prison, depending on a range of circumstantial factors. [112] In the US, laws vary from state to state. In 2010, the Supreme Court of Alabama upheld a state law criminalizing the distribution of sex-toys. [113] In the city of Charlotte, North Carolina, masturbating in public is a class 3 misdemeanour. [112] In 2013, a man found masturbating openly on a beach in Sweden was cleared of charges of sexual assault, the court finding that his activities had not been directed towards any specific person. [114]
In many jurisdictions, masturbation by one person of another is considered digital penetration which may be illegal in some cases, such as when the other person is a minor.
There is debate whether masturbation should be promoted in correctional institutions. Restrictions on pornography, used to accompany masturbation, are common in American correctional facilities . Connecticut Department of Corrections officials say that these restrictions are intended to avoid a hostile work environment for correctional officers . [115] Other researchers argue allowing masturbation could help prisoners restrict their sexual urges to their imaginations rather than engaging in prison rape or other non-masturbatory sexual activity that could pose sexually transmitted disease or other health risks. [116]

Cultural views and practices

Sperm donation
Male masturbation may be used as a method to obtain semen for third party reproductive procedures such as artificial insemination and in vitro fertilisation which may involve the use of either partner or donor sperm. [117] [118]
At a sperm bank or fertility clinic, a special room or cabin may be set aside so that semen may be produced by male masturbation for use in fertility treatments such as artificial insemination. Most semen used for sperm donation , and all semen donated through a sperm bank by sperm donors, is produced in this way. The facility at a sperm bank used for this purpose is known as a masturbatorium (US) or men's production room (UK). A bed or couch is usually provided for the man, and pornographic films or other material may be made available. [119]

Encouraged masturbation
In the UK in 2009, a leaflet was issued by the National Health Service in Sheffield carrying the slogan, "an orgasm a day keeps the doctor away". It also says: "Health promotion experts advocate five portions of fruit and veg a day and 30 minutes' physical activity three times a week. What about sex or masturbation twice a week?" This leaflet has been circulated to parents, teachers and youth workers and is meant to update sex education by telling older school students about the benefits of enjoyable sex. Its authors have said that for too long, experts have concentrated on the need for "safe sex" and committed relationships while ignoring the principal reason that many people have sex. The leaflet is entitled Pleasure . Instead of promoting teenage sex, it could encourage young people to delay losing their virginity until they are certain they will enjoy the experience, said one of its authors. [120] [121]
The Spanish region of Extremadura launched a programme in 2009 to encourage "sexual self-exploration and the discovery of self-pleasure" in people aged from 14 to 17. The €14,000 campaign includes leaflets, flyers, a "fanzine", and workshops for the young in which they receive instruction on masturbation techniques along with advice on contraception and self-respect. The initiative, whose slogan is, "Pleasure is in your own hands" has angered local right-wing politicians and challenged traditional Roman Catholic views. Officials from the neighbouring region of Andalucia have expressed an interest in copying the programme. [122]
The text book Palliative care nursing: quality care to the end of life states, "Terminally ill people are likely no different from the general population regarding their masturbation habits. Palliative care practitioners should routinely ask their patients if anything interferes in their ability to masturbate and then work with the patient to correct the problem if it is identified." [123]

Rites of passage
The Sambia tribe of New Guinea has rituals and rites of passage surrounding manhood which lasts several years and involves ejaculation through fellatio often several times a day. Semen is valued and masturbation is seen as a waste of semen and is therefore frowned upon even though frequent ejaculation is encouraged. The capacity and need to ejaculate is developed or nurtured for years from an early age but through fellatio so that it can be consumed rather than wasted. Semen is ingested for strength and is considered in the same line as mothers' milk. [124] [ better source needed ]
Other cultures have rites of passage into manhood that culminate in the first ejaculation of a male, usually by the hands of a tribal elder. In some tribes such as the Agta, Philippines, stimulation of the genitals is encouraged from an early age. [125] Upon puberty, the young male is then paired off with a "wise elder" or "witch doctor" who uses masturbation to build his ability to ejaculate in preparation for a ceremony. The ceremony culminates in a public ejaculation before a celebration. The ejaculate is saved in a wad of animal skin and worn later to help conceive children. In this and other tribes, the measure of manhood is actually associated more with the amount of ejaculate and his need than penis size.

Popular culture

Paintings and drawings
There are depictions of male masturbation in prehistoric rock paintings around the world. Most early people seem to have connected human sexuality with abundance in nature. [ citation needed ] A clay figurine of the 4th millennium BC from a temple site on the island of Malta depicts a woman masturbating. [126] However, in the ancient world depictions of male masturbation are far more common. [ citation needed ]

Music
In popular music, there are various songs that deal with masturbation. Some of the earliest examples are " My Ding-a-Ling " by Chuck Berry and "Mary Ann with the Shaky Hand" and " Pictures of Lily " by The Who . [127]
More recent popular songs include " Rosie " by Jackson Browne , " I Touch Myself " by the Divinyls , "Very Busy People" by The Limousines , " Dancing With Myself " by Billy Idol , " Everyday I Die " by Gary Numan , " You're Makin' Me High " by Toni Braxton , " Holding My Own " by The Darkness , " Vibe On " by Dannii Minogue , " Orgasm Addict " by the Buzzcocks , " Captain Jack " by Billy Joel , "Blister in the Sun" by Violent Femmes , " Longview " by Green Day , "M+Ms" by Blink-182 , " Wow, I Can Get Sexual Too " by Say Anything , "Fingers" and " U + Ur Hand " by P!nk , [128] " So Happy I Could Die " by Lady Gaga , "Masturbating Jimmy" by The Tiger Lillies , "When Life Gets Boring " by Gob , "Get a Grip" by Semisonic , and " Darling Nikki " by Prince . The 1983 recording " She Bop " by Cyndi Lauper , was one of the first fifteen songs ever required to carry Parental Advisory sticker for sexual content. [129] In a 1993 interview on The Howard Stern Show , Lauper claimed she recorded the vocal track in the nude. [130] Some [131] have argued that Billy Joel's song "The Stranger" is about masturbation. The song "Masturbates" by rock group Mindless Self Indulgence also deals with the concept of auto-erotic activity in a punk framework.

Literature
The 1858 schoolboys' novel Eric, or, Little by Little was a tract against masturbation, but did not mention the subject except extremely obliquely as " Kibroth-Hattaavah " a place mentioned in the Old Testament where those that lusted after meat were buried.
In October 1972, an important censorship case was held in Australia, leading to the banning of Philip Roth's novel Portnoy's Complaint in that country due to its masturbation references. The censorship led to public outcry at the time. [132]
Further portrayals and references to masturbation have occurred throughout literature, and the practice itself has even contributed to the production of literature among certain writers, such as Wolfe , Balzac , Flaubert and John Cheever . [133] Perhaps the most famous fictional depiction of masturbation occurs in the "Nausicaa" episode of Ulysses by James Joyce. Here the novel's protagonist Bloom brings himself to covert climax during a public fireworks display after being aroused by a young woman's coy exhibitionism.

Television
In the Seinfeld episode " The Contest ", [134] the show's main characters enter into a contest to see who can go the longest without masturbating. Because Seinfeld ' s network, NBC , did not think masturbation was a suitable topic for prime-time television, the word is never used. Instead, the subject is described using a series of euphemisms. "Master of my domain" became a part of the American lexicon from this episode.
Another NBC show, Late Night with Conan O'Brien , had a character known as the Masturbating Bear, a costume of a bear with a diaper covering its genitals. The Masturbating Bear would touch his diaper to simulate masturbation. Prior to leaving Late Night to become host of The Tonight Show , Conan O'Brien originally retired the character due to concerns about its appropriateness in an earlier time slot. [135] The Masturbating Bear however made his Tonight Show debut during the final days of Conan O'Brien's tenure as host of the Tonight Show . It was clear by then that Conan O'Brien was being removed from the show and he spent his last shows pushing the envelope with skits that typically would not be appropriate for the Tonight Show , one of which was the Masturbating Bear. [136] After much debate on whether or not he would be able to be used on Conan O'Brien's new TBS show, Conan , the Masturbating Bear made an appearance on the very first episode. [137]
In March 2007 the UK broadcaster Channel 4 was to air a season of television programmes about masturbation, called Wank Week . ( Wank is a Briticism for masturbate .) The series came under public attack from senior television figures, and was pulled amid claims of declining editorial standards and controversy over the channel's public service broadcasting credentials. However, its constituent films may yet be shown by the channel at a later date. [138]

Pornography
Depictions of male and female masturbation are common in pornography, including gay pornography . Am Abend (1910), one of the earliest pornographic films that have been collected at the Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction , [139] [140] starts with a female masturbation scene. Solo performances in gay pornography have been described in 1985 as "either or both active (tense, upright) and/or passive (supine, exposed, languid, available)", whereas female solo performances are said to be "exclusively passive (supine, spread, seated, squatted, orifices offered, etc.)". [141] Solo pornography recognized with AVN Awards include the All Alone series [142] and All Natural: Glamour Solos . [143]

Other animals
Masturbatory behavior has been documented in a very wide range of species. Individuals of some species have been known to create tools for masturbation purposes. [7]

Virgin Killer
Virgin Killer is the fourth studio album by German heavy metal band Scorpions . It was released in 1976 and was the band's first album to attract attention outside Europe. [1] The title is described as being a reference to time as the killer of innocence . [2] The original cover featured a nude prepubescent girl, which stirred controversy in the UK, US and elsewhere. As a result, the album was re-issued with a different cover in some countries.
In December 2008, the image again gave rise to controversy when the British Internet Watch Foundation placed certain pages from Wikipedia on its internet blacklist, since it considered the image to be "potentially illegal" under the Protection of Children Act 1978 . [3] This resulted in much of the UK being prevented from editing Wikipedia, and significant public debate on the decision. The decision was reversed by the IWF after four days of blocking. [4]

Reception
The success of Virgin Killer was similar to other Scorpions albums featuring Uli Jon Roth as lead guitarist; it "failed to attain any serious attention in the United States" but was "quite popular in Japan" [6] where it peaked at number 32 in the charts. [7] The album was another step in the band's shift from psychedelic music to hard rock . [8] Critic Vincent Jeffries of Allmusic contends in hindsight that the album was "the first of four studio releases that really defined the Scorpions and their urgent metallic sound that was to become highly influential". [9] He also counts the title track and "Pictured Life" among the "all-time Scorpions standouts". Among the band members, Uli Jon Roth considers Virgin Killer and the previous release In Trance as his favourite Scorpions albums. [10]

Artwork
The original cover art for the album depicted a nude ten-year-old girl, [11] with a shattered glass effect obscuring her genitalia . The image was designed by Steffan Böhle, [12] who was then the product manager for RCA Records . [10] Francis Buchholz was the bassist for the band and, in an interview conducted in early 2007, recollects that the model depicted on the cover was either the daughter or the niece of the cover designer. [13] The photograph was taken by Michael von Gimbut. [14] The band's rhythm guitarist Rudolf Schenker offers the following description of the circumstances behind the album cover:
In a separate interview, Schenker also notes that he thought the cover art was a "great thing" and that he had "pushed the band to really stay behind it" as he felt that people would "think differently" when they looked at the lyrics and realized that the cover art was only being used as "a symbol of the lyrics". [15] In a 2008 interview, Schenker added "We would never again do something like this". [11] The band's former lead guitarist Uli Jon Roth notes that the cover art of the "old Scorpion albums" were "usually done by other people". [10] He has since expressed regret over the original album cover:
In 2008, photographer Michael von Gimbut emphasized that his wife, the model's mother and sister, and three female assistants had been present during the shooting and stated, "Back then, we loved and protected children and did not sleep with them." [11]
The cover generated controversy: the album could only be sold sealed in black plastic in several countries [11] and the cover was replaced in some countries with an alternative cover art depicting the band members. [8] The original is named in various "worst album cover" lists: Cracked magazine online named it the No. 1 "Worst Album Cover of All-Time", [17] while Gigwise.com lists it as No. 1 on its March 2008 "The 50 Most Controversial Album Covers of All Time!" list. Similarly, it was named by UGO Networks one of the "Weirdest Album Covers" [18] and placed No. 6 on the "All-Time Worst Album Covers" list made by two.one.five magazine. [19]
This would not be the last time that the band attracted controversy with its album covers. Their next album, Taken by Force , originally featured cover art that depicted "children playing with guns at a military cemetery in France and some people found that offensive". [10] Their 1979 album Lovedrive featured a "bizarre artwork" that depicts "a woman on the back seat of a car with bubblegum over her breast". [8] Both covers were replaced by an alternative design. [20] [21] Vocalist Klaus Meine explains that the band's penchant for controversial cover art stems from a desire "to go over the edge" and not "to offend some people or make the headlines [as] that would be stupid", contrasting guitarist Rudolf Schenker's earlier statement, "We're using this only to get attention." [1] [2] In a 2010 interview Meine commented on the cover art again stating:
In August 2015, a court in Sweden said that it considered the album cover to be child pornography. [23]

Wikipedia controversy
In May 2008, the US-based social conservative site WorldNetDaily reported the cover image on Wikipedia to the Federal Bureau of Investigation . A subsequent investigation by the FBI concluded that the artwork did not violate any US laws. [24] An officer of the Concerned Women for America , a conservative Christian advocacy group, commented that: "By allowing that image to remain posted, Wikipedia is helping to further facilitate perversion and pedophilia." [25] EContent magazine subsequently reported the Wikipedia community 's internal debate as concluding that: "Prior discussion has determined by broad consensus that the Virgin Killer cover will not be removed" and asserted that Wikipedia contributors "favour inclusion in all but the most extreme cases". [26]
In December 2008, the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), a UK-based non-government organization , added the Wikipedia article Virgin Killer to its internet blacklist due to concerns over legality of the image, which had been assessed as the lowest level of legal concern: "erotic posing with no sexual activity". [27] As a result, people using many major UK ISPs were blocked from viewing the entire article by the Cleanfeed system, [27] [28] [29] and a large part of the UK was blocked from editing Wikipedia owing to the means of blocking in use. Following representations by the Wikimedia Foundation (who host the Wikipedia website) [30] and public complaints, [31] the IWF reversed their decision three days later and confirmed that in future they would not block copies of the image that were hosted overseas. [4] The IWF stated that one of the reasons for reversing their decision was that it had increased public interest in the image, an example of the Streisand effect . [32]

Preadolescence
Preadolescence , also known as pre-teen or tween , is a stage of human development following early childhood and preceding adolescence . [1] It commonly ends with the beginning of puberty , [2] but may also be defined as ending with the start of the teenage years. [3] For example, dictionary definitions generally designate it as 10–13 years. [4] Preadolescence can bring its own challenges and anxieties .

Prepubescence, puberty and range
Being prepubescent is not the same thing as being preadolescent. Instead, prepubescent (and sometimes child ) is a term for boys and girls who have not developed secondary sex characteristics , [5] while preadolescent is generally defined as those ranging from age 10 to 13 years. [4] [6] Preadolescence may also be defined as the period from 9 to 14 years. [7] [8]
The point at which a child becomes an adolescent is defined by the onset of puberty or the beginning of the teenage stage. [2] [3] [5] Adolescence is also viewed as ending with the teenage stage. [3] However, in some individuals (particularly females), puberty begins in the preadolescence years. [9] [10] Studies indicate that the onset of puberty has been one year earlier with each generation since the 1950s. [11]
One can also distinguish middle childhood and preadolescence [7] – middle childhood from approximately 5–8 years, as opposed to the time children are generally considered to reach preadolescence. [8] There is no exact agreement as to when preadolescence starts and ends, and research by Gesell et al. suggests that "chronological time...is by no means identical with developmental time" – the duration of the "inner" stages of growth' – or with physiological time. [12]
While known as preadolescent in psychology, the terms preteen , preteenager or tween are common in everyday use. A preteen or preteenager [1] is a person 12 and under. [13] Generally, the term is restricted to those close to reaching age 12, [1] especially age 11. [14] Tween is an American neologism and marketing term [15] for preteen , which is a blend of between and teen . [13] [14] People within this age range are variously described as tweens, preadolescents, tweenies, preteens, pubescents, junior highers [16] or tweenagers. [17] [18]
The term tween was previously used in J. R. R. Tolkien 's 1954 novel The Lord of the Rings to refer to hobbits in their twenties: " tweens as hobbits called the irresponsible twenties between childhood and the coming of age at thirty-three." [19] In this context, the word is really either a shortened version of between or a portmanteau of teen and twenty , and in either case has no connection to teens, preteens or the American marketing niche.

Psychological development
Of the 'two major socializing agents in children's lives: the family environment...and formal educational institutions,' [20] it is 'the family in its function a primary socializer of the child' [21] that predominates in the first five years of life: middle childhood by contrast is characterized by 'a child's readiness for school...being self-assured and interested; knowing what kind of behavior is expected...being able to wait, to follow directions, and getting along with other children.' [22]
Preadolescent children in fact have a different view of the world from younger children in many significant ways. Typically, theirs is a more realistic view of life than the intense, fantasy-oriented world of earliest childhood. Preadolescents have more mature, sensible, realistic thoughts and actions: 'the most "sensible" stage of development...the child is a much less emotional being now.' [23] They will often have developed a sense of ' intentionality . The wish and capacity to have an impact, and to act upon that with persistence'; [24] and will have a more developed sense of looking into the future and seeing effects of their actions (as opposed to early childhood where children often do not worry about their future). This can include more realistic job expectations ("I want to be an engineer when I grow up", as opposed to "I want to be a wizard"). Middle children generally show more investment 'in control over external reality through the acquisition of knowledge and competence': [25] where they do have worries, these may be more a fear of kidnappings , rapes , and scary media events, as opposed to fantasy things (e.g., witches, monsters , ghosts).
Preadolescents may well view human relationships differently (e.g. they may notice the flawed, human side of authority figures). Alongside that, they may begin to develop a sense of self - identity , and to have increased feelings of independence : 'may feel an individual, no longer "just one of the family."' [26] A different view on morality can emerge; and the middle child will also show more cooperativeness . The ability to balance one's own needs with those of others in group activities'. [27] Many preadolescents will often start to question their home life and surroundings around this time and they may also start to form opinions that may differ from their upbringing in regards to issues such as politics , religion , sexuality , and gender roles .
Greater responsibility within the family can also appear, as middle children become responsible for younger siblings and relatives, as with babysitting ; while preadolescents may start caring about what they look like and what they are wearing.
Middle children often begin to experience infatuation , limerence , puppy love , or love itself, though arguably at least with 'girls carrying out all the romantic interest....preadolescent girls' romantic pursuits often seem to be more aggressive than affectionate.' [28]
Preadolescents may still suffer tantrums at the age of 13, sometimes leading to rash decisions regarding risky actions. Such decisions may in rare cases result in grave situations such as accidental death. [29]

Home from home
Where development has been optimal, preadolescents 'come to school for something to be added to their lives; they want to learn lessons...which can lead to their eventually working in a job like their parents.' [30] When earlier developmental stages have gone astray, however, then, on the principle that 'if you miss a stage, you can always go through it later,' [31] some middle children 'come to school for another purpose...[not] to learn but to find a home from home...a stable emotional situation in which they can exercise their own emotional liability, a group of which they can gradually become a part.' [32]

Divorce
Children at the threshold of adolescence...in the nine-to-twelve-year-old group [33] would seem to have particular vulnerabilities to parental separation. Among such problems were the very 'eagerness of these youngsters to be co-opted into the parental battling; their willingness to take sides...and the intense, compassionate, caretaking relations which led these youngsters to attempt to rescue a distressed parent often to their own detriment. [34]

Media
Preadolescents may well be more exposed to popular culture than younger children and have interests based on internet trends, television shows and movies (no longer just cartoons), fashion, technology, music and social media. Preadolescents generally prefer certain brands , and are a heavily targeted market of many advertisers. Their tendency to buy brand-name items may be due to a desire to fit in, although the desire is not as strong as it is with teenagers.
Some scholars suggest that 'pre-adolescents ... reported frequent encounters with sexual material in the media, valued the information received from it, and used it as a learning resource ... and evaluated such content through what they perceived to be sexual morality.' [35] However, other research has suggested that sexual media influences on preadolescent and adolescent sexual behavior is minimal. [36]

Freud
Freud called this stage the latency period to indicate that sexual feelings and interest went underground ... the feelings that create that first "eternal triangle" with the parents fade, and free energy for other interests and activities.' [37] Erik H. Erikson confirmed that 'violent drives are normally dormant ... a lull before the storm of puberty , when all the earlier drives re-emerge in a new combination, to be brought under the dominance of genitality.' [38]
Latency period children can then direct more of their energy into asexual pursuits such as school, athletics, and same-sex friendships: middle childhood especially is marked by 'the importance of school, teams, classes, friends, gangs and organised activities ... and the adults who run those.' [39] Nevertheless, recent research suggests that "most children do not cease sexual development, interest and behavior" at this time: rather, they "cease to share their interest with adults and are less frequently observed." [40] Because "they've learned the rules ... [they] fit in with the grown-up's belief that they're not interested. But the curiosity about it all continues, and there's quite a lot of experimenting going on between them.' [41] alongside other pursuits
But while the eight-year-old still has "years to wait until puberty, adolescence and finally sexual maturity ... a sort of lull before puberty arrives,' [42] with preadolescence proper (9–12), and the move forward from middle childhood, what have been called 'the introspective and social concerns of the prepubescent' [43] tend to come more to the fore. Clearly "few experiences are more prominent in the lives of preadolescents than the onset of puberty"; [44] so that "at eleven or twelve you're just reaching the end of a long period during which change was steady and incremental": [45] Freud's latency years.

Pedophilia
Pedophilia or paedophilia is a psychiatric disorder in which an adult or older adolescent experiences a primary or exclusive sexual attraction to prepubescent children. [1] [2] Although girls typically begin the process of puberty at age 10 or 11, and boys at age 11 or 12, [3] criteria for pedophilia extend the cut-off point for prepubescence to age 13. [1] A person who is diagnosed with pedophilia must be at least 16 years old, and at least five years older than the prepubescent child, for the attraction to be diagnosed as pedophilia. [1] [2]
Pedophilia is termed pedophilic disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM-5 ), and the manual defines it as a paraphilia involving intense and recurrent sexual urges towards and fantasies about prepubescent children that have either been acted upon or which cause the person with the attraction distress or interpersonal difficulty. [1] The International Classification of Diseases ( ICD-10 ) defines it as a sexual preference for children of prepubertal or early pubertal age. [4]
In popular usage, the word pedophilia is often applied to any sexual interest in children or the act of child sexual abuse . [5] [6] This use conflates the sexual attraction to prepubescent children with the act of child sexual abuse, and fails to distinguish between attraction to prepubescent and pubescent or post-pubescent minors . [7] [8] Researchers recommend that these imprecise uses be avoided because although people who commit child sexual abuse sometimes exhibit the disorder, [6] [9] child sexual abuse offenders are not pedophiles unless they have a primary or exclusive sexual interest in prepubescent children, [7] [10] [11] and the literature indicates the existence of pedophiles who do not molest children. [5] [12] [13]
Pedophilia was first formally recognized and named in the late 19th century. A significant amount of research in the area has taken place since the 1980s. Although mostly documented in men, there are also women who exhibit the disorder, [14] [15] and researchers assume available estimates underrepresent the true number of female pedophiles. [16] No cure for pedophilia has been developed, but there are therapies that can reduce the incidence of a person committing child sexual abuse. [6] The exact causes of pedophilia have not been conclusively established. [17] Some studies of pedophilia in child sex offenders have correlated it with various neurological abnormalities and psychological pathologies. [18] In the United States, following Kansas v. Hendricks , sex offenders who are diagnosed with certain mental disorders, particularly pedophilia, can be subject to indefinite civil commitment . [19]

Definitions
The word pedophilia comes from the Greek : παῖς, παιδός ( paîs, paidós ), meaning "child", and φιλία ( philía ), "friendly love" or "friendship". [20] Pedophilia is used for individuals with a primary or exclusive sexual interest in prepubescent children aged 13 or younger. [1] [2] Nepiophilia (from the Greek : νήπιος ( népios ) meaning "infant" or "child," which in turn derives from "ne-" and "epos" meaning "not speaking"), sometimes called infantophilia , is a sub-type of pedophilia; it is used to refer to a sexual preference for infants and toddlers (ages 0–3 or those under age 5). [9] [21] Hebephilia is defined as individuals with a primary or exclusive sexual interest in 11- to 14-year-old pubescents. [22] The DSM-5 does not list hebephilia among the diagnoses; while evidence suggests that hebephilia is separate from pedophilia, the ICD-10 includes early pubertal age (an aspect of hebephilia) in its pedophilia definition, covering the physical development overlap between the two philias. [13] In addition to hebephilia , some clinicians have proposed other categories that are somewhat or completely distinguished from pedophilia; these include pedohebephilia (a combination of pedophilia and hebephilia) and ephebophilia (though ephebophilia is not considered pathological). [23] [24]

Signs and symptoms

Development and sexual orientation
Pedophilia emerges before or during puberty, and is stable over time. [25] It is self-discovered, not chosen. [6] For these reasons, pedophilia has been described as a disorder of sexual preference, phenomenologically similar to a heterosexual or homosexual sexual orientation. [25] These observations, however, do not exclude pedophilia from the group of mental disorders because pedophilic acts cause harm, and pedophiles can sometimes be helped by mental health professionals to refrain from acting on their impulses which cause harm to children. [26]
In response to misinterpretations that the American Psychiatric Association considers pedophilia a sexual orientation because of wording in its printed DSM-5 manual, which distinguishes between paraphilia and what it calls "paraphilic disorder", subsequently forming a division of "pedophilia" and "pedophilic disorder", the association commented: "'[S]exual orientation' is not a term used in the diagnostic criteria for pedophilic disorder and its use in the DSM-5 text discussion is an error and should read 'sexual interest.'" They added, "In fact, APA considers pedophilic disorder a 'paraphilia,' not a 'sexual orientation.' This error will be corrected in the electronic version of DSM-5 and the next printing of the manual." They said they strongly support efforts to criminally prosecute those who sexually abuse and exploit children and adolescents, and "also support continued efforts to develop treatments for those with pedophilic disorder with the goal of preventing future acts of abuse." [27]

Comorbidity and personality traits
Studies of pedophilia in child sex offenders often report that it co-occurs with other psychopathologies , such as low self-esteem , [28] depression, anxiety, and personality problems. It is not clear whether these are features of the disorder itself, artifacts of sampling bias, or consequences of being identified as a sex offender. [18] One review of the literature concluded that research on personality correlates and psychopathology in pedophiles is rarely methodologically correct, in part owing to confusion between pedophiles and child sex offenders, as well as the difficulty of obtaining a representative, community sample of pedophiles. [29] Seto (2004) points out that pedophiles who are available from a clinical setting are likely there because of distress over their sexual preference or pressure from others. This increases the likelihood that they will show psychological problems. Similarly, pedophiles recruited from a correctional setting have been convicted of a crime, making it more likely that they will show anti-social characteristics. [30]
Impaired self-concept and interpersonal functioning were reported in a sample of child sex offenders who met the diagnostic criteria for pedophilia by Cohen et al. (2002), which the authors suggested could contribute to motivation for pedophilic acts. The pedophilic offenders in the study had elevated psychopathy and cognitive distortions compared to healthy community controls. This was interpreted as underlying their failure to inhibit criminal behavior. [31] Studies in 2009 and 2012 found that non-pedophilic child molesters exhibited psychopathy, but pedophiles did not. [32] [33]
Wilson and Cox (1983) studied the characteristics of a group of pedophile club members. The most marked differences between pedophiles and controls were on the introversion scale, with pedophiles showing elevated shyness, sensitivity and depression. The pedophiles scored higher on neuroticism and psychoticism , but not enough to be considered pathological as a group. The authors caution that "there is a difficulty in untangling cause and effect. We cannot tell whether paedophiles gravitate towards children because, being highly introverted, they find the company of children less threatening than that of adults, or whether the social withdrawal implied by their introversion is a result of the isolation engendered by their preference i.e., awareness of the social [dis]approbation and hostility that it evokes" (p. 324). [34] In a non-clinical survey, 46% of pedophiles reported that they had seriously considered suicide for reasons related to their sexual interest, 32% planned to carry it out, and 13% had already attempted it. [35]
A review of qualitative research studies published between 1982 and 2001 concluded that child sexual abusers use cognitive distortions to meet personal needs, justifying abuse by making excuses, redefining their actions as love and mutuality, and exploiting the power imbalance inherent in all adult–child relationships. [36] Other cognitive distortions include the idea of "children as sexual beings", uncontrollability of sexual behavior, and "sexual entitlement-bias". [37]

Child pornography
Consumption of child pornography is a more reliable indicator of pedophilia than molesting a child, [38] although some non-pedophiles also view child pornography. [39] Child pornography may be used for a variety of purposes, ranging from private sexual gratification or trading with other collectors, to preparing children for sexual abuse as part of the child grooming process. [40] [41] [42]
Pedophilic viewers of child pornography are often obsessive about collecting, organizing, categorizing, and labeling their child pornography collection according to age, gender, sex act and fantasy. [43] According to FBI agent Ken Lanning, "collecting" pornography does not mean that they merely view pornography, but that they save it, and "it comes to define, fuel, and validate their most cherished sexual fantasies". [39] Lanning states that the collection is the single best indicator of what the offender wants to do, but not necessarily of what has or will be done. [44] Researchers Taylor and Quayle reported that pedophilic collectors of child pornography are often involved in anonymous internet communities dedicated to extending their collections. [45]

Causes
Although what causes pedophilia is not yet known, researchers began reporting a series of findings linking pedophilia with brain structure and function, beginning in 2002. Testing individuals from a variety of referral sources inside and outside the criminal justice system as well as controls , these studies found associations between pedophilia and lower IQs , [46] [47] [48] poorer scores on memory tests, [47] greater rates of non-right-handedness, [46] [47] [49] [50] greater rates of school grade failure over and above the IQ differences, [51] lesser physical height, [52] [53] greater probability of having suffered childhood head injuries resulting in unconsciousness, [54] [55] and several differences in MRI -detected brain structures. [56] [57] [58] They report that their findings suggest that there are one or more neurological characteristics present at birth that cause or increase the likelihood of being pedophilic. Some studies have found that pedophiles are less cognitively impaired than non-pedophilic child molesters. [59] A 2011 study reported that pedophilic child molesters had deficits in response inhibition, but no deficits in memory or cognitive flexibility. [60] Evidence of familial transmittability "suggests, but does not prove that genetic factors are responsible" for the development of pedophilia. [61] A 2015 study indicated that pedophilic offenders have a normal IQ. [62]
Another study, using structural MRI , indicated that male pedophiles have a lower volume of white matter than a control group . [56] Functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) has indicated that child molesters diagnosed with pedophilia have reduced activation of the hypothalamus as compared with non-pedophilic persons when viewing sexually arousing pictures of adults. [63] A 2008 functional neuroimaging study notes that central processing of sexual stimuli in heterosexual "paedophile forensic inpatients" may be altered by a disturbance in the prefrontal networks, which "may be associated with stimulus-controlled behaviours, such as sexual compulsive behaviours". The findings may also suggest "a dysfunction at the cognitive stage of sexual arousal processing". [64]
Blanchard, Cantor, and Robichaud (2006) reviewed the research that attempted to identify hormonal aspects of pedophiles. [65] They concluded that there is some evidence that pedophilic men have less testosterone than controls, but that the research is of poor quality and that it is difficult to draw any firm conclusion from it.
While not causes of pedophilia themselves, childhood abuse by adults or comorbid psychiatric illnesses—such as personality disorders and substance abuse —are risk factors for acting on pedophilic urges. [6] Blanchard, Cantor, and Robichaud addressed comorbid psychiatric illnesses that, "The theoretical implications are not so clear. Do particular genes or noxious factors in the prenatal environment predispose a male to develop both affective disorders and pedophilia, or do the frustration, danger, and isolation engendered by unacceptable sexual desires—or their occasional furtive satisfaction—lead to anxiety and despair?" [65] They indicated that, because they previously found mothers of pedophiles to be more likely to have undergone psychiatric treatment, [54] the genetic possibility is more likely.
A study analyzing the sexual fantasies of 200 heterosexual men by using the Wilson Sex Fantasy Questionnaire exam determined that males with a pronounced degree of paraphilic interest (including pedophilia) had a greater number of older brothers, a high 2D:4D digit ratio (which would indicate low prenatal androgen exposure), and an elevated probability of being left-handed , suggesting that disturbed hemispheric brain lateralization may play a role in deviant attractions. [66]

Diagnosis

DSM and ICD-10
The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5th edition (DSM-5) has a significantly larger diagnostic features section for pedophilia than the previous DSM version, the DSM-IV-TR , and states, "The diagnostic criteria for pedophilic disorder are intended to apply both to individuals who freely disclose this paraphilia and to individuals who deny any sexual attraction to prepubertal children (generally age 13 years or younger), despite substantial objective evidence to the contrary." [1] Like the DSM-IV-TR, the manual outlines specific criteria for use in the diagnosis of this disorder. These include the presence of sexually arousing fantasies, behaviors or urges that involve some kind of sexual activity with a prepubescent child (with the diagnostic criteria for the disorder extending the cut-off point for prepubescence to age 13) for six months or more, or that the subject has acted on these urges or suffers from distress as a result of having these feelings. The criteria also indicate that the subject should be 16 or older and that the child or children they fantasize about are at least five years younger than them, though ongoing sexual relationships between a 12- to 13-year-old and a late adolescent are advised to be excluded. A diagnosis is further specified by the sex of the children the person is attracted to, if the impulses or acts are limited to incest , and if the attraction is "exclusive" or "nonexclusive". [1]
The ICD-10 defines pedophilia as "a sexual preference for children, boys or girls or both, usually of prepubertal or early pubertal age". [4] Like the DSM, this system's criteria require that the person be at least 16 years of age or older before being diagnosed as a pedophile. The person must also have a persistent or predominant sexual preference for prepubescent children at least five years younger than them. [2]
Several terms have been used to distinguish "true pedophiles" from non-pedophilic and non-exclusive offenders, or to distinguish among types of offenders on a continuum according to strength and exclusivity of pedophilic interest, and motivation for the offense (see child sexual offender types ). Exclusive pedophiles are sometimes referred to as true pedophiles. They are sexually attracted to prepubescent children, and only prepubescent children. Showing no erotic interest in adults, they can only become sexually aroused while fantasizing about or being in the presence of prepubescent children, or both. [16] Non-exclusive offenders—or "non-exclusive pedophiles"—may at times be referred to as non-pedophilic offenders, but the two terms are not always synonymous. Non-exclusive offenders are sexually attracted to both children and adults, and can be sexually aroused by both, though a sexual preference for one over the other in this case may also exist. If the attraction is a sexual preference for prepubescent children, such offenders are considered pedophiles in the same vein as exclusive offenders. [4] [16]
Neither the DSM nor the ICD-10 diagnostic criteria require actual sexual activity with a prepubescent youth. The diagnosis can therefore be made based on the presence of fantasies or sexual urges even if they have never been acted upon. On the other hand, a person who acts upon these urges yet experiences no distress about their fantasies or urges can also qualify for the diagnosis. Acting on sexual urges is not limited to overt sex acts for purposes of this diagnosis, and can sometimes include indecent exposure , voyeuristic or frotteuristic behaviors, [1] or masturbating to child pornography . [38] Often, these behaviors need to be considered in-context with an element of clinical judgment before a diagnosis is made. Likewise, when the patient is in late adolescence, the age difference is not specified in hard numbers and instead requires careful consideration of the situation. [67]
Ego-dystonic sexual orientation ( F66.1 ) includes people who acknowledge that they have a sexual preference for prepubertal children, but wish to change it due to the associated psychological or behavioral problems (or both).

Debate regarding criteria
The DSM-IV-TR criteria was criticized simultaneously for being over-inclusive, as well as under-inclusive. [68] Though most researchers distinguish between child molesters and pedophiles, [10] [11] [13] [68] Studer and Aylwin argue that the DSM criteria are over-inclusive because all acts of child molestation warrant the diagnosis. A child molester satisfies criteria A because of the behavior involving sexual activity with prepubescent children and criteria B because the individual has acted on those urges. [68] Furthermore, they argue that it also is under-inclusive in the case of individuals who do not act upon it and are not distressed by it. [68] The latter point has also been made by several other researchers who have remarked that a so-called "contented pedophile"—an individual who fantasizes about having sex with a child and masturbates to these fantasies, but does not commit child sexual abuse, and who does not feel subjectively distressed afterward—does not meet the DSM-IV-TR criteria for pedophilia, because this person does not meet Criterion B. [13] [69] [70] [71] A large-scale survey about usage of different classification systems showed that the DSM classification is only rarely used. As an explanation, it was suggested that the under-inclusiveness, as well as a lack of validity, reliability and clarity might have led to the rejection of the DSM classification. [12]
Ray Blanchard , an American-Canadian sexologist known for his research studies on pedophilia, addressed (in his literature review for the DSM-5) the aforementioned objections to the DSM-IV-TR, and proposed a general solution applicable to all paraphilias. This meant namely a distinction between paraphilia and paraphilic disorder . The latter term is proposed to identify the diagnosable mental disorder which meets Criterion A and B, whereas an individual who does not meet Criterion B can be ascertained but not diagnosed as having a paraphilia. [72] Blanchard and a number of his colleagues also proposed that hebephilia become a diagnosable mental disorder under the DSM-5 to resolve the physical development overlap between pedophilia and hebephilia by combining the categories under pedophilic disorder , but with specifiers on which age range (or both) is the primary interest. [23] [73] The proposal for hebephilia was rejected by the American Psychiatric Association, [74] but the distinction between paraphilia and paraphilic disorder was implemented. [1] [75]
The American Psychiatric Association stated that "[i]n the case of pedophilic disorder, the notable detail is what wasn't revised in the new manual. Although proposals were discussed throughout the DSM-5 development process, diagnostic criteria ultimately remained the same as in DSM-IV TR" and that "[o]nly the disorder name will be changed from pedophilia to pedophilic disorder to maintain consistency with the chapter’s other listings." [75] If hebephilia had been accepted as a DSM-5 diagnosable disorder, it would have been similar to the ICD-10 definition of pedophilia that already includes early pubescents, [13] and would have raised the minimum age required for a person to be able to be diagnosed with pedophilia from 16 years to 18 years (with the individual needing to be at least 5 years older than the minor). [23]
O'Donohue, however, suggests that the diagnostic criteria for pedophilia be simplified to the attraction to children alone if ascertained by self-report, laboratory findings, or past behavior. He states that any sexual attraction to children is pathological and that distress is irrelevant, noting "this sexual attraction has the potential to cause significant harm to others and is also not in the best interests of the individual." [76] Also arguing for behavioral criteria in defining pedophilia, Howard E. Barbaree and Michael C. Seto disagreed with the American Psychiatric Association's approach in 1997 and instead recommended the use of actions as the sole criterion for the diagnosis of pedophilia, as a means of taxonomic simplification. [77]

Treatment

General
There is no evidence that pedophilia can be cured. [13] Instead, most therapies focus on helping the pedophile refrain from acting on their desires. [6] [78] Some therapies do attempt to cure pedophilia, but there are no studies showing that they effect a long-term change in sexual preference. [79] Michael Seto suggests that attempts to cure pedophilia in adulthood are unlikely to succeed because its development is influenced by prenatal factors. [13] Fred Berlin , founder of the Johns Hopkins Sexual Disorders Clinic, believes that pedophilia may be no easier to alter than homosexuality or heterosexuality, [80] but that pedophiles can be helped to control their behavior, and future research could develop a method of prevention. [81]
There are several common limitations to studies of treatment effectiveness. Most categorize their participants by behavior rather than erotic age preference, which makes it difficult to know the specific treatment outcome for pedophiles. [6] Many do not select their treatment and control groups randomly . Offenders who refuse or quit treatment are at higher risk of offending, so excluding them from the treated group, while not excluding those who would have refused or quit from the control group, can bias the treated group in favor of those with lower recidivism. [13] [82] The effectiveness of treatment for non-offending pedophiles has not been studied. [13]

Cognitive behavioral therapy
Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) aims to reduce attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors that may increase the likelihood of sexual offenses against children. Its content varies widely between therapists, but a typical program might involve training in self-control, social competence and empathy, and use cognitive restructuring to change views on sex with children. The most common form of this therapy is relapse prevention , where the patient is taught to identify and respond to potentially risky situations based on principles used for treating addictions. [83]
The evidence for cognitive behavioral therapy is mixed. [83] A 2012 Cochrane Review of randomized trials found that CBT had no effect on risk of reoffending for contact sex offenders. [84] Meta-analyses in 2002 and 2005, which included both randomized and non-randomized studies, concluded that CBT reduced recidivism. [85] [86] There is debate over whether non-randomized studies should be considered informative. [13] [87] More research is needed. [84]

Behavioral interventions
Behavioral treatments target sexual arousal to children, using satiation and aversion techniques to suppress sexual arousal to children and covert sensitization (or masturbatory reconditioning) to increase sexual arousal to adults. [88] Behavioral treatments appear to have an effect on sexual arousal patterns during phallometric testing, but it is not known whether the effect represents changes in sexual interests or changes in the ability to control genital arousal during testing, nor whether the effect persists in the long term. [89] [90] For sex offenders with mental disabilities, applied behavior analysis has been used. [91]

Sex drive reduction
Pharmacological interventions are used to lower the sex drive in general, which can ease the management of pedophilic feelings, but does not change sexual preference. [92] Antiandrogens work by interfering with the activity of testosterone. Cyproterone acetate (Androcur) and medroxyprogesterone acetate (Depo-Provera) are the most commonly used. The efficacy of antiantrogens has some support, but few high-quality studies exist. Cyproterone acetate has the strongest evidence for reducing sexual arousal, while findings on medroxyprogesterone acetate have been mixed. [93]
Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues such as leuprolide acetate (Lupron), which last longer and have fewer side-effects, are also used to reduce libido, [94] as are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors . [93] The evidence for these alternatives is more limited and mostly based on open trials and case studies. [13] All of these treatments, commonly referred to as " chemical castration ", are often used in conjunction with cognitive behavioral therapy. [95] According to the Association for the Treatment of Sexual Abusers , when treating child molesters, "anti-androgen treatment should be coupled with appropriate monitoring and counseling within a comprehensive treatment plan." [96] These drugs may have side-effects, such as weight gain, breast development, liver damage and osteoporosis. [13]
Historically, surgical castration was used to lower sex drive by reducing testosterone. The emergence of pharmacological methods of adjusting testosterone has made it largely obsolete, because they are similarly effective and less invasive. [92] It is still occasionally performed in Germany, the Czech Republic, Switzerland, and a few U.S. states. Non-randomized studies have reported that surgical castration reduces recidivism in contact sex offenders. [97] The Association for the Treatment of Sexual Abusers opposes surgical castration [96] and the Council of Europe works to bring the practice to an end in Eastern European countries where it is still applied through the courts. [98]

Epidemiology

Pedophilia and child molestation
The prevalence of pedophilia in the general population is not known, [13] [30] but is estimated to be lower than 5% among adult men. [13] Less is known about the prevalence of pedophilia in women, but there are case reports of women with strong sexual fantasies and urges towards children. [14] Most sexual offenders against children are male. Females may account for 0.4% to 4% of convicted sexual offenders, and one study estimates a 10 to 1 ratio of male-to-female child molesters. [16] The true number of female child molesters may be underrepresented by available estimates, for reasons including a "societal tendency to dismiss the negative impact of sexual relationships between young boys and adult women, as well as women's greater access to very young children who cannot report their abuse", among other explanations. [16]
The term pedophile is commonly used by the public to describe all child sexual abuse offenders. [7] [11] This usage is considered problematic by researchers, because many child molesters do not have a strong sexual interest in prepubescent children, and are consequently not pedophiles. [10] [11] [13] [68] There are motives for child sexual abuse that are unrelated to pedophilia, [77] such as stress, marital problems, the unavailability of an adult partner, [99] general anti-social tendencies, high sex drive, or alcohol use. [100] As child sexual abuse is not automatically an indicator that its perpetrator is a pedophile, offenders can be separated into two types: pedophilic and non-pedophilic [101] (or preferential and situational [8] ). Estimates for the rate of pedophilia in detected child molesters generally range between 25% and 50%. [102] A 2006 study found that 35% of its sample of child molesters were pedophilic. [103] Pedophilia appears to be less common in incest offenders, [104] especially fathers and step-fathers. [105] According to a U.S. study on 2429 adult male sex offenders who were categorized as "pedophiles", only 7% identified themselves as exclusive; indicating that many or most child sexual abusers may fall into the non-exclusive category. [9]
Some pedophiles do not molest children. [5] [6] [12] [13] Little is known about this population because most studies of pedophilia use criminal or clinical samples, which may not be representative of pedophiles in general. [106] Researcher Michael Seto suggests that pedophiles who commit child sexual abuse do so because of other anti-social traits in addition to their sexual attraction. He states that pedophiles who are "reflective, sensitive to the feelings of others, averse to risk, abstain from alcohol or drug use, and endorse attitudes and beliefs supportive of norms and the laws" may be unlikely to abuse children. [13] A 2015 study found that pedophiles who molested children were neurologically distinct from non-offending pedophiles. The pedophilic molesters had neurological deficits suggestive of disruptions in inhibitory regions of the brain, while non-offending pedophiles had no such deficits. [107]
According to Abel, Mittleman, and Becker [108] (1985) and Ward et al. (1995), there are generally large distinctions between the characteristics of pedophilic and non-pedophilic molesters. They state that non-pedophilic offenders tend to offend at times of stress; have a later onset of offending; and have fewer, often familial, victims, while pedophilic offenders often start offending at an early age; often have a larger number of victims who are frequently extrafamilial; are more inwardly driven to offend; and have values or beliefs that strongly support an offense lifestyle. One study found that pedophilic molesters had a median of 1.3 victims for those with girl victims and 4.4 for those with boy victims. [102] Child molesters, pedophilic or not, employ a variety of methods to gain sexual access to children. Some groom their victims into compliance with attention and gifts, while others use threats, alcohol or drugs, or physical force. [109]

History
Pedophilia is believed to have occurred in humans throughout history, [110] but was not formally named, defined or studied until the late 19th century. The term paedophilia erotica was coined in an 1896 article by the Viennese psychiatrist Richard von Krafft-Ebing but does not enter the author's Psychopathia Sexualis [111] until the 10th German edition. [112] A number of authors anticipated Krafft-Ebing's diagnostic gesture. [112] In Psychopathia Sexualis , the term appears in a section titled "Violation of Individuals Under the Age of Fourteen", which focuses on the forensic psychiatry aspect of child sexual offenders in general. Krafft-Ebing describes several typologies of offender, dividing them into psychopathological and non-psychopathological origins, and hypothesizes several apparent causal factors that may lead to the sexual abuse of children. [111]
Krafft-Ebing mentioned paedophilia erotica in a typology of "psycho-sexual perversion". He wrote that he had only encountered it four times in his career and gave brief descriptions of each case, listing three common traits:
He mentions several cases of pedophilia among adult women (provided by another physician), and also considered the abuse of boys by homosexual men to be extremely rare. [111] Further clarifying this point, he indicated that cases of adult men who have some medical or neurological disorder and abuse a male child are not true pedophilia and that, in his observation, victims of such men tended to be older and pubescent. He also lists pseudopaedophilia as a related condition wherein "individuals who have lost libido for the adult through masturbation and subsequently turn to children for the gratification of their sexual appetite" and claimed this is much more common. [111]
Austrian neurologist Sigmund Freud briefly wrote about the topic in his 1905 book Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality in a section titled The Sexually immature and Animals as Sexual objects. He wrote that exclusive pedophilia was rare and only occasionally were prepubescent children exclusive objects. He wrote that they usually were the subject of desire when a weak person "makes use of such substitutes" or when an uncontrollable instinct which will not allow delay seeks immediate gratification and cannot find a more appropriate object. [114]
In 1908, Swiss neuroanatomist and psychiatrist Auguste Forel wrote of the phenomenon, proposing that it be referred to it as "Pederosis", the "Sexual Appetite for Children". Similar to Krafft-Ebing's work, Forel made the distinction between incidental sexual abuse by persons with dementia and other organic brain conditions, and the truly preferential and sometimes exclusive sexual desire for children. However, he disagreed with Krafft-Ebing in that he felt the condition of the latter was largely ingrained and unchangeable. [115]
The term pedophilia became the generally accepted term for the condition and saw widespread adoption in the early 20th century, appearing in many popular medical dictionaries such as the 5th Edition of Stedman's in 1918. In 1952, it was included in the first edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders . [116] This edition and the subsequent DSM-II listed the disorder as one subtype of the classification "Sexual Deviation", but no diagnostic criteria were provided. The DSM-III, published in 1980, contained a full description of the disorder and provided a set of guidelines for diagnosis. [117] The revision in 1987, the DSM-III-R, kept the description largely the same, but updated and expanded the diagnostic criteria. [118]

Law and forensic psychology

Definitions
Pedophilia is not a legal term, [9] and having a sexual attraction to children is not illegal. [6] In law enforcement circles, the term pedophile is sometimes used informally to refer to any person who commits one or more sexually-based crimes that relate to legally underage victims. These crimes may include child sexual abuse , statutory rape , offenses involving child pornography , child grooming , stalking , and indecent exposure . One unit of the United Kingdom's Child Abuse Investigation Command is known as the " Paedophile Unit " and specializes in online investigations and enforcement work. [119] Some forensic science texts, such as Holmes (2008), use the term to refer to offenders who target child victims, even when such children are not the primary sexual interest of the offender. [120] FBI agent Kenneth Lanning, however, makes a point of distinguishing between pedophiles and child molesters. [121]

Civil and legal commitment
In the United States, following Kansas v. Hendricks , sex offenders who have certain mental disorders, including pedophilia, can be subject to indefinite civil commitment under various state laws [19] (generically called SVP laws [122] ) and the federal Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006. [123] Similar legislation exists in Canada. [19]
In Kansas v. Hendricks , the US Supreme Court upheld as constitutional a Kansas law, the Sexually Violent Predator Act , under which Hendricks, a pedophile, was found to have a "mental abnormality" defined as a "congenital or acquired condition affecting the emotional or volitional capacity which predisposes the person to commit sexually violent offenses to the degree that such person is a menace to the health and safety of others", which allowed the State to confine Hendricks indefinitely irrespective of whether the State provided any treatment to him. [124] [125] [126] In United States v. Comstock , this type of indefinite confinement was upheld for someone previously convicted on child pornography charges; this time a federal law was involved—the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act. [123] [127] The Walsh Act does not require a conviction on a sex offense charge, but only that the person be a federal prisoner , and one who "has engaged or attempted to engage in sexually violent conduct or child molestation and who is sexually dangerous to others", and who "would have serious difficulty in refraining from sexually violent conduct or child molestation if released". [128]
In the US, offenders with pedophilia are more likely to be recommended for civil commitment than non-pedophilic offenders. About half of committed offenders have a diagnosis of pedophilia. [19] Psychiatrist Michael First writes that, since not all people with a paraphilia have difficulty controlling their behavior, the evaluating clinician must present additional evidence of volitional impairment instead of recommending commitment based on pedophilia alone. [129]

Society and culture

General
Pedophilia is one of the most stigmatized mental disorders. [35] One study reported high levels of anger, fear and social rejection towards pedophiles who have not committed a crime. [130] The authors suggested such attitudes could negatively impact child sexual abuse prevention by reducing pedophiles' mental stability and discouraging them from seeking help. [35] According to sociologists Melanie-Angela Neuilly and Kristen Zgoba, social concern over pedophilia intensified greatly in the 1990s, coinciding with several sensational sex crimes (but a general decline in child sexual abuse rates). They found that the word pedophile appeared only rarely in The New York Times and Le Monde before 1996, with zero mentions in 1991. [131]
Social attitudes towards child sexual abuse are extremely negative, with some surveys ranking it as morally worse than murder. [132] Early research showed that there was a great deal of misunderstanding and unrealistic perceptions in the general public about child sexual abuse and pedophiles. However, a 2004 study concluded that the public was well-informed on some aspects of these subjects. [133]

Misuse of medical terminology
The words pedophile and pedophilia are commonly used informally to describe an adult's sexual interest in pubescent or post-pubescent teenagers. The terms hebephilia or ephebophilia may be more accurate in these cases. [9] [24] [134] This was especially seen in the case of Mark Foley during the congressional page incident . Most of the media labeled Foley a pedophile, which led David Tuller of Slate magazine to state that Foley was not a pedophile but rather an ephebophile. [135]
Another common usage of pedophilia is to refer to the act of sexual abuse itself, [5] rather than the medical meaning, which is a preference for prepubescents on the part of the older individual ( see above for an explanation of the distinction). [7] [8] There are also situations where the terms are misused to refer to relationships where the younger person is an adult of legal age, but is either considered too young in comparison to their older partner, or the older partner occupies a position of authority over them. [136] Researchers state that the above uses of the term pedophilia are imprecise or suggest that they are best avoided. [7] [24] The Mayo Clinic states that pedophilia "is not a criminal or legal term". [9]

Pedophile advocacy groups
From the late 1950s to early 1990s, several pedophile membership organizations advocated age of consent reform to lower or abolish age of consent laws, [137] [138] [139] as well as for the acceptance of pedophilia as a sexual orientation rather than a psychological disorder , [140] and for the legalization of child pornography. [139] The efforts of pedophile advocacy groups did not gain any public support [137] [139] [141] [142] [143] and today those few groups that have not dissolved have only minimal membership and have ceased their activities other than through a few websites. [139] [143] [144] [145] In contrast to these organizations, members of the support group Virtuous Pedophiles believe that child sexual abuse is wrong and seek to raise awareness that some pedophiles do not offend; [146] [147] this is generally not considered pedophile advocacy, as the Virtuous Pedophiles organization does not approve of the legalization of child pornography and does not support age of consent reform . [148]

Anti-pedophile activism
Anti-pedophile activism encompasses opposition against pedophiles, against pedophile advocacy groups, and against other phenomena that are seen as related to pedophilia, such as child pornography and child sexual abuse. [149] Much of the direct action classified as anti-pedophile involves demonstrations against sex offenders, against pedophiles advocating for the legalization of sexual activity between adults and children, and against Internet users who solicit sex from minors. [150] [151] [152] [153]
High-profile media attention to pedophilia has led to incidents of moral panic , particularly following reports of pedophilia associated with Satanic ritual abuse and day care sex abuse . [154] Instances of vigilantism have also been reported in response to public attention on convicted or suspected child sex offenders. In 2000, following a media campaign of "naming and shaming" suspected pedophiles in the UK, hundreds of residents took to the streets in protest against suspected pedophiles, eventually escalating to violent conduct requiring police intervention. [150]

Privacy
Privacy is the ability of an individual or group to seclude themselves, or information about themselves, and thereby express themselves selectively. The boundaries and content of what is considered private differ among cultures and individuals, but share common themes. When something is private to a person , it usually means that something is inherently special or sensitive to them. The domain of privacy partially overlaps security (confidentiality), which can include the concepts of appropriate use, as well as protection of information. Privacy may also take the form of bodily integrity .
The right not to be subjected to unsanctioned invasion of privacy by the government , corporations or individuals is part of many countries' privacy laws , and in some cases, constitutions . Almost all countries have laws which in some way limit privacy. An example of this would be law concerning taxation , which normally require the sharing of information about personal income or earnings . In some countries individual privacy may conflict with freedom of speech laws and some laws may require public disclosure of information which would be considered private in other countries and cultures.
Privacy may be voluntarily sacrificed , normally in exchange for perceived benefits and very often with specific dangers and losses, although this is a very strategic view of human relationships. Research shows that people are more willing to voluntarily sacrifice privacy if the data gatherer is seen to be transparent as to what information is gathered and how it is used. [1] In the business world, a person may volunteer personal details (often for advertising purposes) in order to gamble on winning a prize. A person may also disclose personal information as part of being an executive for a publicly traded company in the USA pursuant to federal securities law. [2] Personal information which is voluntarily shared but subsequently stolen or misused can lead to identity theft .
The concept of universal individual privacy is a modern construct primarily associated with Western culture , British and North American in particular, and remained virtually unknown in some cultures until recent times. According to some researchers, this concept sets Anglo-American culture apart even from Western European cultures such as French or Italian. [3] Most cultures, however, recognize the ability of individuals to withhold certain parts of their personal information from wider society—closing the door to one's home, for example.
The distinction or overlap between secrecy and privacy is ontologically subtle, which is why the word "privacy" is an example of an untranslatable lexeme , [4] and many languages do not have a specific word for "privacy". Such languages either use a complex description to translate the term (such as Russian combining the meaning of уединение —solitude, секретность —secrecy, and частная жизнь —private life) or borrow from English "privacy" (as Indonesian Privasi or Italian la privacy ). [4] The distinction hinges on the discreteness of interests of parties (persons or groups), which can have emic variation depending on cultural mores of individualism , collectivism , and the negotiation between individual and group rights . The difference is sometimes expressed humorously as "when I withhold information, it is privacy; when you withhold information, it is secrecy."
On December 15, 1890, Samuel Warren and Louis Brandeis published the article of the law called "The right to privacy", [5] considered one of the most influential papers in the history of American law.

Concepts
A broad multicultural literary tradition going to the beginnings of recorded history discusses the concept of privacy. [6] One way of categorizing all concepts of privacy is by considering all discussions as one of these concepts: [6]

Right to be let alone
In 1890 the United States jurists Samuel D. Warren and Louis Brandeis wrote The Right to Privacy , an article in which they argued for the "right to be let alone", using that phrase as a definition of privacy. [7] There is extensive commentary over the meaning of being "let alone", and among other ways, it has been interpreted to mean the right of a person to choose seclusion from the attention of others if they wish to do so, and the right to be immune from scrutiny or being observed in private settings, such as one’s own home. [7] Although this early vague legal concept did not describe privacy in a way that made it easy to design broad legal protections of privacy, it strengthened the notion of privacy rights for individuals and began a legacy of discussion on those rights. [7]

Limited access
Limited access refers to a person’s ability to participate in society without having other individuals and organizations collect information about them. [8]
Various theorists have imagined privacy as a system for limiting access to one’s personal information. [8] Edwin Lawrence Godkin wrote in the late 19th century that "nothing is better worthy of legal protection than private life, or, in other words, the right of every man to keep his affairs to himself, and to decide for himself to what extent they shall be the subject of public observation and discussion." [8] [9] Adopting an approach similar to the one presented by Ruth Gavison [1] 9 years earlier, [10] Sissela Bok said that privacy is "the condition of being protected from unwanted access by others—either physical access, personal information, or attention." [8] [11]

Control over information
Control over one's personal information is the concept that "privacy is the claim of individuals, groups, or institutions to determine for themselves when, how, and to what extent information about them is communicated to others." [12] [13] Charles Fried said that "Privacy is not simply an absence of information about us in the minds of others; rather it is the control we have over information about ourselves." [12] [14] Control over personal information is one of the more popular theories of the meaning of privacy. [12]

States of privacy
Alan Westin defined four states—or experiences—of privacy: solitude, intimacy, anonymity, and reserve. Solitude is a physical separation from others. [15] Intimacy is a "close, relaxed, and frank relationship between two or more individuals" that results from the seclusion of a pair or small group of individuals. [15] Anonymity is the "desire of individuals for times of 'public privacy.'" [15] Lastly, reserve is the "creation of a psychological barrier against unwanted intrusion"; this creation of a psychological barrier requires others to respect an individual's need or desire to restrict communication of information concerning himself or herself. [15]
In addition to the psychological barrier of reserve, Kirsty Hughes identified three more kinds of privacy barriers: physical, behavioral, and normative. Physical barriers, such as walls and doors, prevent others from accessing and experiencing the individual. [16] (In this sense, "accessing" an individual includes accessing personal information about him or her.) [16] Behavioral barriers communicate to others—verbally, through language, or non-verbally, through personal space, body language, or clothing—that an individual does not want them to access or experience him or her. [16] Lastly, normative barriers, such as laws and social norms, restrain others from attempting to access or experience an individual. [16]

Secrecy
Privacy is sometimes defined as an option to have secrecy. Richard Posner said that privacy is the right of people to "conceal information about themselves that others might use to their disadvantage". [17] [18]
In various legal contexts, when privacy is described as secrecy, a conclusion if privacy is secrecy then rights to privacy do not apply for any information which is already publicly disclosed. [19] When privacy-as-secrecy is discussed, it is usually imagined to be a selective kind of secrecy in which individuals keep some information secret and private while they choose to make other information public and not private. [19]

Personhood and autonomy
Privacy may be understood as a necessary precondition for the development and preservation of personhood. Jeffrey Reiman defined privacy in terms of a recognition of one's ownership of his or her physical and mental reality and a moral right to his or her self-determination. [20] Through the "social ritual" of privacy, or the social practice of respecting an individual's privacy barriers, the social group communicates to the developing child that he or she has exclusive moral rights to his or her body—in other words, he or she has moral ownership of his or her body. [20] This entails control over both active (physical) and cognitive appropriation, the former being control over one's movements and actions and the latter being control over who can experience one's physical existence and when. [20]
Alternatively, Stanley Benn defined privacy in terms of a recognition of oneself as a subject with agency—as an individual with the capacity to choose. [21] Privacy is required to exercise choice. [21] Overt observation makes the individual aware of himself or herself as an object with a "determinate character" and "limited probabilities." [21] Covert observation, on the other hand, changes the conditions in which the individual is exercising choice without his or her knowledge and consent. [21]
In addition, privacy may be viewed as a state that enables autonomy, a concept closely connected to that of personhood. According to Joseph Kufer, an autonomous self-concept entails a conception of oneself as a "purposeful, self-determining, responsible agent" and an awareness of one's capacity to control the boundary between self and other—that is, to control who can access and experience him or her and to what extent. [22] Furthermore, others must acknowledge and respect the self's boundaries—in other words, they must respect the individual's privacy. [22]
The studies of psychologists such as Jean Piaget and Victor Tausk show that, as children learn that they can control who can access and experience them and to what extent, they develop an autonomous self-concept. [22] In addition, studies of adults in particular institutions, such as Erving Goffman's study of "total institutions" such as prisons and mental institutions, [23] suggest that systemic and routinized deprivations or violations of privacy deteriorate one's sense of autonomy over time. [22]

Self-identity and personal growth
Privacy may be understood as a prerequisite for the development of a sense of self-identity. Privacy barriers, in particular, are instrumental in this process. According to Irwin Altman, such barriers "define and limit the boundaries of the self" and thus "serve to help define [the self]." [24] This control primarily entails the ability to regulate contact with others. [24] Control over the "permeability" of the self's boundaries enables one to control what constitutes the self and thus to define what is the self. [24]
In addition, privacy may be seen as a state that fosters personal growth, a process integral to the development of self-identity. Hyman Gross suggested that, without privacy—solitude, anonymity, and temporary releases from social roles—individuals would be unable to freely express themselves and to engage in self-discovery and self-criticism. [22] Such self-discovery and self-criticism contributes to one's understanding of oneself and shapes one's sense of identity. [22]

Intimacy
In a way analogous to how the personhood theory imagines privacy as some essential part of being an individual, the intimacy theory imagines privacy to be an essential part of the way that humans have strengthened or intimate relationships with other humans. [25] Because part of human relationships includes individuals volunteering to self-disclose some information, but withholding other information, there is a concept of privacy as a part of the process by means of which humans establish relationships with each other. [25]
James Rachels advanced this notion by writing that privacy matters because "there is a close connection between our ability to control who has access to us and to information about us, and our ability to create and maintain different sorts of social relationships with different people." [25] [26]

Concepts in popular media
Privacy can mean different things in different contexts; different people, cultures, and nations have different expectations about how much privacy a person is entitled to or what constitutes an invasion of privacy .

Personal privacy
Most people have a strong sense of privacy in relation to the exposure of their body to others. This is an aspect of personal modesty . A person will go to extreme lengths to protect this personal modesty, the main way being the wearing of clothes . Other ways include erection of walls , fences , screens, use of cathedral glass , partitions, by maintaining a distance, beside other ways. People who go to those lengths expect that their privacy will be respected by others. At the same time, people are prepared to expose themselves in acts of physical intimacy , but these are confined to exposure in circumstances and of persons of their choosing. Even a discussion of those circumstances is regarded as intrusive and typically unwelcome.
Physical privacy could be defined as preventing "intrusions into one's physical space or solitude." [27] This would include concerns such as:
An example of the legal basis for the right to physical privacy is the U.S. Fourth Amendment , which guarantees "the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures". [28] Most countries have laws regarding trespassing and property rights also determine the right of physical privacy.
Physical privacy may be a matter of cultural sensitivity, personal dignity, and/or shyness. There may also be concerns about safety, if for example one is wary of becoming the victim of crime or stalking . [29] Civil inattention is a process whereby individuals are able to maintain their privacy within a crowd.

Informational
Information or data privacy refers to the evolving relationship between technology and the legal right to, or public expectation of, privacy in the collection and sharing of data about one's self. Privacy concerns exist wherever uniquely identifiable data relating to a person or persons are collected and stored, in digital form or otherwise. In some cases these concerns refer to how data are collected, stored, and associated. In other cases the issue is who is given access to information. Other issues include whether an individual has any ownership rights to data about them, and/or the right to view, verify, and challenge that information.
Various types of personal information are often associated with privacy concerns. Information plays an important role in the decision-action process, which can lead to problems in terms of privacy and availability. First, it allows people to see all the options and alternatives available. Secondly, it allows people to choose which of the options would be best for a certain situation. An information landscape consists of the information, its location in the so-called network, as well as its availability, awareness, and usability. Yet the set-up of the information landscape means that information that is available in one place may not be available somewhere else. This can lead to a privacy situation that leads to questions regarding which people have the power to access and use certain information, who should have that power, and what provisions govern it. For various reasons, individuals may object to personal information such as their religion, sexual orientation, political affiliations, or personal activities being revealed, perhaps to avoid discrimination , personal embarrassment, or damage to their professional reputations.
Financial privacy , in which information about a person's financial transactions is guarded, is important for the avoidance of fraud including identity theft . Information about a person's purchases, for instance, can reveal a great deal about their preferences, places they have visited, their contacts, products (such as medications) they use, their activities and habits, etc. In addition to this, financial privacy also includes privacy over the bank accounts opened by individuals. Information about the bank where the individual has an account with, and whether or not this is in a country that does not share this information with other countries can help countries in fighting tax avoidance .
Internet privacy is the ability to determine what information one reveals or withholds about oneself over the Internet, who has access to such information, and for what purposes one's information may or may not be used. For example, web users may be concerned to discover that many of the web sites which they visit collect, store, and possibly share personally identifiable information about them. Similarly, Internet email users generally consider their emails to be private and hence would be concerned if their email was being accessed, read, stored or forwarded by third parties without their consent. Tools used to protect privacy on the Internet include encryption tools and anonymizing services like I2P and Tor .
Medical privacy Protected Health Information OCR/HIPAA allows a person to withhold their medical records and other information from others, perhaps because of fears that it might affect their insurance coverage or employment, or to avoid the embarrassment caused by revealing medical conditions or treatments. Medical information could also reveal other aspects of one's personal life, such as sexual preferences or proclivity. A right to sexual privacy enables individuals to acquire and use contraceptives without family, community or legal sanctions.
Political privacy has been a concern since voting systems emerged in ancient times. The secret ballot helps to ensure that voters cannot be coerced into voting in certain ways, since they can allocate their vote as they wish in the privacy and security of the voting booth while maintaining the anonymity of the vote. Secret ballots are nearly universal in modern democracy , and considered a basic right of citizenship , despite the difficulties that they cause (for example the inability to trace votes back to the corresponding voters increases the risk of someone stuffing additional fraudulent votes into the system: additional security controls are needed to minimize such risks).
Corporate privacy refers to the privacy rights of corporate actors like senior executives of large, publicly traded corporations. Desires for corporate privacy can frequently raise issues with obligations for public disclosures under securities and corporate law.

Organizational
Government agencies, corporations, groups/societies and other organizations may desire to keep their activities or secrets from being revealed to other organizations or individuals, adopting various security practices and controls in order to keep private information confidential. Organizations may seek legal protection for their secrets. For example, a government administration may be able to invoke executive privilege [30] or declare certain information to be classified , or a corporation might attempt to protect valuable proprietary information as trade secrets . [28]

Spiritual and intellectual
The earliest legislative development of privacy rights began under British common law , which protected "only the physical interference of life and property." Its development from then on became "one of the most significant chapters in the history of privacy law." [31] Privacy rights gradually expanded to include a "recognition of man's spiritual nature, of his feelings and his intellect." [31] Eventually, the scope of those rights broadened even further to include a basic "right to be let alone", and the former definition of "property" would then comprise "every form of possession—intangible, as well as tangible." By the late 19th century, interest in a "right to privacy" grew as a response to the growth of print media, especially newspapers. [31]

History
Privacy has historical roots in philosophical discussions, the most well-known being Aristotle's distinction between two spheres of life: the public sphere of the polis , associated with political life, and the private sphere of the oikos , associated with domestic life. [32] More systematic treatises of privacy in the United States did not appear until the 1890s, with the development of privacy law in America. [32]

Technology
As technology has advanced, the way in which privacy is protected and violated has changed with it. In the case of some technologies, such as the printing press or the Internet , the increased ability to share information can lead to new ways in which privacy can be breached. It is generally agreed that the first publication advocating privacy in the United States was the article by Samuel Warren and Louis Brandeis , " The Right to Privacy ", 4 Harvard Law Review 193 (1890) , that was written largely in response to the increase in newspapers and photographs made possible by printing technologies. [33] [34]
New technologies can also create new ways to gather private information. For example, in the United States it was thought that heat sensors intended to be used to find marijuana-growing operations would be acceptable. However, in 2001 in Kyllo v. United States (533 U.S. 27) it was decided that the use of thermal imaging devices that can reveal previously unknown information without a warrant does indeed constitute a violation of privacy. [35]
Generally the increased ability to gather and send information has had negative implications for retaining privacy. As large-scale information systems become more common, there is so much information stored in many databases worldwide that an individual has no practical means of knowing of or controlling all of the information about themselves that others may have hold or access. Such information could potentially be sold to others for profit and/or be used for purposes not known to or sanctioned by the individual concerned. The concept of information privacy has become more significant as more systems controlling more information appear. Also the consequences of privacy violations can be more severe. Privacy law in many countries has had to adapt to changes in technology in order to address these issues and, to some extent, maintain privacy rights. But the existing global privacy rights framework has also been criticized as incoherent and inefficient. Proposals such as the APEC Privacy Framework have emerged which set out to provide the first comprehensive legal framework on the issue of global data privacy.
There are various theories about privacy and privacy control. The Invasion Paradigm defines privacy violation as the hostile actions of a wrongdoer who causes direct harm to an individual. This is a reactive view of privacy protection as it waits until there is a violation before acting to protect the violated individual, sometimes through criminal punishments for those who invaded the privacy of others. In the Invasion Paradigm this threat of criminal punishment that is supposed to work as deterrent. The Secrecy paradigm defines a privacy invasion as someone’s concealed information or hidden world being revealed through surveillance. The Negative Freedom Paradigm views privacy as freedom from invasion rather than a right, going against the more popular view of a "right to privacy." Finally, the Inaccessibility Paradigm states that privacy is the state where something is completely inaccessible to others. Daniel Solove, a law professor at George Washington University also has a theory of privacy. He believes that a conceptualized view of privacy will not work because there is no one core element. There are many different, interconnected elements involved in privacy and privacy protection. Therefore, Solove proposes looking at these issues from the bottom up, focusing on privacy problems. People may often overlook the fact that certain elements of privacy problems are due to the structure of privacy itself. Therefore, the architecture must change wherein people must learn to view privacy as a social and legal structure. He also states that people have to redefine the relationship between privacy and businesses and the government. Participation in certain privacy elements of the government and businesses should allow people to choose whether they want to be a part of certain aspects of their work that could be considered privacy invasion.

Internet
The Internet has brought new concerns about privacy in an age where computers can permanently store records of everything: "where every online photo, status update, Twitter post and blog entry by and about us can be stored forever", writes law professor and author Jeffrey Rosen . [36]
This currently has an effect on employment. Microsoft reports that 75 percent of U.S. recruiters and human-resource professionals now do online research about candidates, often using information provided by search engines, social-networking sites, photo/video-sharing sites, personal web sites and blogs, and Twitter . They also report that 70 percent of U.S. recruiters have rejected candidates based on internet information. This has created a need by many to control various online privacy settings in addition to controlling their online reputations, both of which have led to legal suits against various sites and employers. [36]
The ability to do online inquiries about individuals has expanded dramatically over the last decade. Facebook for example, as of August 2015, was the largest social-networking site, with nearly 1,490 million members, who upload over 4.75 billion pieces of content daily. Over 83.09 million accounts were fake. Twitter has more than 316 million registered users and over 20 million are fake users. The Library of Congress recently announced that it will be acquiring—and permanently storing—the entire archive of public Twitter posts since 2006, reports Rosen. [36]
Importantly, directly observed behaviour, such as browsing logs, search queries, or contents of the Facebook profile can be automatically processed to infer secondary information about an individual, such as sexual orientation, political and religious views, race, substance use, intelligence, and personality. [37] [38] Effectively, individual views and preferences can be revealed even if they were not directly expressed or indicated (e.g. by stating their political views on their Facebook profile, or visiting a gay community website).
According to some experts, many commonly used communication devices may be mapping every move of their users. Senator Al Franken has noted the seriousness of iPhones and iPads having the ability to record and store users' locations in unencrypted files, [39] although Apple denied doing so. [40]
Andrew Grove , co-founder and former CEO of Intel Corporation , offered his thoughts on internet privacy in an interview published in May 2000: [41]

Actions which take away privacy
As with other concepts about privacy, there are various ways to discuss what kinds of processes or actions remove, challenge, lessen, or attack privacy. In 1960 legal scholar William Prosser created the following list of activities which can be remedied with privacy protection: [42] [43]
Building from this and other historical precedents, Daniel J. Solove presented another classification of actions which are harmful to privacy, including collection of information which is already somewhat public, processing of information, sharing information, and invading personal space to get private information. [44]

Collecting information
In the context of harming privacy, information collection means gathering whatever information can be obtained by doing something to obtain it. [44] Surveillance is an example of this, when someone decides to begin watching and recording someone or something, and interrogation is another example of this, when someone uses another person as a source of information. [44]

Aggregating information
It can happen that privacy is not harmed when information is available, but that the harm can come when that information is collected as a set then processed in a way that the collective reporting of pieces of information encroaches on privacy. [45] Actions in this category which can lessen privacy include the following: [45]

Information dissemination
Information dissemination is an attack on privacy when information which was shared in confidence is shared or threatened to be shared in a way that harms the subject of the information. [45]
There are various examples of this. [45] Breach of confidentiality is when one entity promises to keep a person’s information private, then breaks that promise. [45] Disclosure is making information about a person more accessible in a way that harms the subject of the information, regardless of how the information was collected or the intent of making it available. [45] Exposure is a special type of disclosure in which the information disclosed is emotional to the subject or taboo to share, such as revealing their private life experiences, their nudity, or perhaps private body functions. [45] Increased accessibility means advertising the availability of information without actually distributing it, as in the case of doxxing. [45] Blackmail is making a threat to share information, perhaps as part of an effort to coerce someone. [45] Appropriation is an attack on the personhood of someone, and can include using the value of someone's reputation or likeness to advance interests which are not those of the person being appropriated. [45] Distortion is the creation of misleading information or lies about a person. [45]

Invasions
Invasion of privacy is a different concept from the collecting, aggregating, and disseminating information because those three are a misuse of available data, whereas invasion is an attack on the right of individuals to keep personal secrets. [45] An invasion is an attack in which information, whether intended to be public or not, is captured in a way that insults the personal dignity and right to private space of the person whose data is taken. [45]
An intrusion is any unwanted entry into a person's private personal space and solitude for any reason, regardless of whether data is taken during that breach of space. [45] "Decisional interference" is when an entity somehow injects itself into the personal decision making process of another person, perhaps to influence that person's private decisions but in any case doing so in a way that disrupts the private personal thoughts that a person has. [45]

Right to privacy
Privacy uses the theory of natural rights, and generally responds to new information and communication technologies. In North America, Samuel D. Warren and Louis D. Brandeis wrote that privacy is the "right to be let alone" (Warren & Brandeis, 1890) focuses on protecting individuals. This citation was a response to recent technological developments, such as photography, and sensationalist journalism, also known as yellow journalism . [46]
Privacy rights are inherently intertwined with information technology. In his widely cited dissenting opinion in Olmstead v. United States (1928), Brandeis relied on thoughts he developed in his Harvard Law Review article in 1890. But in his dissent, he now changed the focus whereby he urged making personal privacy matters more relevant to constitutional law , going so far as saying "the government [was] identified .... as a potential privacy invader." He writes, "Discovery and invention have made it possible for the Government, by means far more effective than stretching upon the rack, to obtain disclosure in court of what is whispered in the closet." At that time, telephones were often community assets, with shared party lines and the potentially nosey human operators. By the time of Katz, in 1967, telephones had become personal devices with lines not shared across homes and switching was electro-mechanical. In the 1970s, new computing and recording technologies began to raise concerns about privacy, resulting in the Fair Information Practice Principles .

Definitions
In recent years there have been only few attempts to clearly and precisely define a "right to privacy." Some experts assert that in fact the right to privacy "should not be defined as a separate legal right" at all. By their reasoning, existing laws relating to privacy in general should be sufficient. [47] Other experts, such as Dean Prosser , have attempted, but failed, to find a "common ground" between the leading kinds of privacy cases in the court system, at least to formulate a definition. [47] One law school treatise from Israel, however, on the subject of "privacy in the digital environment", suggests that the "right to privacy should be seen as an independent right that deserves legal protection in itself." It has therefore proposed a working definition for a "right to privacy":

An individual right
Alan Westin believes that new technologies alter the balance between privacy and disclosure, and that privacy rights may limit government surveillance to protect democratic processes. Westin defines privacy as "the claim of individuals, groups, or institutions to determine for themselves when, how, and to what extent information about them is communicated to others". Westin describes four states of privacy: solitude, intimacy, anonymity, and reserve. These states must balance participation against norms:
Under liberal democratic systems, privacy creates a space separate from political life, and allows personal autonomy, while ensuring democratic freedoms of association and expression .
David Flaherty believes networked computer databases pose threats to privacy. He develops 'data protection' as an aspect of privacy, which involves "the collection, use, and dissemination of personal information". This concept forms the foundation for fair information practices used by governments globally. Flaherty forwards an idea of privacy as information control, "[i]ndividuals want to be left alone and to exercise some control over how information about them is used". [49]
Richard Posner and Lawrence Lessig focus on the economic aspects of personal information control. Posner criticizes privacy for concealing information, which reduces market efficiency. For Posner, employment is selling oneself in the labour market, which he believes is like selling a product. Any 'defect' in the 'product' that is not reported is fraud. [50] For Lessig, privacy breaches online can be regulated through code and law. Lessig claims "the protection of privacy would be stronger if people conceived of the right as a property right", and that "individuals should be able to control information about themselves". [51] Economic approaches to privacy make communal conceptions of privacy difficult to maintain.

A collective "value" and a "human right"
There have been attempts to reframe privacy as a fundamental human right , whose social value is an essential component in the functioning of democratic societies. [52] Amitai Etzioni suggests a communitarian approach to privacy. This requires a shared moral culture for establishing social order. [53] Etzioni believes that "[p]rivacy is merely one good among many others", [54] and that technological effects depend on community accountability and oversight (ibid). He claims that privacy laws only increase government surveillance by weakening informal social controls. [55] Furthermore, the government is no longer the only or even principle threat to people's privacy. Etzioni notes that corporate data miners, or " Privacy Merchants ," stand to profit by selling massive dossiers personal information, including purchasing decisions and Internet traffic, to the highest bidder. And while some might not find collection of private information objectionable when it is only used commercially by the private sector, the information these corporations amass and process is also available to the government, so that it is no longer possible to protect privacy by only curbing the State. [56]
Priscilla Regan believes that individual concepts of privacy have failed philosophically and in policy. She supports a social value of privacy with three dimensions: shared perceptions, public values, and collective components. Shared ideas about privacy allows freedom of conscience and diversity in thought. Public values guarantee democratic participation, including freedoms of speech and association, and limits government power. Collective elements describe privacy as collective good that cannot be divided. Regan's goal is to strengthen privacy claims in policy making: "if we did recognize the collective or public-good value of privacy, as well as the common and public value of privacy, those advocating privacy protections would have a stronger basis upon which to argue for its protection". [57]
Leslie Regan Shade argues that the human right to privacy is necessary for meaningful democratic participation, and ensures human dignity and autonomy. Privacy depends on norms for how information is distributed, and if this is appropriate. Violations of privacy depend on context. The human right to privacy has precedent in the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights : "Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers." [58] Shade believes that privacy must be approached from a people-centered perspective, and not through the marketplace. [59]

Protection
Most countries give citizen rights to privacy in their constitutions. [60] Representative examples of this include the Constitution of Brazil , which says "the privacy, private life, honor and image of people are inviolable"; the Constitution of South Africa says that "everyone has a right to privacy"; and the Constitution of the Republic of Korea says "the privacy of no citizen shall be infringed." [60] Among most countries whose constitutions do not explicitly describe privacy rights, court decisions have interpreted their constitutions to intend to give privacy rights. [60]
Many countries have broad privacy laws outside their constitutions, including Australia’s Privacy Act 1988 , Argentina’s Law for the Protection of Personal Data of 2000, Canada’s 2000 Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act , and Japan’s 2003 Personal Information Protection Law. [60]
Beyond national privacy laws, there are international privacy agreements. [61] The United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights says "No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honor and reputation." [60] The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development published its Privacy Guidelines in 1980. The European Union 's 1995 Data Protection Directive guides privacy protection in Europe. [60] The 2004 Privacy Framework by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation is a privacy protection agreement for the members of that organization. [60]
In the 1960s people began to consider how changes in technology were bringing changes in the concept of privacy. [60] Vance Packard ’s The Naked Society was a popular book on privacy from that era and led discourse on privacy at that time. [60]

Free market versus consumer protection approaches
Approaches to privacy can, broadly, be divided into two categories: free market, and consumer protection. [62] In a free market approach, commercial entities are largely allowed to do what they wish, with the expectation that consumers will choose to do business with corporations that respect their privacy to a desired degree. If some companies are not sufficiently respectful of privacy, they will lose market share. Such an approach may be limited by lack of competition in a market, by enterprises not offering privacy options favorable to the user, or by lack of information about actual privacy practices. Claims of privacy protection made by companies may be difficult for consumers to verify, except when they have already been violated.
In a consumer protection approach, in contrast, it is claimed that individuals may not have the time or knowledge to make informed choices, or may not have reasonable alternatives available. In support of this view, Jensen and Potts showed that most privacy policies are above the reading level of the average person. [63] Therefore, this approach advocates greater government definition and enforcement of privacy standards.

Privacy law
Privacy law is the area of law concerning the protecting and preserving of privacy rights of individuals. While there is no universally accepted privacy law among all countries, some organizations promote certain concepts be enforced by individual countries. For example, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , article 12, states:

Australia
The Privacy Act 1988 is administered by the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner .
Privacy law has been evolving in Australia for a number of years. The initial introduction of privacy law in 1998 extended to the public sector, specifically to Federal government departments, under the Information Privacy Principles. State government agencies can also be subject to state based privacy legislation. This built upon the already existing privacy requirements that applied to telecommunications providers (under Part 13 of the Telecommunications Act 1997 ), and confidentiality requirements that already applied to banking, legal and patient / doctor relationships.
The Privacy Act 1988 was then extended to include the private sector in 2000 with the introduction of the National Privacy Principles. These took effect in 2001. Small businesses with an annual turnover of $3m were excluded from meeting the obligations specified in the National Privacy Principles with some exceptions such as those whose primary business was dealing in personal information.
In 2008 the Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) conducted a review of Australian Privacy Law. The resulting report For Your Information was one of the largest reports ever released by the ALRC. Amongst its many recommendations were the consolidation of both the Information Privacy Principles and the National Privacy Principles to form what is now known as the Australian Privacy Principles.
This recommendation, and many others, were taken up and implemented by the Australian Government via the Privacy Amendment (Enhancing Privacy Protection) Bill 2012 .
The Australian Privacy Principles, along with other key changes to the overall Act, took effect on 12 March 2014. The new structure of the privacy principles follow the information cycle and incorporate key emerging privacy concepts including privacy by design.
There are currently 14 Australian Privacy Principles:

Other Australian privacy laws
There are a range of other laws that provide privacy protection in Australia. These include, but are not limited to, the Telecommunications Act 1997 , Spam Act 2006 , the Do Not Call Register Act 2009 , general confidentiality obligations arising from certain professional relationships including with doctors, lawyers and other health providers, state based legislation including NSW workplace surveillance laws, state based laws that apply in NSW, Queensland and other states for the handling of health information and the handling of information by state government agencies.

Brazil
The Constitution of Brazil sets privacy as a major fundamental right. Even the State is not allowed to violate personal data, intimacy, private life, honor and image (article 5, incise X). In extreme situations, a judicial order can authorize some level of disclosure. But some data, such as correspondence, are absolutely inviolable, and not even judicial order can authorize the disclosure.
China
Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China
Article 245 Whoever unlawfully subjects another person to a body search or a search of his residence or unlawfully intrudes into another person's residence shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than three years or criminal detention. Any judicial officer who abuses his power and commits the crime mentioned in the preceding paragraph shall be given a heavier punishment.
Article 246 Whoever, by violence or other methods, publicly humiliates another person or invent stories to defame him, if the circumstances are serious, shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than three years, criminal detention, public surveillance or deprivation of political rights. The crime mentioned in the preceding paragraph shall be handled only upon complaint, except where serious harm is done to public order or to the interests of the State.
Article 252 Whoever conceals, destroys or unlawfully opens another person's letter, thereby infringing upon the citizen's right to freedom of correspondence, if the circumstances are serious, shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than one year or criminal detention.
Article 253 Any postal worker who opens without authorization or conceals or destroys mail or telegrams shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than two years or criminal detention. Whoever steals money or property by committing the crime mentioned in the preceding paragraph shall be convicted and given a heavier punishment in accordance with the provisions of Article 264 of this Law.

Canada
Canadian privacy law is governed federally by multiple acts, including the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , and the Privacy Act (Canada) . Mostly this legislation concerns privacy infringement by government organizations. Data privacy was first addressed with the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act , and provincial-level legislation also exists to account for more specific cases personal privacy protection against commercial organizations.

European Union
For Europe , Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights guarantees the right to respect for private and family life, one's home and correspondence. The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg has developed a large body of jurisprudence defining this fundamental right to privacy. [ citation needed ] The European Union requires all member states to legislate to ensure that citizens have a right to privacy, through directives such as the 1995 Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of personal data . It is regulated in the United Kingdom by the Data Protection Act 1998 and in France data protection is also monitored by the CNIL , a governmental body which must authorize legislation concerning privacy before them being enacted. In civil law jurisdictions, the right to privacy fell within the ambit of the right to a private life (droit a la vie privee) from which the tort could be claimed. Personality rights and the broader tort based interpretation of the right to privacy protected correspondence, personal information and dignity. These rights gave rise to causes for damages in most civil law jurisdictions and common law jurisdictions prior to the sui generis development of Data Protection.
Although there are comprehensive regulations for data protection, some studies show that despite the laws, there is a lack of enforcement in that no institution feels responsible to control the parties involved and enforce their laws. [64] The European Union is also championing for the 'Right to be Forgotten' concept (which allows individuals to ask that links leading to information about themselves be removed from internet search engine results) to be adopted by other countries. [65]

Italy
In Italy the right to privacy is enshrined in Article 15 of the Constitution , which states: [66]
"Freedom and confidentiality of correspondence and of every other form of communication is inviolable. Limitations may only be imposed by judicial decision stating the reasons and in accordance with the guarantees provided by the law."

United Kingdom
In the United Kingdom , it is not possible to bring an action for invasion of privacy. An action may be brought under another tort (usually breach of confidence) and privacy must then be considered under EC law. In the UK, it is sometimes a defence that disclosure of private information was in the public interest. [67] There is, however, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), an independent public body set up to promote access to official information and protect personal information. They do this by promoting good practice, ruling on eligible complaints, giving information to individuals and organisations, and taking action when the law is broken. The relevant UK laws include: Data Protection Act 1998 ; Freedom of Information Act 2000 ; Environmental Information Regulations 2004 ; Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 . The ICO has also provided a "Personal Information Toolkit" online which explains in more detail the various ways of protecting privacy online. [68]

United States
Although the Constitution does not explicitly include the right to privacy, individual as well as locational privacy are implicitly granted by the Constitution under the 4th amendment. The Supreme Court of the United States has found that other guarantees have "penumbras" that implicitly grant a right to privacy against government intrusion, for example in Griswold v. Connecticut (1965). In the United States, the right of freedom of speech granted in the First Amendment has limited the effects of lawsuits for breach of privacy. Privacy is regulated in the U.S. by the Privacy Act of 1974 , and various state laws. The Privacy Act of 1974 only applies to Federal Agencies in the executive branch of the Federal government. [69] Certain privacy rights have been established in the United States via legislation such as the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), [70] the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act (GLB), and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). [71]

Privacy Index
The Electronic Privacy Information Center 's Privacy Index puts Brazil, Australia, Japan and South Africa in the higher level of privacy (around 2.2). On the bottom of the list are the United States and United Kingdom (around 1.4). [72]

Privacy on the Internet
There are many means to protect one's privacy on the internet.
For example, e-mails can be encrypted (via S/MIME or PGP ) and anonymizing proxies or anonymizing networks like I2P and Tor can be used to prevent the internet service providers from knowing which sites one visits and with whom one communicates. Covert collection of personally identifiable information has been identified as a primary concern by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. [73] Although some privacy advocates recommend the deletion of original and third-party HTTP cookies , Anthony Miyazaki, marketing professor at Florida International University and privacy scholar, warns that the "elimination of third-party cookie use by Web sites can be circumvented by cooperative strategies with third parties in which information is transferred after the Web site's use of original domain cookies." [74] As of December 2010, the Federal Trade Commission is reviewing policy regarding this issue as it relates to behavioral advertising . [73] Another aspect of privacy on the Internet relates to online social networking. Several online social network sites (OSNs) are among the top 10 most visited websites globally. A review and evaluation of scholarly work regarding the current state of the value of individuals' privacy of online social networking show the following results: "first, adults seem to be more concerned about potential privacy threats than younger users; second, policy makers should be alarmed by a large part of users who underestimate risks of their information privacy on OSNs; third, in the case of using OSNs and its services, traditional one-dimensional privacy approaches fall short". [75] This is exacerbated by the research indicating that personal traits such as sexual orientation, race, religious and political views, personality, or intelligence can be inferred based on the wide variety of digital footprint, such as samples of text, browsing logs, or Facebook Likes. [37]

Privacy and location-based services
As location tracking capabilities of mobile devices are increasing, problems related to user privacy arise, since user's position and preferences constitute personal information and improper use of them violates user's privacy. A recent MIT study [76] [77] by de Montjoye et al. showed that 4 spatio-temporal points, approximate places and times, are enough to uniquely identify 95% of 1.5M people in a mobility database. The study further shows that these constraints hold even when the resolution of the dataset is low. Therefore, even coarse or blurred datasets provide little anonymity.
Several methods to protect user's privacy when using location-based services have been proposed, including the use of anonymizing servers, blurring of information e.a. Methods to quantify privacy have also been proposed, to be able to calculate the equilibrium between the benefit of providing accurate location information and the drawbacks of risking personal privacy. [78] Users of such services may also choose to display more generic location information (i.e. "In the City" or "Philadelphia" or "Work") to some of their more casual acquaintances while only displaying specific location information, such as their exact address, to closer contacts like spouse, relatives, and good friends.
In recent years, seen with the increasing importance of mobile devices and pared with the National Do Not Call Registry , telemarketers have turned attention to mobiles. [79] The efforts of telemarketers to use mobile devices have been met with both Federal Trade Commission and companies like PrivacyStar. Each year, thousands of complaints are filed to the FTC database with the help of companies and consumers.

Privacy by design
The principle of privacy by design states that privacy and data protection are embedded throughout the entire life cycle of technologies , from the early design stage to their deployment, use and ultimate disposal.

Privacy engineering
The practice of constructing, ostensibly, software or information systems that adhere to given privacy policies and relevant compliances is a developing area and is known as Privacy engineering

Privacy self-synchronization
Privacy self-synchronization is the mode by which the stakeholders of an enterprise privacy program spontaneously contribute collaboratively to the program's maximum success. The stakeholders may be customers, employees, managers, executives, suppliers, partners or investors. When self-synchronization is reached, the model states that the personal interests of individuals toward their privacy is in balance with the business interests of enterprises who collect and use the personal information of those individuals. [80]

Privacy paradox
Privacy paradox is a phenomenon that while online users state their concerns about privacy, their behaviors are not consistent with their concerns. [81] Susan B. Barnes firstly used the term “privacy paradox” to refer the ambiguous boundary between private and public space on social media. When compared to adults, young people tend to disclose more information on social media. However, this does not mean that they are not concerned about their privacy. Susan B. Barnes [81] gave a case in her article: in a television interview about Facebook, a student addressed her concerns about disclosing personal information online. However, when the reporter asked to see her Facebook page, she put her home address, phone numbers, and pictures of her young son on the page. She termed this phenomenon as "privacy paradox".
Afterwards, privacy paradox is studied and adopted in different research settings. Although several studies have evidenced this inconsistency between privacy attitudes and behavior among online users, the reason for the paradox still remains unclear. [82] A main explanation for privacy paradox is because users are lack of awareness of risks and privacy protection. [83] [84] [85] Users may underestimate the harm of information disclosure online. On the other hand, some researchers argue the privacy paradox comes from the limited technology literacy and the design of sites. [86] For example, users may not know how to change their default settings even though they care about their privacy. Psychologists particularly pointed out that privacy paradox shows because users have to trade-off between their privacy concerns and impression management. [87] Other individual factors such as gender, age, trust and personality, may also account for the paradox.

The right to privacy in popular culture
In the TV series West Wing , in the 1999 episode Short List , the right to privacy is an issue which arises in the appointment of a Supreme Court judge. Sam Seabourne ventures the opinion that internet privacy will be a major social issue in the next two decades. [88]

Tron (hacker)
Boris Floricic , better known by his pseudonym Tron (8 June 1972 – 17 October 1998), was a German hacker and phreaker whose death in unclear circumstances has led to various conspiracy theories . He is also known for his Diplom thesis presenting one of the first public implementations of a telephone with built-in voice encryption , the "Cryptophon".
Floricic's pseudonym was a reference to the eponymous character in the 1982 Disney film Tron . Floricic was interested in defeating computer security mechanisms; amongst other hacks, he broke the security of the German phonecard and produced working clones. He was subsequently sentenced to 15 months in jail for the physical theft of a public phone (for reverse engineering purposes) but the sentence was suspended to probation .
From December 2005 to January 2006, media attention was drawn to Floricic when his parents and Andy Müller-Maguhn brought legal action in Germany against the Wikimedia Foundation and its German chapter Wikimedia Deutschland e.V. The first preliminary injunction tried to stop Wikipedia from publishing Floricic's full name, and a second one followed, temporarily preventing the use of the German Internet domain wikipedia.de as a redirect address to the German Wikipedia .

Early life
Floricic grew up in Gropiusstadt, a suburb in southern Berlin ( West Berlin at the time). His interests in school focused on technical subjects. He left school after ten years and completed a three-year Vocational education ( Berufsausbildung ) offered by the Technical University of Berlin and graduated as a specialist in communication electronics with a major in information technology ( Kommunikationselektroniker, Fachrichtung Informationstechnik ). He subsequently earned the Abitur and began studies in computer science at the Technical University of Applied Sciences of Berlin. [ citation needed ]
During his studies, Floricic attended an internship with a company developing electronic security systems. In the winter term 1997/1998, Floricic successfully finished his studies and published his diploma thesis, in which he developed and described the " Cryptophon ", an ISDN telephone with built-in voice encryption. Since parts of this work, which were to be provided by another student, were missing, he could not finish his work on the Cryptophon. His thesis, however, was rated as exceptional by the evaluating university professor. After graduation, Floricic applied for work, but was unsuccessful. In his spare time he continued, among other activities, his work on the Cryptophon. [ citation needed ]

Interests
Floricic was highly interested in electronics and security systems of all kinds. He engaged in, amongst other things, attacks against the German phonecard and Pay TV systems. As part of his research he exchanged ideas and proposals with other hackers and scientists. On the mailing list "tv-crypt", operated by a closed group of Pay TV hackers, Floricic reported about himself in 1995 that his interests were microprocessors , programming languages , electronics of all kinds, digital radio data transmission and especially breaking the security of systems perceived as secure. He claimed to have created working clones of a chipcard used for British Pay TV and would continue his work to defeat the security of the Nagravision/Syster scrambling system which was then used by the German Pay TV provider " PREMIERE ". [ citation needed ]
Later, American scientists outlined a theoretical attack against SIM cards used for GSM mobile phones. Together with hackers from the Chaos Computer Club , Floricic successfully created a working clone of such a SIM card, thus showing the practicability of the attack. He also engaged in cloning the German phonecard and succeeded. While Floricic only wanted to demonstrate the insecurity of the system, the proven insecurity was also abused by criminals which led to the attention of law enforcement agencies and the German national phone operator Deutsche Telekom . After Deutsche Telekom changed the system, Floricic tried to remove a complete public card phone from a booth by force (using a sledgehammer ) on 3 March 1995 in order to, as he told, adapt his phonecard simulators to the latest changes. He and a friend were, however, caught by the police upon this attempt. Floricic was later sentenced to a prison term of 15 months which was suspended to probation. [ citation needed ]

Cryptophon
"Cryptophon" (or "Cryptofon") was the name Floricic chose for his prototype of an ISDN telephone with integrated voice encryption . It was created in the winter term 1997–1998 as part of his diploma thesis, titled "Realisierung einer Verschlüsselungstechnik für Daten im ISDN B-Kanal" (German, meaning, "Implementation of Cryptography for Data contained in the ISDN Bearer channel"), at the Technische Fachhochschule Berlin . Floricic focused on making the Cryptophon cheap and easy to build for hobbyists. The phone encrypts telephone calls using the symmetric encryption algorithm IDEA . As IDEA is patented, the cipher was implemented on a replaceable daughter module which would have allowed the user to exchange IDEA for another (probably patent-unencumbered) algorithm. In addition, the system was about to be supplemented with a key exchange protocol based on the asymmetric algorithm RSA in order to achieve security against compromised remote stations. [ citation needed ]
The Cryptophon is built on the foundation of an 8051 compatible microprocessor which controls the whole system and peripherals (e.g. ISDN controller, keypad and display). For the cryptography, Floricic used cheap DSPs from Texas Instruments which he scrapped out of old computer modems , but which could also be bought at affordable prices. As this type of DSP is not powerful enough for the cryptography algorithm chosen, Floricic used two of them for the Cryptophon – one for sending and one for receiving. He planned to extend the phone so it would also be possible to encrypt data-connections. Floricic developed both the operating software of the phone as well as the cryptography implementation in the DSPs. He found a new way to implement IDEA to save significant processing time. [ citation needed ]

Death
Floricic disappeared on 17 October 1998 and was found dead in a local park in Britz in the Neukölln district of Berlin on 22 October [1] after being hanged from a waistbelt wrapped around his neck. The cause of death was officially recorded as suicide . Some of his peers in the Chaos Computer Club, as well as his family members and some outside critics, have been vocal in their assertions that Floricic may have been murdered. [2] It is argued that his activities in the areas of Pay TV cracking and voice scrambling might have disturbed the affairs of an intelligence agency or organized crime enough to provide a motive. [ citation needed ]
The German journalist Burkhard Schröder published a book about the death titled Tron - Tod eines Hackers ( Tron - Death of a Hacker ) in 1999 in which he presents the facts about the case known at the time. Because he concludes that Floricic took his own life, the author was harshly criticized by both members of the Chaos Computer Club and Floricic's parents. [ citation needed ]

Naming controversy
As Floricic's family did not wish his full name (Boris Floricic) to be used, many German newspapers referred to him as "Boris F." On 14 December 2005, his parents obtained a temporary restraining order in a Berlin court against Wikimedia Foundation Inc. because its freely editable online encyclopedia, Wikipedia, mentioned the full name in its German language version. The order prohibited the Foundation from mentioning the full name on any website under the domain "wikipedia.org". It furthermore required the Foundation to name a representative in Germany within two weeks following the decision. [3]
This was widely reported in the Dutch and German press. [4] The initial order was mistakenly addressed to Saint Petersburg, Russia rather than to St. Petersburg, Florida, United States ; this was corrected five days later. [ citation needed ]
On 17 January 2006, a second preliminary injunction from a court in Berlin prohibited the Wikimedia Deutschland e.V. local chapter from linking to the German Wikipedia , resulting in the change of the wikipedia.de address from a link to German Wikipedia to a page explaining the situation, although the page did not mention Tron. [5] Despite media reports to the contrary, the German Wikipedia itself was never closed or became inaccessible in Germany. Wikimedia Deutschland e.V. confirmed to the Internet news site golem.de that the new injunction was related to the prior case against the Wikimedia Foundation and was issued on behalf of the same plaintiffs. Wikimedia Deutschland e.V. was reported as intending to fight the injunction, arguing that no valid case was presented and the freedom of the press must be defended. [6]
As Müller-Maguhn, one of the spokespersons of the Chaos Computer Club, was deeply involved in the case on the side of the plaintiffs, some media reported this as a case of Chaos Computer Club against Wikipedia. The Chaos Computer Club had issued a public statement that this was a case between a few of its members and Wikipedia, and that the CCC itself did not take any position in the matter. [7]
The Austrian online magazine Futurezone interviewed Andy Müller-Maguhn on 19 January 2006 about the case and its background. Maguhn admitted that the true reason behind the incident was a fictitious work recently published by a German author in which the main character had the same (civil) name as Floricic. The parents sent a protest to the publisher but were turned down with the argument that the German Wikipedia was using the name as well. Müller-Maguhn then asked the German Wikipedia to remove the name, but was turned down for a number of reasons, including failure to present proof that he was entitled to speak and act on behalf of the parents. [8]
On 9 February 2006, the injunction against Wikimedia Deutschland was overturned. [9] The plaintiffs appealed to the Berlin state court , but were turned down in May 2006. [ citation needed ]

Cunt
Cunt / ˈ k ʌ n t / is a vulgar word for the vulva or vagina and is also used as a term of disparagement . Reflecting different national usages , cunt is described as "an unpleasant or stupid person" in the Compact Oxford English Dictionary , whereas Merriam-Webster states that it is a "usually disparaging and obscene" term for a woman [1] or an "offensive way to refer to a woman" in the United States. [2] The Macquarie Dictionary of Australian English gives "a contemptible person". [3] When used with a positive qualifier (good, funny, clever, etc.) in Britain, New Zealand, and Australia, it can convey a positive sense of the object or person referred to. [4]
The earliest known use of the word, according to the Oxford English Dictionary , was as part of a placename of a London street, Gropecunt Lane , c. 1230. Use of the word as a term of abuse is relatively recent, dating from the late nineteenth century. [5] The word appears to have not been strongly taboo in the Middle Ages , but became taboo towards the end of the eighteenth century, and was then not generally admissible in print until the latter part of the twentieth century. The term has various derivative senses, including adjective and verb uses. Feminist writer and English professor Germaine Greer argues that cunt "is one of the few remaining words in the English language with a genuine power to shock." [6]

Etymology
The etymology of cunt is a matter of debate, [7] but most sources consider the word to have derived from a Germanic word ( Proto-Germanic *kuntō , stem *kuntōn- ), which appeared as kunta in Old Norse . Scholars are uncertain of the origin of the Proto-Germanic form itself. [8] There are cognates in most Germanic languages, such as the Swedish, Faroese and Nynorsk kunta ; West Frisian and Middle Low German kunte ; Middle Dutch conte ; Dutch kut and kont ; Middle Low German kutte ; Middle High German kotze (" prostitute "); German kott , and perhaps Old English cot . The etymology of the Proto-Germanic term is disputed. It may have arisen by Grimm's law operating on the Proto-Indo-European root *gen/gon " create, become " seen in gonads , genital , gamete , genetics , gene , or the Proto-Indo-European root *gʷneh₂/guneh₂ " woman " ( Greek : gunê , seen in gynaecology ). Relationships to similar-sounding words such as the Latin cunnus (" vulva "), and its derivatives French con , Spanish coño , and Portuguese cona , or in Persian kun ( کون ), have not been conclusively demonstrated. Other Latin words related to cunnus are cuneus (" wedge ") and its derivative cunēre (" to fasten with a wedge ", (figurative) " to squeeze in "), leading to English words such as cuneiform (" wedge-shaped "). In Middle English , cunt appeared with many spellings, such as coynte , cunte and queynte , which did not always reflect the actual pronunciation of the word.
The word in its modern meaning is attested in Middle English. Proverbs of Hendyng , a manuscript from some time before 1325, includes the advice: [9]

Offensiveness

Generally
The word cunt is generally regarded in English-speaking countries as unsuitable for normal public discourse. It has been described as "the most heavily tabooed word of all English words", [10] [11] although John Ayto, editor of the Oxford Dictionary of Slang , says " nigger " is more taboo. [12]

Feminist perspectives
Some American feminists of the 1970s sought to eliminate disparaging terms for women, including " bitch " and "cunt". [13] In the context of pornography , Catharine MacKinnon argued that use of the word acts to reinforce a dehumanisation of women by reducing them to mere body parts; [14] and in 1979 Andrea Dworkin described the word as reducing women to "the one essential – 'cunt: our essence ... our offence'". [14]
Despite criticisms, there is a movement among feminists that seeks to reclaim cunt not only as acceptable, but as an honorific , in much the same way that queer has been reappropriated by LGBT people and the word nigger has been by some African-Americans . [15] Proponents include Inga Muscio in her book, Cunt: A Declaration of Independence [16] and Eve Ensler in "Reclaiming Cunt" from The Vagina Monologues .
Germaine Greer , the feminist writer and professor of English who once published a magazine article entitled "Lady, Love Your Cunt" (anthologised in 1986), [17] discussed the origins, usage and power of the word in the BBC series Balderdash and Piffle , explaining how her views had developed over time. In the 1970s she had "championed" use of the word for the female genitalia, thinking it "shouldn't be abusive"; she rejected the "proper" word vagina , a Latin name meaning "sword-sheath" originally applied by male anatomists to all muscle coverings – not just because it refers only to the internal canal but also because of the implication that the female body is "simply a receptacle for a weapon". [18] But in 2006, referring to its use as a term of abuse, she said that, though used in some quarters as a term of affection, it had become "the most offensive insult one man could throw at another" [19] and suggested that the word was "sacred", and "a word of immense power, to be used sparingly". [6]

Usage: pre-twentieth century
Cunt has been attested in its anatomical meaning since at least the 13th century. While Francis Grose 's 1785 A Classical Dictionary of The Vulgar Tongue listed the word as "C**T: a nasty name for a nasty thing", [20] it did not appear in any major English dictionary from 1795 to 1961, when it was included in Webster's Third New International Dictionary with the comment "usu. considered obscene". Its first appearance in the Oxford English Dictionary was in 1972, which cites the word as having been in use since 1230 in what was supposedly a London street name of "Gropecunte Lane". It was, however, also used before 1230, having been brought over by the Anglo-Saxons , originally not an obscenity but rather a factual name for the vulva or vagina. Gropecunt Lane was originally a street of prostitution, a red light district . It was normal in the Middle Ages for streets to be named after the goods available for sale therein, hence the prevalence in cities having a medieval history of names such as "Silver Street" and "Fish Street". In some locations, the former name has been bowdlerised , as in the City of York, to the more acceptable "Grape Lane". [21]
The word appears several times in Chaucer 's Canterbury Tales (c. 1390), in bawdy contexts, but it does not appear to be considered obscene at this point, since it is used openly. [22] A notable use is from the " Miller's Tale ": "Pryvely he caught her by the queynte." The Wife of Bath also uses this term, "For certeyn, olde dotard, by your leave/You shall have queynte right enough at eve ... What aileth you to grouche thus and groan?/Is it for ye would have my queynte alone?" In modernised versions of these passages the word "queynte" is usually translated simply as "cunt". [23] [24] However, in Chaucer's usage there seems to be an overlap between the words "cunt" and "quaint" (possibly derived from the Latin for "known"). "Quaint" was probably pronounced in Middle English in much the same way as "cunt". It is sometimes unclear whether the two words were thought of as distinct from one another. Elsewhere in Chaucer's work the word queynte seems to be used with meaning comparable to the modern "quaint" (curious or old-fashioned, but nevertheless appealing). [25] This ambiguity was still being exploited by the 17th century; Andrew Marvell 's ... then worms shall try / That long preserved virginity, / And your quaint honour turn to dust, / And into ashes all my lust in To His Coy Mistress depends on a pun on these two senses of "quaint". [26]
By Shakespeare's day, the word seems to have become obscene. Although Shakespeare does not use the word explicitly (or with derogatory meaning) in his plays, he still uses wordplay to sneak it in obliquely. In Act III, Scene 2, of Hamlet , as the castle's residents are settling in to watch the play-within-the-play , Hamlet asks his girlfriend Ophelia , "Lady, shall I lie in your lap?" Ophelia replies, "No, my lord." Hamlet, feigning shock, says, "Do you think I meant country matters ?" Then, to drive home the point that the accent is definitely on the first syllable of country , Shakespeare has Hamlet say, "That's a fair thought, to lie between maids' legs." [27] In Twelfth Night (Act II, Scene V) the puritanical Malvolio believes he recognises his employer's handwriting in an anonymous letter, commenting "There be her very Cs, her Us, and her Ts: and thus makes she her great Ps", unwittingly punning on "cunt" and "piss", [28] and while it has also been argued that the slang term "cut" is intended, [29] Pauline Kiernan writes that Shakespeare ridicules "prissy puritanical party-poopers" by having "a Puritan spell out the word 'cunt' on a public stage". [30] A related scene occurs in Henry V : when Katherine is learning English, she is appalled at the " gros, et impudique " words "foot" and "gown", which her teacher has mispronounced as " coun ". It is usually argued that Shakespeare intends to suggest that she has misheard "foot" as " foutre " (French, "fuck") and "coun" as " con " (French "cunt", also used to mean "idiot"). [31]
Similarly John Donne alludes to the obscene meaning of the word without being explicit in his poem The Good-Morrow , referring to sucking on "country pleasures". The 1675 Restoration comedy The Country Wife also features such word play, even in its title. [ citation needed ]
By the 17th century a softer form of the word, "cunny", came into use. A well-known use of this derivation can be found in the 25 October 1668 entry of the diary of Samuel Pepys . He was discovered having an affair with Deborah Willet: he wrote that his wife "coming up suddenly, did find me imbracing the girl con [with] my hand sub [under] su [her] coats; and endeed I was with my main [hand] in her cunny. I was at a wonderful loss upon it and the girl also...." [32]
Cunny was probably derived from a pun on coney , meaning "rabbit", rather as pussy is connected to the same term for a cat. ( Philip Massinger (1583–1640) : "A pox upon your Christian cockatrices ! They cry, like poulterers' wives, 'No money, no coney.'") [33] Because of this slang use as a synonym for a taboo term, the word "coney", when it was used in its original sense to refer to rabbits, came to be pronounced as / ˈ k oʊ n i / (rhymes with "phoney"), instead of the original /ˈkʌni/ (rhymes with "honey"). Eventually the taboo association led to the word "coney" becoming deprecated entirely and replaced by the word "rabbit". [34] [35] [36] [37]
Robert Burns (1759–1796) used the word in his Merry Muses of Caledonia , a collection of bawdy verses which he kept to himself and were not publicly available until the mid-1960s. [38] In "Yon, Yon, Yon, Lassie", this couplet appears: "For ilka birss upon her cunt, Was worth a ryal ransom". [39]

Usage: modern

As a term of abuse
Merriam-Webster states it is a "usually disparaging and obscene" term for a woman, [1] and that it is an "offensive way to refer to a woman" in the United States. [2] As a broader derogatory term, it is comparable to prick and means "a fool, a dolt, an unpleasant person – of either sex". [40] [41] This sense is common in New Zealand, British and Australian English, where it is usually applied to men [42] or as referring specifically to "a despicable, contemptible or foolish" man . [43] During the 1971 Oz trial for obscenity, prosecuting counsel asked writer George Melly "Would you call your 10-year-old daughter a cunt?" Melly replied "No, because I don't think she is." [44] In the 1975 film One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest , the central character McMurphy, when pressed to explain exactly why he does not like the tyrannical Nurse Ratched, says, "Well, I don't want to break up the meeting or nothing, but she's something of a cunt, ain't she, Doc?" [45]

Other meanings
In American slang , the term can be used to refer to "a fellow male homosexual". [46] It can also be used to refer to something very difficult or unpleasant (as in "a cunt of a job"), [47] or (in British, Irish, New Zealand, and Australian English) with no negative connotations to refer to a (usually male) person. [48] In this sense, it may be modified by a positive qualifier (funny, clever, etc.). [4] For example, "This is my mate Brian. He's a good cunt."
In the Survey of English Dialects the word was recorded in some areas as meaning "the vulva of a cow". This was pronounced as [kʌnt] in Devon , and [kʊnt] in the Isle of Man , Gloucestershire and Northumberland . Possibly related was the word cunny [kʌni], with the same meaning, at Wiltshire . [49] "Coney", which also rhymes with "honey", is an old-fashioned term for a rabbit .
The word "cunty" is also known, although used rarely: a line from Hanif Kureishi 's My Beautiful Laundrette is the definition of England by a Pakistani immigrant as "eating hot buttered toast with cunty fingers", suggestive of hypocrisy and a hidden sordidness or immorality behind the country's quaint façade. This term is attributed to British novelist Henry Green . [50]
In the United States, "cunty" is sometimes used in cross-dressing drag ball culture for a drag queen that "projects feminine beauty" [51] and was the title of a hit song by Aviance . [52] A visitor to a New York drag show tells of the emcee praising a queen with "cunty, cunty, cunty" as she walks past. [53]

Frequency of use
Frequency of use varies widely in the United States. According to research into American usage carried out in 2013 and 2014 by forensic linguist Jack Grieve of Aston University and others, including researchers from the University of South Carolina , based on a corpus of nearly 9 billion words in geotagged tweets , the word was most frequently used in New England and was least frequently used in the south-eastern states. [54] [55] In Maine, it was the most frequently used "cuss word" after "asshole". [56]

Examples of use

In court
In 2016, the word was used by a judge in a British court: when a man was being sentenced to prison for breaching the terms of an ASBO in connection with using racist language, he is reported to have said to the judge that she was a "a bit of a cunt", to which the judge is reported to have replied "You're a bit of a cunt too." [57] The American blog Jezebel , reporting the story, explained that this was a British usage of the word. [58] The judge's behaviour met with a mixed reception in the British media. In one Guardian column, with the title "It's easy to cheer the judge who used the C-word. But we shouldn't", Simon Jenkins wrote "... it would take a heart of stone not to cheer." but added "Of course the judge should not have said what she said." [59]
The judge was praised on social media, but complaints were made to the Judicial Conduct Investigations Office . [60]
Another Guardian columnist, Barbara Ellen, commented on the use of the word, which was "taboo a decade ago":

Literature
James Joyce was one of the first of the major 20th-century novelists to put the word "cunt" into print. In the context of one of the central characters in Ulysses , Leopold Bloom , Joyce refers to the Dead Sea and to
Joyce uses the word figuratively rather than literally; but while Joyce used the word only once in Ulysses , with four other wordplays ('cunty') on it, D H Lawrence used the word ten times in Lady Chatterley's Lover , in a more direct sense. [63] Mellors, the gamekeeper and eponymous lover, tries delicately to explain the definition of the word to Lady Constance Chatterley:
The novel was the subject of an unsuccessful UK prosecution in 1961 against its publishers, Penguin Books , on grounds of obscenity. [64]
Henry Miller 's novel Tropic of Cancer uses the word extensively, ensuring its banning in Britain between 1934 and 1961 [65] and being the subject of the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Grove Press, Inc. v. Gerstein , 378 U.S. 577 (1964).
Samuel Beckett was an associate of Joyce, and in his Malone Dies (1956), he writes: "His young wife had abandoned all hope of bringing him to heel, by means of her cunt, that trump card of young wives." [66]
In 1998, Inga Muscio published Cunt: A Declaration of Independence .
In Ian McEwan 's 2001 novel Atonement , set in 1935, the word is used in a love letter mistakenly sent instead of a revised version, and although not spoken, is an important plot pivot. [67]

Art
The word is occasionally used in the titles of works of art, such as Peter Renosa's "I am the Cunt of Western Civilization".

Theatre
Theatre censorship was effectively abolished in the UK in 1968 ; prior to that all theatrical productions had to be vetted by the Lord Chamberlain's Office . English stand-up comedian Roy "Chubby" Brown claims that he was the first person to say the word on stage in the United Kingdom. [68]
In the 1996 play The Vagina Monologues the author, American writer Eve Ensler , says she has reclaimed the word and encourages the audience to repeat it with her. "Feeling a little irritated in the airport, just say 'cunt,' everything changes", she says. "Try it, go ahead, go ahead. Cunt. Cunt. Cunt." [69]

Television
Broadcast media are regulated for content, and media providers such as the BBC have guidelines as to how "cunt" and similar words should be treated. [70] In a survey of 2000 commissioned by the British Broadcasting Standards Commission , Independent Television Commission , BBC and Advertising Standards Authority , "cunt" was regarded as the most offensive word which could be heard, above " motherfucker " and " fuck ". [71] Nevertheless, there have been occasions when, particularly in a live broadcast, the word has been aired outside editorial control:
The first scripted uses of the word on British television occurred in 1979, in the ITV drama No Mama No . [28] [72] In Jerry Springer – The Opera (BBC, 2005), the suggestion that the Christ character might be gay was found more controversial than the chant describing the Devil as "cunting, cunting, cunting, cunting cunt". [76] The first scripted use on US television was on the Larry Sanders Show in 1992, and a notable use occurred in Sex and the City . [28]
In July 2007 BBC Three broadcast an hour-long documentary, entitled The 'C' Word , about the origins, use and evolution of the word from the early 1900s to the present day. Presented by British comedian Will Smith , viewers were taken to a street in Oxford once called " Gropecunt Lane " and presented with examples of the acceptability of "cunt" as a word. [77] In the US, an episode of the NBC TV show 30 Rock , titled " The C Word ", centred around a subordinate calling protagonist Liz Lemon ( Tina Fey ) a "cunt" and her subsequent efforts to regain her staff's favour. [ citation needed ] (Note that "the C-word" is also a long-standing euphemism for cancer; Lisa Lynch 's book led to a BBC1 drama, both with that title. [78] ) Jane Fonda uttered the word on a live airing of the Today Show , a network broadcast-TV news program, in 2008 when being interviewed about The Vagina Monologues . [79]

Radio
On 6 December 2010 on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme , presenter James Naughtie referred to the British Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt as Jeremy Cunt; [80] he covered this up explaining it as being a cough but still ended up giggling over his words while announcing the rest of the items in the next hour. [ citation needed ] In the programme following, about an hour later, Andrew Marr referred to the incident during Start the Week where it was said that "we won't repeat the mistake" whereupon Marr slipped up in the same way as Naughtie had. The use of the word was described by the BBC as being "...an offensive four-letter word..." [ citation needed ]

Film
The word appears in graffiti on a wall in the 1969 film Bronco Bullfrog . [81] The first verbal use of the word in mainstream cinema occurs in Carnal Knowledge (1971), in which Jonathan ( Jack Nicholson ) asks, "Is this an ultimatum? Answer me, you ball-busting, castrating, son of a cunt bitch! Is this an ultimatum or not?" In the same year, the word was used in the film Women in Revolt , in which Holly Woodlawn shouts "I love cunt" whilst avoiding a violent boyfriend. [82] Nicholson later used it again, in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975). [83] Two early films by Martin Scorsese , Mean Streets (1973) and Taxi Driver (1976), use the word in the context of the virgin-whore dichotomy , with characters using it after they were rejected (in Mean Streets ) or after they have slept with the woman (in Taxi Driver ). [84]
In notable instances, the word has been edited out. Saturday Night Fever (1977) was released in two versions, "R" (Restricted) and "PG" (Parental Guidance), the latter omitting or replacing dialogue such as Tony Manero ( John Travolta )'s comment to Annette ( Donna Pescow ), "It's a decision a girl's gotta make early in life, if she's gonna be a nice girl or a cunt". [28] This differential persists, and in The Silence of the Lambs (1991), Agent Starling ( Jodie Foster ) meets Dr. Hannibal Lecter ( Anthony Hopkins ) for the first time and passes the cell of "Multiple Miggs", who says to Starling: "I can smell your cunt." In versions of the film edited for television the word is dubbed with the word scent . [85] The 2010 film Kick-Ass caused a controversy when the word was used by Hit-Girl because the actress playing the part, Chloë Grace Moretz , was 11 years old at the time of filming. [86] [87]
In Britain, use of the word "cunt" may result in an "18" rating from the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC), and this happened to Ken Loach 's film Sweet Sixteen , because of an estimated twenty uses of "cunt". [88] Still, the BBFC's guidelines at "15" state that "very strong language may be permitted, depending on the manner in which it is used, who is using the language, its frequency within the work as a whole and any special contextual justification." [89] Also directed by Loach, My Name is Joe was given a 15 certificate despite more than one instance of the word. [90] The 2010 Ian Dury biopic Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll was given a "15" rating despite containing seven uses of the word. [91]

Comedy
In their Derek and Clive dialogues, Peter Cook and Dudley Moore , particularly Cook, arguably made the word more accessible in the UK; in the 1976 sketch "This Bloke Came Up To Me", "cunt" is used approximately thirty-five times. [92] The word is also used extensively by British comedian Roy 'Chubby' Brown , which ensures that his stand-up act has never been fully shown on UK television. [68]
Australian stand-up comedian Rodney Rude frequently refers to his audiences as "cunts" and makes frequent use of the word in his acts, which got him arrested in Queensland and Western Australia for breaching obscenity laws of those states in the mid-1980s. Australian comedic singer Kevin Bloody Wilson makes extensive use of the word, most notably in the songs Caring Understanding Nineties Type and You Can't Say "Cunt" in Canada . [93]
The word appears in American comic George Carlin 's 1972 standup routine on the list of the seven dirty words that could not, at that time, be said on American broadcast television, a routine that led to a U. S. Supreme Court decision. [94] While some of the original seven are now heard on US broadcast television from time to time, "cunt" remains generally taboo except on premium paid subscription cable channels like HBO or Showtime. Comedian Louis C. K. uses the term frequently in his stage act as well as on his television show Louie on FX network, which bleeps it out.

Music
The 1977 Ian Dury and The Blockheads album, New Boots and Panties used the word in the opening line of the track "Plaistow Patricia", thus: "Arseholes, bastards, fucking cunts and pricks", [95] particularly notable as there is no musical lead-in to the lyrics. [ citation needed ]
In 1979, during a concert at New York's Bottom Line , Carlene Carter introduced a song about mate-swapping called "Swap-Meat Rag" by stating, "If this song don't put the cunt back in country, I don't know what will." [96] The comment was quoted widely in the press, and Carter spent much of the next decade trying to live the comment down. [97] However use of the word in lyrics is not recorded before the Sid Vicious 's 1978 version of " My Way ", which marked the first known use of the word in a UK top 10 hit, as a line was changed to "You cunt/I'm not a queer". [98] The following year, "cunt" was used more explicitly in the song "Why D'Ya Do It?" from Marianne Faithfull 's album Broken English :
The Happy Mondays song, "Kuff Dam" (i.e. "Mad fuck" in reverse), from their 1987 debut album, Squirrel and G-Man Twenty Four Hour Party People Plastic Face Carnt Smile (White Out) , includes the lyrics "You see that Jesus is a cunt / And never helped you with a thing that you do, or you don't." Biblical scholar James Crossley, writing in the academic journal, Biblical Interpretation , analyses the Happy Mondays' reference to "Jesus is a cunt" as a description of the "useless assistance" of a now "inadequate Jesus". [100] A phrase from the same lyric, "Jesus is a cunt" was included on the notorious Cradle of Filth T-shirt which depicted a masturbating nun on the front and the slogan "Jesus is a cunt" in large letters on the back. The T-shirt was banned in New Zealand, in 2008. [101]
Liz Phair in "Dance of Seven Veils" on her 1993 album Exile in Guyville , uses the word in the line "I only ask because I'm a real cunt in spring". Liz Phair (22 June 1993). Exile in Guyville (Double LP) (vinyl). Matador Records, OLE 051-1.
The word has been used by numerous non-mainstream bands, such as Australian band TISM , who released an extended play in 1993 Australia the Lucky Cunt (a reference to Australia's label the "lucky country"). They also released a single in 1998 entitled " I Might Be a Cunt, but I'm Not a Fucking Cunt ", which was banned. The American grindcore band Anal Cunt , on being signed to a bigger label, shortened their name to AxCx. [ citation needed ]
The word appears once in Nicki Minaj 's 2010 song " Roman's Revenge ." The song includes the lyric "I'm a bad bitch, I'm a cunt." [102]
More recently, in 2012, the word appears at least 10 times in Azealia Banks ' song " 212 ". She is also known to refer to her fans on Facebook as "kuntz". Banks has said she is "tired" of defending her profanity-laden lyrics from critics, saying they reflect her everyday speech and experiences. [103]

Computer and video games
The 2004 video game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas was the first major video game to use the word, [104] along with being the first in the series to use the words nigga , motherfucker , and cocksucker . It was used just once, by the British character Kent Paul (voiced by Danny Dyer ), who refers to Maccer as a "soppy cunt" in the mission Don Peyote. [105]
The 2004 title The Getaway: Black Monday by SCEE used the word several times during the game. [106]
In the 2008 title Grand Theft Auto IV (developed by Rockstar North and distributed by Take Two Interactive ), the word, amongst many other expletives, was used by James Pegorino who, after finding out that his personal bodyguard had turned states , exclaimed "The world is a cunt!" while aiming a shotgun at the player. [107]

Other uses
Popular singer, Rihanna , has been outspoken about her use of the word "cunt". She was photographed in 2011 wearing a necklace spelling the word. She later explained why she uses it in an interview with British Vogue . The Barbados-born singer said she "never knew" that the word was offensive until she moved to the United States. [108]

Linguistic variants and derivatives
Various euphemisms , minced forms and in-jokes are used to imply the word without actually saying it, thereby escaping obvious censure and censorship.

Spoonerisms
Deriving from a dirty joke : "What's the difference between a circus and a strip club?"- "The circus has a bunch of cunning stunts...." [109] The phrase cunning stunt has been used in popular music. Its first documented appearance was by the English band Caravan , who released the album Cunning Stunts in July 1975; [110] the title was later used by Metallica for a CD/Video compilation , and in 1992 the Cows released an album with the same title . In his 1980s BBC television programme, Kenny Everett played a vapid starlet, Cupid Stunt . [111]

Acronyms
There are numerous informal acronyms, including various apocryphal stories concerning academic establishments, such as the Cambridge University National Trust Society . [112]
There are many variants of the covering phrase " See you next Tuesday ". Creative works with that phrase as a title include a play by Ronald Harwood , the second album by hip hop group FannyPack, a 2013 independent film by Drew Tobia, a song by deathcore band The Acacia Strain on their 2006 album The Dead Walk , a song by Kesha from the 2010 EP Cannibal , and an experimental deathcore band .
A more recent acronym is "Can't Use New Technology" which is thought to originate from IT staff. [ citation needed ]

Puns
The name "Mike Hunt" is a frequent pun on my cunt ; it has been used in a scene from the movie Porky's , [113] and for a character in the BBC radio comedy Radio Active in the 1980s. [114] "Has Anyone Seen Mike Hunt?" were the words written on a "pink neon sculpture" representing the letter C, in a 2004 exhibition of the alphabet at the British Library in collaboration with the International Society of Typographic Designers . [115] [116]
As well as obvious references, there are also allusions. On I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue , Stephen Fry once defined countryside as the act of "murdering Piers Morgan ". [117] In Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps , Donna and Gaz are perusing erotic novels when they come across The Count of Monte Cristo ; Gaz helpfully informs Donna that 'it doesn't say Count'. [118] Similarly, in an episode of Spaced , Sophie tells Tim that she can't see him as there's been a misprint on the title of one of the magazines she works on – Total Cult . [119] In all these uses, the audience are left to make the connection.
Even Parliaments are not immune from punning uses; as recalled by former Australian prime minister Gough Whitlam :
and Mark Lamarr used a variation of this same gag on BBC TV's Never Mind the Buzzcocks . " Stuart Adamson was a Big Country member... and we do remember". [121]

Rhyming slang
Several celebrities have had their names used as euphemisms, including footballer Roger Hunt , [122] actor Gareth Hunt , [123] [124] [125] singer James Blunt , [115] politician Jeremy Hunt , [126] and 1970s motor-racing driver James Hunt , whose name was once used to introduce the British radio show I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue as "the show that is to panel games what James Hunt is to rhyming slang". [115]
An old canting form is berk , short for " Berkeley Hunt " or "Berkshire Hunt", [127] [128] and in a Monty Python sketch, an idioglossiac man replaces the initial "c" of words with "b", producing "silly bunt". Scottish comedian Chic Murray claimed to have worked for a firm called "Lunt, Hunt & Cunningham". [129]

Derived meanings
The word "cunt" forms part of some technical terms used in seafaring and other industries.

List of Wikimedia chapters
Wikimedia chapters are national or sub-national not-for-profit organisations created to promote the interests of Wikimedia projects locally. Chapters are legally independent of the Wikimedia Foundation , entering into a "Chapters Agreement" with the Foundation following acceptance by the Affiliations Committee (formerly known as "Chapters Committee"), and have no control over Foundation websites. They organise regional conferences, outreach and global events such as Wikimania . [1] [2] As of January 2015 there were 41 recognised Wikimedia chapters. [3] [4]

Wiki software
Wiki software (also known as a wiki engine or wiki application [ citation needed ] ) is a collaborative software that runs a wiki , which allows users to create and collaboratively edit "pages" or entries via a web browser . A wiki system is usually a web application that runs on one or more web servers . The content, including all current and previous revisions, is usually stored in either a file system or a database . Wikis are a type of web content management system , and the most commonly supported off-the-shelf software that web hosting facilities offer. There are currently dozens of actively maintained wiki engines, in a variety of programming languages, including both open source and proprietary applications. These vary widely in their platform support, their support for natural language characters and conventions, and in their assumptions about technical versus social control of editing.

History
The first generally recognized 'wiki' application, WikiWikiWeb , was created by American computer programmer Ward Cunningham in 1994 and launched on c2.com in 1995. [1] "WikiWikiWeb" was also the name of the wiki that ran on the software, and in the first years of wikis' existence there was no great distinction made between the contents of wikis and the software they ran on, possibly because almost every wiki ran on its own customized software. The WikiWikiWeb software was later [ when? ] renamed "WikiBase".
Wiki software originated from older version control systems used for documentation and software in the 1980s. By the mid-1990s these generally had web browser interfaces. However, they lacked the ability to easily create links between internal pages without writing HTML code. For WikiWikiWeb, the CamelCase naming convention was used to indicate internal links, without requiring HTML code.
By the time MediaWiki appeared, this convention had been largely abandoned in favor of explicitly marking links in edited source code with double square brackets. Page names thus did not interrupt the flow of English and could follow standard English capitalization convention. Case-sensitivity on the first letter but not subsequent letters supported standard English capitalization conventions and let writers author their pages in ordinary English, with the linking of particular words and phrases afterward. This proved to be the critical change that allowed ordinary authors of English to write wiki pages, and non-technical users to read them. This policy was extended to other natural languages, avoiding the use of unusual-looking text or awkward capitalization that violates the language's own rules.
Over the next 10 years, many more wiki applications were written, in a variety of programming languages. After 2005, there began to be a move toward increasing consolidation and standardization: many less-popular wiki applications were gradually abandoned, and fewer new applications were created. Relatively few of the wiki engines currently in use were created after 2006.
Wiki functionality has also been added to existing content management systems , such as Microsoft SharePoint .

Data compatibility
In general new wiki engines have not followed the data formats of the existing engines, making them of limited use for those who have already invested in large knowledge bases in existing software. As a rule newer wiki projects have not succeeded in attracting large numbers of users from the existing wiki software base.
Only one data format has ever been implemented in more than one wiki, that being MediaWiki's:
None of these alternatives support the extensions available under standard MediaWiki, some of which extend or alter its data format.

Types of usage
There are essentially three types of usage for wiki software: public-facing wikis with a potentially large community of readers and editors, private enterprise wikis for data management by corporations and other organizations, and personal wikis , meant to be used by a single person to manage notes, and usually run on a desktop. Some wiki software is specifically geared for one of the usage types, while other software can be used for all three, but contains functionality, either in its core or through plugins, that help with one or more of the usage types.

Public wikis
Public wikis are wikis that can be read by anyone; usually (though not always), the contents can be edited by anyone as well, though sometimes registration is required. Among public wikis, MediaWiki is the dominant software: it powers the world's most popular (as per August, 2015) public wiki, [2] Wikipedia (free), as well as the most popular wiki farm, Wikia (commercial), and it is the most popular software in use on other public wikis as well. [3] Other wiki engines used regularly for public wikis include MoinMoin and PmWiki , along with many others . [3]

Enterprise wikis
Enterprise wiki software is software meant to be used in a corporate (or organizational) context, [4] especially to enhance internal knowledge sharing . It tends to have a greater emphasis on features like access control, integration with other software, and document management . Most proprietary wiki applications specifically market themselves as enterprise solutions, including Confluence , eXo Platform , Socialtext , Jive , and Traction TeamPage . In addition, some open source wiki applications also describe themselves as enterprise solutions, including XWiki , Foswiki [5] and TWiki . [6] Some open-source wiki applications, though they do not specifically bill themselves as enterprise solutions, have marketing materials geared for enterprise users, like Tiki Wiki CMS Groupware [7] and MediaWiki . [8] Many other wiki applications have also been used within enterprises.
Among the many companies and government organizations that use wikis internally are Adobe Systems , Amazon.com , Intel , Microsoft , and the United States intelligence community .
Within organizations, wikis may either add to or replace centrally managed content management systems. Their decentralized nature allows them, in principle, to disseminate needed information across an organization more rapidly and more cheaply than a centrally controlled knowledge repository. Wikis can also be used for document management , project management , customer relationship management , enterprise resource planning , and many other kinds of data management.
Features of wikis specifically helpful to a corporation include:

Personal wikis
Software that is specifically designed for running personal wikis includes NotePub , Pimki , Tomboy , WikidPad , and ConnectedText . Other, more general, wiki applications have components geared for individual users, including MoinMoin (which offers a "DesktopEdition" [9] ) and TiddlyWiki , Wiki on a Stick (a Single-page application with no server required).

Editing
Most wiki software uses a special syntax, known as wiki markup , for users to format the text, instead of requiring them to enter in HTML . Some wiki applications also include a WYSIWYG editor, either instead of or in addition to the wiki markup editing.

Hosted application
There are a variety of wiki hosting services , otherwise known as wiki farms, that host users' wikis on a server. Some wiki software is only available in hosted form: PBworks , Wetpaint and Wikispaces are all examples of wiki hosting services that run on code that is only available on those sites. Other wiki software is available in both hosted and downloadable form, including Tettra , Confluence , Socialtext , MediaWiki (available on Wikia and EditThis.info, among other sites) and XWiki (see also XWiki Cloud ).

Additional features

Content-management features
Wiki software can include features that come with traditional content management systems, such as calendars, to-do lists, blogs and discussion forums. All of these can either be stored via versioned wiki pages, or simply be a separate piece of functionality. Software that supports blogs with wiki-style editing and versioning is sometimes known as "bliki" software.
Tiki Wiki CMS Groupware is an example of wiki software that is designed to support such features at its core. Many of the enterprise wiki applications, such as TWiki , Confluence and SharePoint , also support such features, as do open-source applications like MediaWiki and XWiki , via plugins . [10]

Scripting
Some wiki applications let users embed scripting -style calls into wiki pages, which are processed by the wiki's parser and run either when the page is saved or when it is displayed. XWiki and MediaWiki are examples of such an application. [11]
Specifically XWiki offers support for the following scripting languages: Groovy , Velocity , Ruby , Python , PHP or more generally any JSR223 scripting language.

Semantic annotation
Wiki software can let users store data via the wiki, in a way that can be exported via the Semantic Web , or queried internally within the wiki. A wiki that allows such annotation is known as a semantic wiki . The current best-known semantic wiki software is Semantic MediaWiki , a plugin to MediaWiki.

Mobile access
Some wiki software have special handling for accessing by mobile devices, such as mobile phones . This is usually done by displaying conservative HTML coding. [12] [13]

Offline viewing and editing
Various approaches to providing wiki functionality when the user is not online have been tried. For users who need to simply read the wiki's content when offline, a copy of the content can often be made easily; in the case of Wikipedia, CD-ROMs and printed versions have been made of parts of Wikipedia's content.
Allowing offline editing, however (where the changes are synchronized when the user is back online), is a much more difficult process. One approach to doing this is using a distributed revision control system as a backend of the wiki, in peer-to-peer style. With this approach, there is no central store of the wiki's content; instead, every user keeps a complete copy of the wiki locally, and the software handles merging and propagating of changes when they are made. This is the approach taken by the ikiwiki engine (which can use the distributed revision control system Git as its back-end), and Code Co-op (a distributed revision control system that includes a wiki component).

Distributing and decentralizing
Wiki software can be distributed ,. [14] XWiki is able to function in this way. [15] Smallest Federated Wiki promotes a federation of wiki servers, [16]
There has also been research done on allowing Wikipedia to be run as a decentralized wiki. [17] [18]

Notes

Variable (computer science)
In computer programming , a variable or scalar is a storage location paired with an associated symbolic name (an identifier ), which contains some known or unknown quantity of information referred to as a value . The variable name is the usual way to reference the stored value; this separation of name and content allows the name to be used independently of the exact information it represents. The identifier in computer source code can be bound to a value during run time , and the value of the variable may thus change during the course of program execution .
Variables in programming may not directly correspond to the concept of variables in mathematics . The value of a computing variable is not necessarily part of an equation or formula as in mathematics. In computing, a variable may be employed in a repetitive process — assigned a value in one place, then used elsewhere, then reassigned a new value and used again in the same way (see iteration ). Variables in computer programming are frequently given long names to make them relatively descriptive of their use, whereas variables in mathematics often have terse, one- or two-character names for brevity in transcription and manipulation.
A variable storage location may be referred by several different identifiers, a situation known as aliasing . Assigning a value to the variable using one of the identifiers will change the value that can be accessed through the other identifiers.
Compilers have to replace variables' symbolic names with the actual locations of the data. While a variable's name, type, and location often remain fixed, the data stored in the location may be changed during program execution.

Actions on a variable
In imperative programming languages , values can generally be accessed or changed at any time. However, in pure functional and logic languages , variables are bound to expressions and keep a single value during their entire lifetime due to the requirements of referential transparency . In imperative languages, the same behavior is exhibited by constants , which are typically contrasted with normal variables.
Depending on the type system of a programming language, variables may only be able to store a specified datatype (e.g. integer or string ). Alternatively, a datatype may be associated only with the current value, allowing a single variable to store anything supported by the programming language.

Identifiers referencing a variable
An identifier referencing a variable can be used to access the variable in order to read out the value, or alter the value, or edit the attributes of the variable, such as access permission, locks , semaphores , etc.
For instance, a variable might be referenced by the identifier " total_count " and the variable can contain the number 1956. If the same variable is referenced by the identifier " x " as well, and if using this identifier " x ", the value of the variable is altered to 2009, then reading the value using the identifier " total_count " will yield a result of 2009 and not 1956.
If a variable is only referenced by a single identifier that can simply be called the name of the variable . Otherwise, we can speak of one of the names of the variable . For instance, in the previous example, the " total_count " is a name of the variable in question, and " x " is another name of the same variable.

Scope and extent
The scope of a variable describes where in a program's text the variable may be used, while the extent (or lifetime ) describes when in a program's execution a variable has a (meaningful) value. The scope of a variable is actually a property of the name of the variable, and the extent is a property of the variable itself. These should not be confused with context (also called environment ), which is a property of the program, and varies by point in the source code or execution – see scope: overview . Further, object lifetime may coincide with variable lifetime, but in many cases is not tied to variable lifetime.
A variable name's scope affects its extent .
Scope is an important part of the name resolution of a variable. Most languages define a specific scope for each variable (as well as any other named entity), which may differ within a given program. The scope of a variable is the portion of the program code for which the variable's name has meaning and for which the variable is said to be "visible". Entrance into that scope typically begins a variable's lifetime (as it comes into context) and exit from that scope typically ends its lifetime (as it goes out of context). For instance, a variable with " lexical scope " is meaningful only within a certain function/ subroutine , or more finely within a block of expressions/statements (accordingly with function scope or block scope ); this is static resolution, performable at parse-time or compile-time. Alternatively, a variable with dynamic scope is resolved at run-time, based on a global binding stack that depends on the specific control flow. Variables only accessible within a certain functions are termed " local variables ". A " global variable ", or one with indefinite scope, may be referred to anywhere in the program.
Extent , on the other hand, is a runtime ( dynamic ) aspect of a variable. Each binding of a variable to a value can have its own extent at runtime. The extent of the binding is the portion of the program's execution time during which the variable continues to refer to the same value or memory location. A running program may enter and leave a given extent many times, as in the case of a closure .
Unless the programming language features garbage collection , a variable whose extent permanently outlasts its scope can result in a memory leak , whereby the memory allocated for the variable can never be freed since the variable which would be used to reference it for deallocation purposes is no longer accessible. However, it can be permissible for a variable binding to extend beyond its scope, as occurs in Lisp closures and C static local variables ; when execution passes back into the variable's scope, the variable may once again be used. A variable whose scope begins before its extent does is said to be uninitialized and often has an undefined, arbitrary value if accessed (see wild pointer ), since it has yet to be explicitly given a particular value. A variable whose extent ends before its scope may become a dangling pointer and deemed uninitialized once more since its value has been destroyed. Variables described by the previous two cases may be said to be out of extent or unbound . In many languages, it is an error to try to use the value of a variable when it is out of extent. In other languages, doing so may yield unpredictable results . Such a variable may, however, be assigned a new value, which gives it a new extent.
For space efficiency, a memory space needed for a variable may be allocated only when the variable is first used and freed when it is no longer needed. A variable is only needed when it is in scope, but beginning each variable's lifetime when it enters scope may give space to unused variables. To avoid wasting such space, compilers often warn programmers if a variable is declared but not used.
It is considered good programming practice to make the scope of variables as narrow as feasible so that different parts of a program do not accidentally interact with each other by modifying each other's variables. Doing so also prevents action at a distance . Common techniques for doing so are to have different sections of a program use different name spaces , or to make individual variables "private" through either dynamic variable scoping or lexical variable scoping .
Many programming languages employ a reserved value (often named null or nil ) to indicate an invalid or uninitialized variable.

Typing
In statically typed languages such as Java or ML , a variable also has a type , meaning that only certain kinds of values can be stored in it. For example, a variable of type " integer " is prohibited from storing text values.
In dynamically typed languages such as Python , it is values, not variables, which carry type. In Common Lisp , both situations exist simultaneously: A variable is given a type (if undeclared, it is assumed to be T , the universal supertype ) which exists at compile time. Values also have types, which can be checked and queried at runtime.
Typing of variables also allows polymorphisms to be resolved at compile time. However, this is different from the polymorphism used in object-oriented function calls (referred to as virtual functions in C++ ) which resolves the call based on the value type as opposed to the supertypes the variable is allowed to have.
Variables often store simple data, like integers and literal strings, but some programming languages allow a variable to store values of other datatypes as well. Such languages may also enable functions to be parametric polymorphic . These functions operate like variables to represent data of multiple types. For example, a function named length may determine the length of a list. Such a length function may be parametric polymorphic by including a type variable in its type signature , since the amount of elements in the list is independent of the elements' types.

Parameters
The formal parameters of functions are also referred to as variables. For instance, in this Python code segment,
The variable named x is a parameter because it is given a value when the function is called. The integer 5 is the argument which gives x its value. In most languages, function parameters have local scope. This specific variable named x can only be referred to within the addtwo function (though of course other functions can also have variables called x ).

Memory allocation
The specifics of variable allocation and the representation of their values vary widely, both among programming languages and among implementations of a given language. Many language implementations allocate space for local variables , whose extent lasts for a single function call on the call stack , and whose memory is automatically reclaimed when the function returns. More generally, in name binding , the name of a variable is bound to the address of some particular block (contiguous sequence) of bytes in memory, and operations on the variable manipulate that block. Referencing is more common for variables whose values have large or unknown sizes when the code is compiled. Such variables reference the location of the value instead of storing the value itself, which is allocated from a pool of memory called the heap .
Bound variables have values. A value, however, is an abstraction, an idea; in implementation, a value is represented by some data object , which is stored somewhere in computer memory. The program, or the runtime environment , must set aside memory for each data object and, since memory is finite, ensure that this memory is yielded for reuse when the object is no longer needed to represent some variable's value.
Objects allocated from the heap must be reclaimed—especially when the objects are no longer needed. In a garbage-collected language (such as C# , Java , and Lisp ), the runtime environment automatically reclaims objects when extant variables can no longer refer to them. In non-garbage-collected languages, such as C , the program (and the programmer) must explicitly allocate memory, and then later free it, to reclaim its memory. Failure to do so leads to memory leaks , in which the heap is depleted as the program runs, risks eventual failure from exhausting available memory.
When a variable refers to a data structure created dynamically, some of its components may be only indirectly accessed through the variable. In such circumstances, garbage collectors (or analogous program features in languages that lack garbage collectors) must deal with a case where only a portion of the memory reachable from the variable needs to be reclaimed.

Naming conventions
Unlike their mathematical counterparts, programming variables and constants commonly take multiple-character names, e.g. COST or total . Single-character names are most commonly used only for auxiliary variables; for instance, i , j , k for array index variables.
Some naming conventions are enforced at the language level as part of the language syntax and involve the format of valid identifiers. In almost all languages, variable names cannot start with a digit (0–9) and cannot contain whitespace characters. Whether, which, and when punctuation marks are permitted in variable names varies from language to language; many languages only permit the underscore ("_") in variable names and forbid all other punctuation. In some programming languages, specific (often punctuation) characters (known as sigils ) are prefixed or appended to variable identifiers to indicate the variable's type.
Case-sensitivity of variable names also varies between languages and some languages require the use of a certain case in naming certain entities; [note 1] Most modern languages are case-sensitive; some older languages are not. Some languages reserve certain forms of variable names for their own internal use; in many languages, names beginning with two underscores ("__") often fall under this category.
However, beyond the basic restrictions imposed by a language, the naming of variables is largely a matter of style. At the machine code level, variable names are not used, so the exact names chosen do not matter to the computer. Thus names of variables identify them, for the rest they are just a tool for programmers to make programs easier to write and understand. Using poorly chosen variable names can make code more difficult to review than non-descriptive names, so names which are clear are often encouraged. [1] [2]
Programmers often create and adhere to code style guidelines which offer guidance on naming variables or impose a precise naming scheme. Shorter names are faster to type but are less descriptive; longer names often make programs easier to read and the purpose of variables easier to understand. However, extreme verbosity in variable names can also lead to less comprehensible code.

UseModWiki
UseModWiki is a wiki engine written in the Perl programming language. It is licensed under the GNU General Public License . Pages in UseModWiki are stored in ordinary files , not in a relational database . Something similar to the interface can be seen in MediaWiki with the classic skin. [ clarification needed ]

History
Clifford Adams based UseModWiki on the code of AtisWiki by Robert Wayne. [1] AtisWiki was based on CvWiki by Peter Merel. [1] CvWiki was the first GNU-licensed wiki based on WikiBase, the wiki engine of the original WikiWikiWeb by Ward Cunningham . [1]
The first installation of UseModWiki was Adams's usemod.com wiki, the basis of the Use net Mod eration Project (Usemod) which had been running on AtisWiki since October 11, 1999. The second wiki to use UseModWiki, the MeatballWiki created by Adams and Sunir Shah dedicated to online communities, was installed on the usemod.com Web site on April 24, 2000. It was later used on Nupedia . [1]
From January 15, 2001 until early 2002, UseModWiki was also used to run Wikipedia . All language instances of Wikipedia have since been moved over to MediaWiki .
WikiWikiWeb 's sister wiki the Adjunct , started in July 2005, also runs on UseModWiki.
UseMod was also used by Peter Harrison, webmaster of the Festiniog Railway Heritage Group , to run its wiki, which had no name and was originally referred to as "the Heritage Group Wiki". In 2006, Harrison heavily modified UseMod 1.0 to run the site, now known as Festipedia. The modified version was called FestWiki, and was very similar in both appearance and functionality to the MediaWiki of the time combined with most of the extensions in use on the English Wikipedia. The site used FestWiki until 2010, when it was migrated to MediaWiki 1.16.0. [2]
Adams is credited with the idea and software coding to use double brackets "[[" in Wikipedia to replace the use of CamelCase on the early versions of wikis. [3]

Exponential growth
Exponential growth is feasible when the growth rate of the value of a mathematical function is proportional to the function's current value, resulting in its growth with time being an exponential function , i.e., a function in which the time value is the exponent. Exponential decay occurs in the same way when the growth rate is negative. In the case of a discrete domain of definition with equal intervals, it is also called geometric growth or geometric decay , the function values forming a geometric progression . In either exponential growth or exponential decay, the ratio of the rate of change of the quantity to its current size remains constant over time.
The formula for exponential growth of a variable x at the growth rate r , as time t goes on in discrete intervals (that is, at integer times 0, 1, 2, 3, ...), is
where x 0 is the value of x at time 0. This formula is transparent when the exponents are converted to multiplication. For instance, with a starting value of 50 and a growth rate of r = 5% = 0.05 per interval, the passage of one interval would give 50 ( 1.05 ) 1 {\displaystyle 50(1.05)^{1}} , or simply 50×1.05; two intervals would give 50 ( 1.05 ) 2 {\displaystyle 50(1.05)^{2}} , or simply 50×1.05×1.05; and three intervals would give 50 ( 1.05 ) 3 {\displaystyle 50(1.05)^{3}} , or simply 50×1.05×1.05×1.05. In this way, each increase in the exponent by a full interval can be seen to increase the previous total by another five percent. (The order of multiplication does not change the result based on the associative property of multiplication.)
Since the time variable, which is the input to this function, occurs as the exponent, this is an exponential function .

Examples

Basic formula
A quantity x depends exponentially on time t if
where the constant a is the initial value of x ,
the constant b is a positive growth factor, and τ is the time constant —the time required for x to increase by one factor of b :
If τ > 0 and b > 1, then x has exponential growth. If τ < 0 and b > 1, or τ > 0 and 0 < b < 1, then x has exponential decay .
Example: If a species of bacteria doubles every ten minutes, starting out with only one bacterium, how many bacteria would be present after one hour? The question implies a = 1, b = 2 and τ = 10 min.
After one hour, or six ten-minute intervals, there would be sixty-four bacteria.
Many pairs ( b , τ ) of a dimensionless non-negative number b and an amount of time τ (a physical quantity which can be expressed as the product of a number of units and a unit of time) represent the same growth rate, with τ proportional to log b . For any fixed b not equal to 1 (e.g. e or 2), the growth rate is given by the non-zero time τ . For any non-zero time τ the growth rate is given by the dimensionless positive number b .
Thus the law of exponential growth can be written in different but mathematically equivalent forms, by using a different base . The most common forms are the following:
where x 0 expresses the initial quantity x (0).
Parameters (negative in the case of exponential decay):
The quantities k , τ, and T , and for a given p also r , have a one-to-one connection given by the following equation (which can be derived by taking the natural logarithm of the above):
where k = 0 corresponds to r = 0 and to τ and T being infinite.
If p is the unit of time the quotient t/p is simply the number of units of time. Using the notation t for the (dimensionless) number of units of time rather than the time itself, t/p can be replaced by t , but for uniformity this has been avoided here. In this case the division by p in the last formula is not a numerical division either, but converts a dimensionless number to the correct quantity including unit.
A popular approximated method for calculating the doubling time from the growth rate is the rule of 70 , i.e. T ≃ 70 / r {\displaystyle T\simeq 70/r} .

Reformulation as log-linear growth
If a variable x exhibits exponential growth according to x ( t ) = x 0 ( 1 + r ) t {\displaystyle x(t)=x_{0}(1+r)^{t}} , then the log (to any base) of x grows linearly over time, as can be seen by taking logarithms of both sides of the exponential growth equation:
This allows an exponentially growing variable to be modeled with a log-linear model . For example, if one wishes to empirically estimate the growth rate from intertemporal data on x , one can linearly regress log x on t .

Differential equation
The exponential function x ( t ) = x ( 0 ) e k t {\displaystyle \scriptstyle x(t)=x(0)e^{kt}} satisfies the linear differential equation :
saying that the growth rate of x at time t is proportional to the value of x ( t ), and it has the initial value
The differential equation is solved by direct integration:
so that
For a nonlinear variation of this growth model see logistic function .

Difference equation
The difference equation
has solution
showing that x experiences exponential growth.

Other growth rates
In the long run, exponential growth of any kind will overtake linear growth of any kind (the basis of the Malthusian catastrophe ) as well as any polynomial growth, i.e., for all α:
There is a whole hierarchy of conceivable growth rates that are slower than exponential and faster than linear (in the long run). See Degree of a polynomial#The degree computed from the function values .
Growth rates may also be faster than exponential. In the most extreme case, when growth increases without bound in finite time, it is called hyperbolic growth . In between exponential and hyperbolic growth lie more classes of growth behavior, like the hyperoperations beginning at tetration , and A ( n , n ) {\displaystyle A(n,n)} , the diagonal of the Ackermann function .
In the above differential equation, if k < 0, then the quantity experiences exponential decay .

Limitations of models
Exponential growth models of physical phenomena only apply within limited regions, as unbounded growth is not physically realistic. Although growth may initially be exponential, the modelled phenomena will eventually enter a region in which previously ignored negative feedback factors become significant (leading to a logistic growth model) or other underlying assumptions of the exponential growth model, such as continuity or instantaneous feedback, break down.

Exponential stories

Rice on a chessboard
According to an old legend, vizier Sissa Ben Dahir presented an Indian King Sharim with a beautiful, hand-made chessboard . The king asked what he would like in return for his gift and the courtier surprised the king by asking for one grain of rice on the first square, two grains on the second, four grains on the third etc. The king readily agreed and asked for the rice to be brought. All went well at first, but the requirement for 2 n − 1 grains on the n th square demanded over a million grains on the 21st square, more than a million million (aka trillion ) on the 41st and there simply was not enough rice in the whole world for the final squares. (From Swirski, 2006) [4]
The second half of the chessboard is the time when an exponentially growing influence is having a significant economic impact on an organization's overall business strategy.

Water lily
French children are told a story in which they imagine having a pond with water lily leaves floating on the surface. The lily population doubles in size every day and if left unchecked will smother the pond in 30 days, killing all the other living things in the water. Day after day the plant seems small and so it is decided to leave it to grow until it half-covers the pond, before cutting it back. They are then asked on what day half-coverage will occur. This is revealed to be the 29th day, and then there will be just one day to save the pond. (From Meadows et al . 1972) [4]

Internet bot
An Internet Bot , also known as web robot , WWW robot or simply bot , is a software application that runs automated tasks (scripts) over the Internet . [1] Typically, bots perform tasks that are both simple and structurally repetitive, at a much higher rate than would be possible for a human alone. The largest use of bots is in web spidering ( web crawler ), in which an automated script fetches, analyzes and files information from web servers at many times the speed of a human. More than half of all web traffic is made up of bots. [2]
Efforts by servers hosting websites to counteract bots vary. Servers may choose to outline rules on the behaviour of internet bots by implementing a robots.txt file: this file is simply text stating the rules governing a bot's behaviour on that server. Any bot interacting with (or 'spidering') any server that does not follow these rules should, in theory, be denied access to, or removed from, the affected website. If the only rule implementation by a server is a posted text file with no associated program/software/app, then adhering to those rules is entirely voluntary – in reality there is no way to enforce those rules, or even to ensure that a bot's creator or implementer acknowledges, or even reads, the robots.txt file contents. Some bots are "good" – i.e. search engine spiders – while others can be used to launch malicious and harsh attacks. [2]

IM and IRC
Some bots communicate with other users of Internet-based services, via instant messaging (IM), Internet Relay Chat (IRC), or another web interface such as Facebook Bots and Twitterbots . These chatterbots may allow people to ask questions in plain English and then formulate a proper response. These bots can often handle many tasks, including reporting weather, zip-code information, sports scores, converting currency or other units, etc. [ citation needed ] Others are used for entertainment, such as SmarterChild on AOL Instant Messenger and MSN Messenger .
An additional role of IRC bots may be to lurk in the background of a conversation channel, commenting on certain phrases uttered by the participants (based on pattern matching ). This is sometimes used as a help service for new users, or for censorship of profanity .

Marketing bots
More and more marketing companies are using bots on social media websites. They send automatic follows, likes and comments on profiles and posts that use tags of their niche. This way they get attention from real users who are curious about the profile who they get notifications from. The two most popular social media marketing bots are Instagress and MonsterSocial . MonsterSocial supports Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, Tumblr and Twitter. Instagress has been the most popular Instagram bot for a long time, but it was shut down in May 2017 because of a location check when logging in on Instagram.

Commercial purposes
There has been a great deal of controversy about the use of bots in an automated trading function. Auction website eBay has been to court in an attempt to suppress a third-party company from using bots to traverse their site looking for bargains; this approach backfired on eBay and attracted the attention of further bots. The United Kingdom -based bet exchange Betfair saw such a large amount of traffic coming from bots they launched a WebService API aimed at bot programmers through which Betfair can actively manage bot interactions.
Bot farms are known to be used in online app stores, like the Apple App Store and Google Play , to manipulate positions [3] or to increase positive ratings/reviews. [4]

Malicious purposes
Another, more malicious use of bots is the coordination and operation of an automated attack on networked computers, such as a denial-of-service attack by a botnet . Internet bots can also be used to commit click fraud and more recently have seen usage around MMORPG games as computer game bots . [ citation needed ] A spambot is an internet bot that attempts to spam large amounts of content on the Internet, usually adding advertising links. More than 94.2% of websites have experienced a bot attack. [2]
The most widely used anti-bot technique is the use of CAPTCHA , which is a form of Turing test used to distinguish between a human user and a less-sophisticated AI-powered bot, by the use of graphically encoded human-readable text. Examples of providers include Recaptcha , and commercial companies such as Minteye, Solve Media , and NuCaptcha . Captchas, however, are not foolproof in preventing bots as they can often be circumvented by computer character recognition, security holes, and even by outsourcing captcha solving to cheap laborers.

Linux
Linux (pronounced i / ˈ l ɪ n ə k s / LIN -əks [9] [10] or, less frequently, / ˈ l aɪ n ə k s / LYN -əks [10] [11] ) is a Unix-like computer operating system assembled under the model of free and open-source software development and distribution. The defining component of Linux is the Linux kernel , [12] an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991 by Linus Torvalds . [13] [14] [15] The Free Software Foundation uses the name GNU /Linux to describe the operating system, which has led to some controversy . [16] [17]
Linux was originally developed for personal computers based on the Intel x86 architecture, but has since been ported to more platforms than any other operating system. [18] Because of the dominance of Android on smartphones , Linux has the largest installed base of all general-purpose operating systems . [19] Linux is also the leading operating system on servers and other big iron systems such as mainframe computers , and is used on 99.6% of the TOP500 supercomputers . [20] [21] It is used by around 2.3% of desktop computers . [22] [23] The Chromebook , which runs the Linux kernel-based Chrome OS , dominates the US K–12 education market and represents nearly 20% of the sub-$300 notebook sales in the US. [24] Linux also runs on embedded systems – devices whose operating system is typically built into the firmware and is highly tailored to the system. This includes TiVo and similar DVR devices, network routers , facility automation controls, televisions, [25] [26] video game consoles and smartwatches . [27] Many smartphones and tablet computers run Android and other Linux derivatives. [28]
The development of Linux is one of the most prominent examples of free and open-source software collaboration. The underlying source code may be used, modified and distributed‍—‌commercially or non-commercially‍—‌by anyone under the terms of its respective licenses, such as the GNU General Public License . Typically, Linux is packaged in a form known as a Linux distribution (or distro for short) for both desktop and server use. Some of the most popular mainstream Linux distributions [29] [30] [31] are Arch Linux , CentOS , Debian , Fedora , Gentoo Linux , Linux Mint , Mageia , openSUSE and Ubuntu , together with commercial distributions such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server . Distributions include the Linux kernel, supporting utilities and libraries , many of which are provided by the GNU Project , and usually a large amount of application software to fulfil the distribution's intended use.
Desktop Linux distributions include a windowing system, such as X11 , Mir or a Wayland implementation, and an accompanying desktop environment such as GNOME or the KDE Software Compilation ; some distributions may also include a less resource-intensive desktop, such as LXDE or Xfce . Distributions intended to run on servers may omit all graphical environments from the standard install, and instead include other software to set up and operate a solution stack such as LAMP . Because Linux is freely redistributable, anyone may create a distribution for any intended use.

History

Antecedents
The Unix operating system was conceived and implemented in 1969 at AT&T 's Bell Laboratories in the United States by Ken Thompson , Dennis Ritchie , Douglas McIlroy , and Joe Ossanna . [32] First released in 1971, Unix was written entirely in assembly language , as was common practice at the time. Later, in a key pioneering approach in 1973, it was rewritten in the C programming language by Dennis Ritchie (with exceptions to the kernel and I/O). The availability of a high-level language implementation of Unix made its porting to different computer platforms easier.
Due to an earlier antitrust case forbidding it from entering the computer business, AT&T was required to license the operating system's source code to anyone who asked. [33] As a result, Unix grew quickly and became widely adopted by academic institutions and businesses. In 1984, AT&T divested itself of Bell Labs; freed of the legal obligation requiring free licensing, Bell Labs began selling Unix as a proprietary product.
The GNU Project , started in 1983 by Richard Stallman , has the goal of creating a "complete Unix-compatible software system" composed entirely of free software . Work began in 1984. [34] Later, in 1985, Stallman started the Free Software Foundation and wrote the GNU General Public License (GNU GPL) in 1989. By the early 1990s, many of the programs required in an operating system (such as libraries, compilers , text editors , a Unix shell , and a windowing system ) were completed, although low-level elements such as device drivers , daemons , and the kernel were stalled and incomplete. [35] [ not in citation given ]
Linus Torvalds has stated that if the GNU kernel had been available at the time (1991), he would not have decided to write his own. [36]
Although not released until 1992 due to legal complications , development of 386BSD , from which NetBSD , OpenBSD and FreeBSD descended, predated that of Linux. Torvalds has also stated that if 386BSD had been available at the time, he probably would not have created Linux. [37]
MINIX was created by Andrew S. Tanenbaum , a computer science professor, and released in 1987 as a minimal Unix-like operating system targeted at students and others who wanted to learn the operating system principles. Although the complete source code of MINIX was freely available, the licensing terms prevented it from being free software until the licensing changed in April 2000. [38]

Creation
In 1991, while attending the University of Helsinki , Torvalds became curious about operating systems [39] and frustrated by the licensing of MINIX, which at the time limited it to educational use only. [38] He began to work on his own operating system kernel, which eventually became the Linux kernel .
Torvalds began the development of the Linux kernel on MINIX and applications written for MINIX were also used on Linux. Later, Linux matured and further Linux kernel development took place on Linux systems. [40] GNU applications also replaced all MINIX components, because it was advantageous to use the freely available code from the GNU Project with the fledgling operating system; code licensed under the GNU GPL can be reused in other computer programs as long as they also are released under the same or a compatible license. Torvalds initiated a switch from his original license, which prohibited commercial redistribution, to the GNU GPL. [41] Developers worked to integrate GNU components with the Linux kernel, making a fully functional and free operating system. [35]

Naming
Linus Torvalds had wanted to call his invention " Freax ", a portmanteau of "free", "freak", and "x" (as an allusion to Unix). During the start of his work on the system, some of the project's makefiles included the name "Freax" for about half a year. Torvalds had already considered the name "Linux", but initially dismissed it as too egotistical. [42]
In order to facilitate development, the files were uploaded to the FTP server (ftp.funet.fi) of FUNET in September 1991. Ari Lemmke , Torvalds' coworker at the Helsinki University of Technology (HUT), who was one of the volunteer administrators for the FTP server at the time, did not think that "Freax" was a good name. So, he named the project "Linux" on the server without consulting Torvalds. [42] Later, however, Torvalds consented to "Linux".
To demonstrate how the word "Linux" should be pronounced ( i / ˈ l ɪ n ə k s / LIN -əks [9] [10] ), Torvalds included an audio guide ( listen ( help · info ) ) with the kernel source code. [43] Another variant of pronunciation is / ˈ l aɪ n ə k s / LYN -əks . [10] [11]

Commercial and popular uptake
Adoption of Linux in production environments, rather than being used only by hobbyists, started to take off first in the mid-1990s in the supercomputing community, where organizations such as NASA started to replace their increasingly expensive machines with clusters of inexpensive commodity computers running Linux. Commercial use followed when Dell and IBM , followed by Hewlett-Packard , started offering Linux support to escape Microsoft 's monopoly in the desktop operating system market. [44]
Today, Linux systems are used throughout computing, from embedded systems to supercomputers , [21] [45] and have secured a place in server installations such as the popular LAMP application stack. [46] Use of Linux distributions in home and enterprise desktops has been growing. [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] Linux distributions have also become popular in the netbook market, with many devices shipping with customized Linux distributions installed, and Google releasing their own Chrome OS designed for netbooks.
Linux's greatest success in the consumer market is perhaps the mobile device market, with Android being one of the most dominant operating systems on smartphones and very popular on tablets and, more recently, on wearables . Linux gaming is also on the rise with Valve showing its support for Linux and rolling out its own gaming oriented Linux distribution. Linux distributions have also gained popularity with various local and national governments, such as the federal government of Brazil . [54]

Current development
Torvalds continues to direct the development of the kernel. [55] Stallman heads the Free Software Foundation, [56] which in turn supports the GNU components. [57] Finally, individuals and corporations develop third-party non-GNU components. These third-party components comprise a vast body of work and may include both kernel modules and user applications and libraries.
Linux vendors and communities combine and distribute the kernel, GNU components, and non-GNU components, with additional package management software in the form of Linux distributions .

Design
A Linux-based system is a modular Unix-like operating system, deriving much of its basic design from principles established in Unix during the 1970s and 1980s. Such a system uses a monolithic kernel , the Linux kernel , which handles process control, networking, access to the peripherals , and file systems . Device drivers are either integrated directly with the kernel, or added as modules that are loaded while the system is running. [58]
Separate projects that interface with the kernel provide much of the system's higher-level functionality. The GNU userland is an important part of most Linux-based systems, providing the most common implementation of the C library , a popular CLI shell , and many of the common Unix tools which carry out many basic operating system tasks. The graphical user interface (or GUI) used by most Linux systems is built on top of an implementation of the X Window System . [59] More recently, the Linux community seeks to advance to Wayland as the new display server protocol in place of X11 ; Ubuntu, however, develops Mir instead of Wayland. [60]
Installed components of a Linux system include the following: [59] [61]

User interface
The user interface , also known as the shell , is either a command-line interface (CLI), a graphical user interface (GUI), or through controls attached to the associated hardware, which is common for embedded systems . For desktop systems, the default mode is usually a graphical user interface, although the CLI is available through terminal emulator windows or on a separate virtual console .
CLI shells are text-based user interfaces, which use text for both input and output. The dominant shell used in Linux is the Bourne-Again Shell (bash), originally developed for the GNU project . Most low-level Linux components, including various parts of the userland , use the CLI exclusively. The CLI is particularly suited for automation of repetitive or delayed tasks, and provides very simple inter-process communication .
On desktop systems, the most popular user interfaces are the GUI shells , packaged together with extensive desktop environments , such as the K Desktop Environment (KDE) , GNOME , MATE , Cinnamon , Unity , LXDE , Pantheon and Xfce , though a variety of additional user interfaces exist. Most popular user interfaces are based on the X Window System , often simply called "X". It provides network transparency and permits a graphical application running on one system to be displayed on another where a user may interact with the application; however, certain extensions of the X Window System are not capable of working over the network. [62] Several X display servers exist, with the reference implementation, X.Org Server , being the most popular.
Several types of window managers exist for X11, including tiling , dynamic , stacking and compositing . Window managers provide means to control the placement and appearance of individual application windows, and interact with the X Window System. Simpler X window managers such as dwm or ratpoison provide a minimalist functionality, while more elaborate window managers such as FVWM , Enlightenment or Window Maker provide more features such as a built-in taskbar and themes , but are still lightweight when compared to desktop environments. Desktop environments include window managers as part of their standard installations, such as Mutter (GNOME), KWin (KDE) or Xfwm (xfce), although users may choose to use a different window manager if preferred.
Wayland is a display server protocol intended as a replacement for the X11 protocol; as of 2014 [update] , it has not received wider adoption. Unlike X11, Wayland does not need an external window manager and compositing manager. Therefore, a Wayland compositor takes the role of the display server, window manager and compositing manager. Weston is the reference implementation of Wayland, while GNOME's Mutter and KDE's KWin are being ported to Wayland as standalone display servers. Enlightenment has already been successfully ported since version 19.

Video input infrastructure
Linux currently has two modern kernel-userspace APIs for handing video input devices: V4L2 API for video streams and radio, and DVB API for digital TV reception. [63]
Due to the complexity and diversity of different devices, and due to the large amount of formats and standards handled by those APIs, this infrastructure needs to evolve to better fit other devices. Also, a good userspace device library is the key of the success for having userspace applications to be able to work with all formats supported by those devices. [64] [65]

Development
The primary difference between Linux and many other popular contemporary operating systems is that the Linux kernel and other components are free and open-source software . Linux is not the only such operating system, although it is by far the most widely used. [66] Some free and open-source software licenses are based on the principle of copyleft , a kind of reciprocity: any work derived from a copyleft piece of software must also be copyleft itself. The most common free software license, the GNU General Public License (GPL), is a form of copyleft, and is used for the Linux kernel and many of the components from the GNU Project .
Linux based distributions are intended by developers for interoperability with other operating systems and established computing standards. Linux systems adhere to POSIX , [67] SUS , [68] LSB , ISO , and ANSI standards where possible, although to date only one Linux distribution has been POSIX.1 certified, Linux-FT. [69] [70]
Free software projects, although developed through collaboration , are often produced independently of each other. The fact that the software licenses explicitly permit redistribution, however, provides a basis for larger scale projects that collect the software produced by stand-alone projects and make it available all at once in the form of a Linux distribution.
Many Linux distributions, or "distros", manage a remote collection of system software and application software packages available for download and installation through a network connection. This allows users to adapt the operating system to their specific needs. Distributions are maintained by individuals, loose-knit teams, volunteer organizations, and commercial entities. A distribution is responsible for the default configuration of the installed Linux kernel, general system security, and more generally integration of the different software packages into a coherent whole. Distributions typically use a package manager such as apt , yum , zypper , pacman or portage to install, remove, and update all of a system's software from one central location.

Community
A distribution is largely driven by its developer and user communities. Some vendors develop and fund their distributions on a volunteer basis, Debian being a well-known example. Others maintain a community version of their commercial distributions, as Red Hat does with Fedora , and SUSE does with openSUSE .
In many cities and regions, local associations known as Linux User Groups (LUGs) seek to promote their preferred distribution and by extension free software. They hold meetings and provide free demonstrations, training, technical support, and operating system installation to new users. Many Internet communities also provide support to Linux users and developers. Most distributions and free software / open-source projects have IRC chatrooms or newsgroups . Online forums are another means for support, with notable examples being LinuxQuestions.org and the various distribution specific support and community forums, such as ones for Ubuntu , Fedora , and Gentoo . Linux distributions host mailing lists ; commonly there will be a specific topic such as usage or development for a given list.
There are several technology websites with a Linux focus. Print magazines on Linux often bundle cover disks that carry software or even complete Linux distributions. [71] [72]
Although Linux distributions are generally available without charge, several large corporations sell, support, and contribute to the development of the components of the system and of free software . An analysis of the Linux kernel showed 75 percent of the code from December 2008 to January 2010 was developed by programmers working for corporations, leaving about 18 percent to volunteers and 7% unclassified. [73] Major corporations that provide contributions include Dell , IBM , HP , Oracle , Sun Microsystems (now part of Oracle) and Nokia . A number of corporations, notably Red Hat, Canonical and SUSE , have built a significant business around Linux distributions.
The free software licenses , on which the various software packages of a distribution built on the Linux kernel are based, explicitly accommodate and encourage commercialization; the relationship between a Linux distribution as a whole and individual vendors may be seen as symbiotic . One common business model of commercial suppliers is charging for support, especially for business users. A number of companies also offer a specialized business version of their distribution, which adds proprietary support packages and tools to administer higher numbers of installations or to simplify administrative tasks.
Another business model is to give away the software in order to sell hardware. This used to be the norm in the computer industry, with operating systems such as CP/M , Apple DOS and versions of Mac OS prior to 7.6 freely copyable (but not modifiable). As computer hardware standardized throughout the 1980s, it became more difficult for hardware manufacturers to profit from this tactic, as the OS would run on any manufacturer's computer that shared the same architecture.

Programming on Linux
Linux distributions support dozens of programming languages . The original development tools used for building both Linux applications and operating system programs are found within the GNU toolchain , which includes the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) and the GNU Build System . Amongst others, GCC provides compilers for Ada , C , C++ , Go and Fortran . Many programming languages have a cross-platform reference implementation that supports Linux, for example PHP , Perl , Ruby , Python , Java , Go, Rust and Haskell . First released in 2003, the LLVM project provides an alternative cross-platform open-source compiler for many languages. Proprietary compilers for Linux include the Intel C++ Compiler , Sun Studio , and IBM XL C / C++ Compiler. BASIC in the form of Visual Basic is supported in such forms as Gambas , FreeBASIC , and XBasic , and in terms of terminal programming or QuickBASIC or Turbo BASIC programming in the form of QB64 .
A common feature of Unix-like systems, Linux includes traditional specific-purpose programming languages targeted at scripting , text processing and system configuration and management in general. Linux distributions support shell scripts , awk , sed and make . Many programs also have an embedded programming language to support configuring or programming themselves. For example, regular expressions are supported in programs like grep and locate , the traditional Unix MTA Sendmail contains its own Turing complete scripting system, and the advanced text editor GNU Emacs is built around a general purpose Lisp interpreter.
Most distributions also include support for PHP , Perl , Ruby , Python and other dynamic languages . While not as common, Linux also supports C# (via Mono ), Vala , and Scheme . Guile Scheme acts as an extension language targeting the GNU system utilities, seeking to make the conventionally small, static , compiled C programs of Unix design rapidly and dynamically extensible via an elegant, functional high-level scripting system; many GNU programs can be compiled with optional Guile bindings to this end. A number of Java Virtual Machines and development kits run on Linux, including the original Sun Microsystems JVM ( HotSpot ), and IBM's J2SE RE, as well as many open-source projects like Kaffe and JikesRVM .
GNOME and KDE are popular desktop environments and provide a framework for developing applications. These projects are based on the GTK+ and Qt widget toolkits , respectively, which can also be used independently of the larger framework. Both support a wide variety of languages. There are a number of Integrated development environments available including Anjuta , Code::Blocks , CodeLite , Eclipse , Geany , ActiveState Komodo , KDevelop , Lazarus , MonoDevelop , NetBeans , and Qt Creator , while the long-established editors Vim , nano and Emacs remain popular. [74]

Hardware support
The Linux kernel is a widely ported operating system kernel, available for devices ranging from mobile phones to supercomputers; it runs on a highly diverse range of computer architectures , including the hand-held ARM -based iPAQ and the IBM mainframes System z9 or System z10 . [75] Specialized distributions and kernel forks exist for less mainstream architectures; for example, the ELKS kernel fork can run on Intel 8086 or Intel 80286 16-bit microprocessors, while the µClinux kernel fork may run on systems without a memory management unit . The kernel also runs on architectures that were only ever intended to use a manufacturer-created operating system, such as Macintosh computers (with both PowerPC and Intel processors), PDAs , video game consoles , portable music players , and mobile phones.
There are several industry associations and hardware conferences devoted to maintaining and improving support for diverse hardware under Linux, such as FreedomHEC . Over time, support for different hardware has improved in Linux, resulting in any off-the-shelf purchase having a "good chance" of being compatible. [76]

Uses
Beside the Linux distributions designed for general-purpose use on desktops and servers, distributions may be specialized for different purposes including: computer architecture support, embedded systems , stability, security, localization to a specific region or language, targeting of specific user groups, support for real-time applications, or commitment to a given desktop environment. Furthermore, some distributions deliberately include only free software . As of 2015 [update] , over four hundred Linux distributions are actively developed, with about a dozen distributions being most popular for general-purpose use. [77]

Desktop
The popularity of Linux on standard desktop computers and laptops has been increasing over the years. [78] Most modern distributions include a graphical user environment, with, as of February 2015 [update] , the two most popular environments being the KDE Plasma Desktop and Xfce . [79]
No single official Linux desktop exists: rather desktop environments and Linux distributions select components from a pool of free and open-source software with which they construct a GUI implementing some more or less strict design guide. GNOME, for example, has its human interface guidelines as a design guide, which gives the human–machine interface an important role, not just when doing the graphical design, but also when considering people with disabilities , and even when focusing on security. [80]
The collaborative nature of free software development allows distributed teams to perform language localization of some Linux distributions for use in locales where localizing proprietary systems would not be cost-effective. For example, the Sinhalese language version of the Knoppix distribution became available significantly before Microsoft translated Windows XP into Sinhalese. [81] In this case the Lanka Linux User Group played a major part in developing the localized system by combining the knowledge of university professors, linguists , and local developers.

Performance and applications
The performance of Linux on the desktop has been a controversial topic; [ citation needed ] for example in 2007 Con Kolivas accused the Linux community of favoring performance on servers. He quit Linux kernel development out of frustration with this lack of focus on the desktop, and then gave a "tell all" interview on the topic. [82] Since then a significant amount of development has focused on improving the desktop experience. Projects such as Upstart and systemd aim for a faster boot time; the Wayland and Mir projects aim at replacing X11 while enhancing desktop performance, security and appearance. [83]
Many popular applications are available for a wide variety of operating systems. For example, Mozilla Firefox , OpenOffice.org / LibreOffice and Blender have downloadable versions for all major operating systems. Furthermore, some applications initially developed for Linux, such as Pidgin , and GIMP , were ported to other operating systems (including Windows and Mac OS X ) due to their popularity. In addition, a growing number of proprietary desktop applications are also supported on Linux, [84] such as Autodesk Maya , Softimage XSI and Apple Shake in the high-end field of animation and visual effects; see the list of proprietary software for Linux for more details. There are also several companies that have ported their own or other companies' games to Linux, with Linux also being a supported platform on both the popular Steam and Desura digital-distribution services. [85]
Many other types of applications available for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X also run on Linux. Commonly, either a free software application will exist which does the functions of an application found on another operating system, or that application will have a version that works on Linux, such as with Skype and some video games like Dota 2 and Team Fortress 2 . Furthermore, the Wine project provides a Windows compatibility layer to run unmodified Windows applications on Linux. It is sponsored by commercial interests including CodeWeavers , which produces a commercial version of the software. Since 2009, Google has also provided funding to the Wine project. [86] [87] CrossOver , a proprietary solution based on the open-source Wine project, supports running Windows versions of Microsoft Office , Intuit applications such as Quicken and QuickBooks , Adobe Photoshop versions through CS2, and many popular games such as World of Warcraft . In other cases, where there is no Linux port of some software in areas such as desktop publishing [88] and professional audio , [89] [90] [91] there is equivalent software available on Linux. It is also possible to run applications written for Android on other versions of Linux using Anbox . [92]

Components and installation
Besides externally visible components, such as X window managers , a non-obvious but quite central role is played by the programs hosted by freedesktop.org , such as D-Bus or PulseAudio ; both major desktop environments (GNOME and KDE) include them, each offering graphical front-ends written using the corresponding toolkit ( GTK+ or Qt ). A display server is another component, which for the longest time has been communicating in the X11 display server protocol with its clients; prominent software talking X11 includes the X.Org Server and Xlib . Frustration over the cumbersome X11 core protocol, and especially over its numerous extensions, has led to the creation of a new display server protocol, Wayland .
Installing, updating and removing software in Linux is typically done through the use of package managers such as the Synaptic Package Manager , PackageKit , and Yum Extender . While most major Linux distributions have extensive repositories, often containing tens of thousands of packages, not all the software that can run on Linux is available from the official repositories. Alternatively, users can install packages from unofficial repositories, download pre-compiled packages directly from websites, or compile the source code by themselves. All these methods come with different degrees of difficulty; compiling the source code is in general considered a challenging process for new Linux users, but it is hardly needed in modern distributions and is not a method specific to Linux.

Netbooks
Linux distributions have also become popular in the netbook market, with many devices such as the Asus Eee PC and Acer Aspire One shipping with customized Linux distributions installed. [93]
In 2009, Google announced its Chrome OS as a minimal Linux-based operating system, using the Chrome browser as the main user interface. Chrome OS does not run any non-web applications, except for the bundled file manager and media player (a certain level of support for Android applications was added in later versions). [94] The netbooks that shipped with the operating system, termed Chromebooks , started appearing on the market in June 2011. [95]

Servers, mainframes and supercomputers
Linux distributions have long been used as server operating systems, and have risen to prominence in that area; Netcraft reported in September 2006, that eight of the ten most reliable internet hosting companies ran Linux distributions on their web servers . [96] In June 2008, Linux distributions represented five of the top ten, FreeBSD three of ten, and Microsoft two of ten; [97] since February 2010, Linux distributions represented six of the top ten, FreeBSD two of ten, and Microsoft one of ten. [98]
Linux distributions are the cornerstone of the LAMP server-software combination (Linux, Apache , MariaDB / MySQL , Perl / PHP / Python ) which has achieved popularity among developers, and which is one of the more common platforms for website hosting. [99]
Linux distributions have become increasingly popular on mainframes , partly due to pricing and the open-source model. [100] In December 2009, computer giant IBM reported that it would predominantly market and sell mainframe-based Enterprise Linux Server. [101] At LinuxCon North America 2015 , IBM announced LinuxONE , a series of mainframes specifically designed to run Linux and open-source software. [102] [103]
Linux distributions are also most commonly used as operating systems for supercomputers; [21] in the decade since the Earth Simulator supercomputer, all the fastest supercomputers have used Linux. As of November 2016 [update] , 99.6% of the world's 500 fastest supercomputers run some variant of Linux, [104] (the only exceptions, are ranked 386th and 387th and they run AIX Unix). [105] Linux is also dominant on the Green500 list.

Smart devices
Several operating systems for smart devices , such as smartphones , tablet computers , smart TVs , and in-vehicle infotainment (IVI) systems, are based on Linux. Major platforms for such systems include Android , Firefox OS , Mer and Tizen .
Android has become the dominant mobile operating system for smartphones , running on 79.3% of units sold worldwide during the second quarter of 2013. [106] Android is also a popular operating system for tablets, and Android smart TVs and in-vehicle infotainment systems have also appeared in the market.
Cellphones and PDAs running Linux on open-source platforms became more common from 2007; examples include the Nokia N810 , Openmoko 's Neo1973 , and the Motorola ROKR E8 . Continuing the trend, Palm (later acquired by HP ) produced a new Linux-derived operating system, webOS , which is built into its line of Palm Pre smartphones.
Nokia 's Maemo , one of the earliest mobile operating systems, was based on Debian . [107] It was later merged with Intel 's Moblin , another Linux-based operating system, to form MeeGo . [108] The project was later terminated in favor of Tizen, an operating system targeted at mobile devices as well as IVI. Tizen is a project within The Linux Foundation . Several Samsung products are already running Tizen, Samsung Gear 2 being the most significant example. [109] Samsung Z smartphones will use Tizen instead of Android. [110]
As a result of MeeGo's termination, the Mer project forked the MeeGo codebase to create a basis for mobile-oriented operating systems. [111] In July 2012, Jolla announced Sailfish OS , their own mobile operating system built upon Mer technology.
Mozilla's Firefox OS consists of the Linux kernel, a hardware abstraction layer , a web-standards -based runtime environment and user interface, and an integrated web browser . [112]
Canonical has released Ubuntu Touch , aiming to bring convergence to the user experience on this mobile operating system and its desktop counterpart, Ubuntu . The operating system also provides a full Ubuntu desktop when connected to an external monitor. [113]

Embedded devices
Due to its low cost and ease of customization, Linux is often used in embedded systems . In the non-mobile telecommunications equipment sector, the majority of customer-premises equipment (CPE) hardware runs some Linux-based operating system. OpenWrt is a community driven example upon which many of the OEM firmwares are based.
For example, the popular TiVo digital video recorder also uses a customized Linux, [115] as do several network firewalls and routers from such makers as Cisco / Linksys . The Korg OASYS , the Korg KRONOS , the Yamaha Motif XS /Motif XF music workstations , [116] Yamaha S90XS/S70XS, Yamaha MOX6/MOX8 synthesizers, Yamaha Motif-Rack XS tone generator module , and Roland RD-700GX digital piano also run Linux. Linux is also used in stage lighting control systems, such as the WholeHogIII console. [117]

Gaming
In the past, not many games were available for Linux, but in the recent years, more games have been released with support for Linux. Nowadays, many games support Linux (especially Indie games ), except for a few AAA title games. On the other hand, as a popular mobile platform, Android (which uses the Linux kernel ) has gained much developer interest and is one of the main platforms for mobile game development along with iOS operating system by Apple for iPhone and iPad devices.
On February 14, 2013, Valve released a Linux version of Steam , a popular game distribution platform on PC. [118] Many Steam games were ported to Linux. [119] On December 13, 2013, Valve released SteamOS , a gaming oriented OS based on Debian, for beta testing , and has plans to ship Steam Machines as a gaming and entertainment platform. [120] Valve has also developed VOGL , an OpenGL debugger intended to aid video game development, [121] as well as porting its Source game engine to desktop Linux. [122] As a result of Valve's effort, several prominent games such as DotA 2 , Team Fortress 2 , Portal , Portal 2 and Left 4 Dead 2 are now natively available on desktop Linux.
On July 31, 2013, Nvidia released Shield as an attempt to use Android as a specialized gaming platform. [123]
Some Linux users play Windows games through Wine or CrossOver Linux .

Specialized uses
Due to the flexibility, customizability and free and open-source nature of Linux, it becomes possible to highly tune Linux for a specific purpose. There are two main methods for creating a specialized Linux distribution: building from scratch or from a general-purpose distribution as a base. The distributions often used for this purpose include Debian , Fedora , Ubuntu (which is itself based on Debian), Arch Linux , Gentoo , and Slackware . In contrast, Linux distributions built from scratch do not have general-purpose bases; instead, they focus on the JeOS philosophy by including only necessary components and avoiding resource overhead caused by components considered redundant in the distribution's use cases.

Home theater PC
A home theater PC (HTPC) is a PC that is mainly used as an entertainment system, especially a Home theater system . It is normally connected to a television, and often an additional audio system.
OpenELEC , a Linux distribution that incorporates the media center software Kodi , is an OS tuned specifically for an HTPC. Having been built from the ground up adhering to the JeOS principle, the OS is very lightweight and very suitable for the confined usage range of an HTPC.
There are also special editions of Linux distributions that include the MythTV media center software, such as Mythbuntu , a special edition of Ubuntu.

Digital security
Kali Linux is a Debian-based Linux distribution designed for digital forensics and penetration testing . It comes preinstalled with several software applications for penetration testing and identifying security exploits . [124] The Ubuntu derivative BackBox provides pre-installed security and network analysis tools for ethical hacking.
There are many Linux distributions created with privacy, secrecy, network anonymity and information security in mind, including Tails , Tin Hat Linux and Tinfoil Hat Linux . Lightweight Portable Security is a distribution based on Arch Linux and developed by the United States Department of Defense . Tor-ramdisk is a minimal distribution created solely to host the network anonymity software Tor .

System rescue
Linux Live CD sessions have long been used as a tool for recovering data from a broken computer system and for repairing the system. Building upon that idea, several Linux distributions tailored for this purpose have emerged, most of which use GParted as a partition editor, with additional data recovery and system repair software:

In space
SpaceX uses multiple redundant flight computers in a fault-tolerant design in the Falcon 9 rocket. Each Merlin engine is controlled by three voting computers, with two physical processors per computer that constantly check each other's operation. Linux is not inherently fault-tolerant (no operating system is, as it is a function of the whole system including the hardware), but the flight computer software makes it so for its purpose. [125] For flexibility, commercial off-the-shelf parts and system-wide "radiation-tolerant" design are used instead of radiation hardened parts. [125] As of June 2015 [update] , SpaceX has made 19 launches of the Falcon 9 since 2010, out of which 18 have successfully delivered their primary payloads to Earth orbit , including some support missions for the International Space Station .
In addition, Windows was used as an operating system on non-mission critical systems‍—‌laptops used on board the space station, for example‍—‌but it has been replaced with Linux; the first Linux-powered humanoid robot is also undergoing in-flight testing. [126]
The Jet Propulsion Laboratory has used Linux for a number of years "to help with projects relating to the construction of unmanned space flight and deep space exploration"; NASA uses Linux in robotics in the Mars rover, and Ubuntu Linux to "save data from satellites". [127]

Education
Linux distributions have been created to provide hands-on experience with coding and source code to students, on devices such as the Raspberry Pi . In addition to producing a practical device, the intention is to show students "how things work under the hood".
The Ubuntu derivatives Edubuntu and The Linux Schools Project , as well as the Debian derivative Skolelinux , provide education-oriented software packages. They also include tools for administering and building school computer labs and computer-based classrooms, such as the Linux Terminal Server Project (LTSP).

Others
Instant WebKiosk and Webconverger are browser-based Linux distributions often used in web kiosks and digital signage . Thinstation is a minimalist distribution designed for thin clients . Rocks Cluster Distribution is tailored for high-performance computing clusters .
There are general-purpose Linux distributions that target a specific audience, such as users of a specific language or geographical area. Such examples include Ubuntu Kylin for Chinese language users and BlankOn targeted at Indonesians. Profession-specific distributions include Ubuntu Studio for media creation and DNALinux for bioinformatics . There is also a Muslim-oriented distribution of the name Sabily , as well as an Arabic-focused distribution called Ojuba Linux that consequently also provides some Islamic tools. Certain organizations use slightly specialized Linux distributions internally, including GendBuntu used by the French National Gendarmerie , Goobuntu used internally by Google, and Astra Linux developed specifically for the Russian army.

Market share and uptake
Many quantitative studies of free /open-source software focus on topics including market share and reliability, with numerous studies specifically examining Linux. [128] The Linux market is growing rapidly, and the revenue of servers, desktops, and packaged software running Linux was expected to [ needs update ] exceed $35.7 billion by 2008. [129] Analysts and proponents attribute the relative success of Linux to its security, reliability, low cost, and freedom from vendor lock-in . [130] [131]

Copyright, trademark, and naming
Linux kernel is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL), version 2. The GPL requires that anyone who distributes software based on source code under this license, must make the originating source code (and any modifications) available to the recipient under the same terms. [154] Other key components of a typical Linux distribution are also mainly licensed under the GPL, but they may use other licenses; many libraries use the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL), a more permissive variant of the GPL, and the X.org implementation of the X Window System uses the MIT License .
Torvalds states that the Linux kernel will not move from version 2 of the GPL to version 3. [155] [156] He specifically dislikes some provisions in the new license which prohibit the use of the software in digital rights management . [157] It would also be impractical to obtain permission from all the copyright holders, who number in the thousands. [158]
A 2001 study of Red Hat Linux 7.1 found that this distribution contained 30 million source lines of code . [159] Using the Constructive Cost Model , the study estimated that this distribution required about eight thousand man-years of development time. According to the study, if all this software had been developed by conventional proprietary means, it would have cost about $1.5 billion (2017 US dollars) to develop in the United States. [159] Most of the source code (71%) was written in the C programming language , but many other languages were used, including C++ , Lisp , assembly language , Perl , Python , Fortran , and various shell scripting languages. Slightly over half of all lines of code were licensed under the GPL. The Linux kernel itself was 2.4 million lines of code, or 8% of the total. [159]
In a later study, the same analysis was performed for Debian version 4.0 (etch, which was released in 2007). [160] This distribution contained close to 283 million source lines of code, and the study estimated that it would have required about seventy three thousand man-years and cost US$8.28 billion (in 2017 dollars) to develop by conventional means.
In the United States, the name Linux is a trademark registered to Linus Torvalds. [8] Initially, nobody registered it, but on August 15, 1994, William R. Della Croce, Jr. filed for the trademark Linux , and then demanded royalties from Linux distributors. In 1996, Torvalds and some affected organizations sued him to have the trademark assigned to Torvalds, and, in 1997, the case was settled. [162] The licensing of the trademark has since been handled by the Linux Mark Institute (LMI). Torvalds has stated that he trademarked the name only to prevent someone else from using it. LMI originally charged a nominal sublicensing fee for use of the Linux name as part of trademarks, [163] but later changed this in favor of offering a free, perpetual worldwide sublicense. [164]
The Free Software Foundation (FSF) prefers GNU/Linux as the name when referring to the operating system as a whole, because it considers Linux distributions to be variants of the GNU operating system initiated in 1983 by Richard Stallman , president of the FSF. [16] [17] They explicitly take no issue over the name Android for the Android OS, which is also an operating system based on the Linux kernel, as GNU is not a part of it. However, they object to it on grounds of including proprietary components. The FSF holds this stance for any operating system with proprietary components, including Linux operating systems such as Red Hat Linux . [ citation needed ]
A minority of public figures and software projects other than Stallman and the FSF, notably Debian (which had been sponsored by the FSF up to 1996), [165] also use GNU/Linux when referring to the operating system as a whole. [115] [166] [167] Most media and common usage, however, refers to this family of operating systems simply as Linux , as do many large Linux distributions (for example, SUSE Linux and Red Hat Enterprise Linux ). In contrast Linux distributions containing only free software use "GNU/Linux" or simply "GNU", such as Trisquel GNU/Linux , Parabola GNU/Linux-libre , BLAG Linux and GNU , and gNewSense .
As of May 2011 [update] , about 8% to 13% of a modern Linux distribution is made of GNU components (the range depending on whether GNOME is considered part of GNU), as determined by counting lines of source code making up Ubuntu's "Natty" release; meanwhile, 6% is taken by the Linux kernel, and 9% by the Linux kernel and its direct dependencies. [168]

Industrial organization
In economics , industrial organization or Industrial economy is a field that builds on the theory of the firm by examining the structure of (and, therefore, the boundaries between) firms and markets . Industrial organization adds real-world complications to the perfectly competitive model, complications such as transaction costs , [1] limited information , and barriers to entry of new firms that may be associated with imperfect competition . It analyzes determinants of firm and market organization and behavior as between competition [2] and monopoly , [3] including from government actions.
There are different approaches to the subject. One approach is descriptive in providing an overview of industrial organization, such as measures of competition and the size- concentration of firms in an industry. A second approach uses microeconomic models to explain internal firm organization and market strategy, which includes internal research and development along with issues of internal reorganization and renewal. [4] A third aspect is oriented to public policy as to economic regulation , [5] antitrust law , [6] and, more generally, the economic governance of law in defining property rights, enforcing contracts, and providing organizational infrastructure . [7] [8]
The subject has a theoretical side and a practical side. According to one textbook: "On one plane the field is abstract, a set of analytical concepts about competition and monopoly. On a second plane the topic is about real markets, teeming with the excitement and drama of struggles among real firms" (Shepherd, W.; 1985; 1).
The extensive use of game theory in industrial economics has led to the export of this tool to other branches of microeconomics , such as behavioral economics and corporate finance . Industrial organization has also had significant practical impacts on antitrust law and competition policy . [9]
The development of industrial organization as a separate field owes much to Edward Chamberlin , [10] Edward S. Mason , [11] J. M. Clark , [12] and particularly Joe S. Bain [13] among others. [14] [15]
Assessments of the subject have differed over time. The preface to a related research volume in 1972 remarked on Whither industrial organization? : "That all is not well with this in this once flourishing field is readily apparent." [16] A response came 15 years later: "[T]oday's verdict is that industrial organization is alive and well and the queen of applied microeconomics." [17]

Subareas
The Journal of Economic Literature (JEL) classification codes are one way of representing the range of economics subjects and subareas. There, Industrial Organization, one of 20 primary categories, has 9 secondary categories, each with multiple tertiary categories. [18] The secondary categories are listed below with corresponding available article-preview links of The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics Online and footnotes to their respective JEL-tertiary categories and associated New-Palgrave links.

Market structures
The common market structures studied in this field are the following:

Areas of study
Industrial organization investigates the outcomes of these market structures in environments with

History of the field
A 2009 book Pioneers of Industrial Organization traces the development of the field from Adam Smith to recent times and includes dozens of short biographies of major figures in Europe and North America who contributed to the growth and development of the discipline. [28]

Free Software Foundation
The Free Software Foundation ( FSF ) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization founded by Richard Stallman on 4 October 1985 to support the free software movement , which promotes the universal freedom to study, distribute, create, and modify computer software , [4] with the organization's preference for software being distributed under copyleft ("share alike") terms, [5] such as with its own GNU General Public License . [6] The FSF was incorporated in Massachusetts , USA , where it is also based. [7]
From its founding until the mid-1990s, FSF's funds were mostly used to employ software developers to write free software for the GNU Project . Since the mid-1990s, the FSF's employees and volunteers have mostly worked on legal and structural issues for the free software movement and the free software community .
Consistent with its goals, the FSF aims to use only free software on its own computers. [8]

History
The Free Software Foundation was founded in 1985 as a non-profit corporation supporting free software development. It continued existing GNU projects such as the sale of manuals and tapes , and employed developers of the free software system. [9] Since then, it has continued these activities, as well as advocating for the free software movement. The FSF is also the steward of several free software licenses, meaning it publishes them and has the ability to make revisions as needed. [10]
The FSF holds the copyrights on many pieces of the GNU system, such as GNU Compiler Collection . As holder of these copyrights, it has the authority to enforce the copyleft requirements of the GNU General Public License (GPL) when copyright infringement occurs on that software.
From 1991 until 2001, GPL enforcement was done informally, usually by Stallman himself, often with assistance from FSF's lawyer, Eben Moglen . [ citation needed ] Typically, GPL violations during this time were cleared up by short email exchanges between Stallman and the violator. [ citation needed ] In the interest of promoting copyleft assertiveness by software companies to the level that the FSF was already doing, in 2004 Harald Welte launched gpl-violations.org .
In late 2001, Bradley M. Kuhn (then Executive Director), with the assistance of Moglen, David Turner, and Peter T. Brown , formalized these efforts into FSF's GPL Compliance Labs. From 2002-2004, high-profile GPL enforcement cases, such as those against Linksys and OpenTV , became frequent. [11] [12] [13]
GPL enforcement and educational campaigns on GPL compliance was a major focus of the FSF's efforts during this period. [14] [15]
In March 2003, SCO filed suit against IBM alleging that IBM's contributions to various free software , including FSF's GNU , violated SCO's rights. While FSF was never a party to the lawsuit, FSF was subpoenaed on November 5, 2003. [16] During 2003 and 2004, FSF put substantial advocacy effort into responding to the lawsuit and quelling its negative impact on the adoption and promotion of free software. [17] [18]
From 2003 to 2005, FSF held legal seminars to explain the GPL and the surrounding law. [19] Usually taught by Bradley M. Kuhn and Daniel Ravicher , these seminars offered CLE credit and were the first effort to give formal legal education on the GPL. [18] [20] [21]
In 2007, the FSF published the third version of the GNU General Public License after significant outside input. [22] [23]
In December 2008, FSF filed a lawsuit against Cisco for using GPL-licensed components shipped with Linksys products. Cisco was notified of the licensing issue in 2003 but Cisco repeatedly disregarded its obligations under the GPL. [24] In May 2009, FSF dropped the lawsuit when Cisco agreed to make a monetary donation to the FSF and appoint a Free Software Director to conduct continuous reviews of the company's license compliance practices. [25]

Current and ongoing activities

High priority projects
The FSF maintains a list of "high priority projects" to which the Foundation claims that " there is a vital need to draw the free software community 's attention ". [33] The FSF considers these projects " important because computer users are continually being seduced into using non-free software , because there is no adequate free replacement. " [33]
Current high priority tasks include reverse engineering proprietary firmware; reversible debugging in GNU Debugger ; developing automatic transcription and video editing software, Coreboot , drivers for network routers and creating replacements for Skype , Google Earth , OpenDWG libraries, BitTorrent Sync and Oracle Forms . [33]
Previous projects highlighted as needing work included the Free Java implementations , GNU Classpath , and GNU Compiler for Java , which ensure compatibility for the Java part of OpenOffice.org , and the GNOME desktop environment (see Java: Licensing ). [34]
The effort has been criticized by Michael Larabel for either not instigating active development or for being slow at the work being done, even after certain projects were added to the list. [35] [36]

Hardware endorsements (RYF)
The FSF maintains a "Respects Your Freedom" (RYF) hardware certification program. To be granted certification, a product must use 100% Free Software, allow user installation of modified software, be free of back doors and conform with several other requirements. [37]
Currently, a total of eight products have been granted the certification, including three laptops , a 3D printer , a wireless router , and three USB interface wireless adapters . [38]
The eight certified products are:

Structure

Board
The FSF's board of governors includes amongst themselves professors at leading universities, senior engineers, and founders. A few high-profile activists, and software businessmen are admitted as well. Currently on the board there is one high-profile activist, and one world-class, software-campaign strategist (Windows 95, et al. ). There was once a majorly contributing programmer (Mono and Gnome) and businessman who lost favor badly. Founders are also major software developers of the free software in the Gnu Project.
John Sullivan is the current FSF Executive Director. Previous members that occupied the position were Peter T. Brown (2005–2010) and Bradley M. Kuhn (2001–2005).
Current board members:
Previous board members include:

Voting
The FSF Articles of Organization state that the Board of Directors are elected. [47]
The bylaws say who can vote for them. [48]
The Board can grant powers to the Voting Membership. [49]

Employment
At any given time, there are usually around a dozen employees. [50] Most, but not all, work at the FSF headquarters in Boston, Massachusetts . [51]

Membership
On November 25, 2002, the FSF launched the FSF Associate Membership program for individuals. [52] Bradley M. Kuhn (FSF Executive Director, 2001–2005) launched the program and also signed up as the first Associate Member [53]
Associate members hold a purely honorary and funding support role to the FSF. [49]

Legal
Eben Moglen and Dan Ravicher previously served individually as pro bono legal counsel to the FSF. After forming the Software Freedom Law Center , Eben Moglen continued to serve as the FSF's general counsel until 2016. [54]

Financial
Most of the FSF funding comes from patrons and members. [55] Revenue streams also come from free-software-related compliance labs, job postings, published works, and a web store . FSF offers speakers and seminars for pay, and all FSF projects accept donations.
Revenues fund free-software programs and campaigns, while cash is invested conservatively in socially responsible investing . The financial strategy is designed to maintain the Foundation's long-term future through economic stability.
The FSF is a tax-exempt organization and posts annual IRS Form 990 filings online. [2]

Criticism
Linus Torvalds has criticized FSF for using GPLv3 as a weapon in the fight against DRM . Torvalds argues that the issue of DRM and that of a software license should be treated as two separate issues. [56]
On June 16, 2010, Joe Brockmeier, a journalist at Linux Magazine , criticized the Defective by Design campaign by the FSF as "negative" and "juvenile" and not being adequate for providing users with "credible alternatives" to proprietary software. [57] FSF responded to this criticism by saying "that there is a fundamental difference between speaking out against policies or actions and smear campaigns", and "that if one is taking an ethical position, it is justified, and often necessary, to not only speak about the benefits of freedom but against acts of dispossession and disenfranchisement." [58]

Recognition
The free software movement has become recognized as a global cultural movement, and the Free Software Foundation has become recognized as an industry player in software, publishing, economics, jurisprudence, politics, and other cultural realms.
Key players and industries that have made honorific mention and awards include:

Answers.com
Answers.com is an Internet-based knowledge exchange , which includes WikiAnswers , ReferenceAnswers, VideoAnswers, and five international language Q&A communities. The Answers.com domain name was purchased by entrepreneurs Bill Gross and Henrik Jones at idealab in 1996. [1] The domain name was acquired by NetShepard and subsequently sold to GuruNet. The website is the primary product of the Answers Corporation (previously GuruNet), an Internet reference and Q&A company, founded by Bob Rosenschein , Mark Tebbe and Mort Meyerson in 1999. The site supports English, French, Italian, German, Spanish, and Tagalog . WikiAnswers is a community-generated social knowledge Q&A platform, using wiki-based technologies. [2]

History
GuruNet was founded in Jerusalem, Israel , in 1999 to develop technology that intelligently and automatically integrates and retrieves information from disparate sources and delivers the result in a single consolidated view to the user. GuruNet initially displayed its information through a downloadable software product, today known as 1-Click Answers . The product was launched as a free product in 1999. Beginning in 2003 it was sold to users on a perpetual license base and later as an annual subscription. [3]
On October 2004 GuruNet had an IPO on the American Stock Exchange (AMEX) under the symbol "GRU" and also acquired the Answers.com domain name early the same year for $80,000. [4]
On January 2005 the company moved to a new business model of a free-to-customer product, Answers.com and 1-Click Answers software, containing practically all the content that was sold via subscriptions. The new model is based on generating advertising revenue. [3]
On August 2, 2005, the company's shares started trading on NASDAQ instead of AMEX under the symbol "ANSW". [4]
On October 17, 2005, GuruNet changed its corporate name to Answers Corporation, unifying the company's name and its website, Answers.com. [4]
From 2005 to late 2009, the Google search engine definitions feature, in the top-right corner of the site, was linked to Answers.com. [ citation needed ]
On July 2, 2006, Answers.com released a trivia game known as blufr . [ citation needed ]
In the fall of 2009, Answers.com launched a revamped version of their website, which combined wiki-style contributions with expert resources. [5] [6]
At Jeff Pulver 's 140 Characters Conference in New York City in April 2010, Answers.com launched its alpha version of a Twitter -answering service nicknamed 'Hoopoe.' When tweeting a question to the site's official Twitter account, @AnswersDotCom, an automatic reply is given with a snippet of answer and a link to the full answer page on Answers.com. [7]
Aside from providing community-generated Q&A and reference information for published titles, Answers.com began offering videos as part of its VideoAnswers library, in July 2010. This was part of a partnership with video site 5min. [8]
In September 2010, blufr was relaunched with new design, game modes, and social features. It is available on the web and as an iPhone/iPod Touch app in the iTunes app store.
It was announced in November 2010 that the Answers.com Q&A wiki community reached its 10 millionth answer. [9]
At the start of 2011, the site surpassed 11 million answers. Shortly after, on February 3, Answers.com announced in a press release that it had agreed to be acquired by AFCV Holdings for $127 million in cash. AFCV Holdings, LLC, is a portfolio company of growth equity investor Summit Partners . Bob Rosenschein was quoted: "The acquisition price of $10.50 per share represents a significant cash premium of approximately 33% over our 90-day volume-weighted average closing stock price." [10] [11] [12]
On April 23, 2012 TA Associates announced that it was joining as an additional private investor in Answers.com and on May 1, 2012 laid off the remaining development staff in the Jerusalem office as a first step in fully assimilating the company. [13]
On August 8, 2012, reports surfaced that Answers.com had reached a preliminary agreement to acquire About.com from The New York Times Company for $270 million of debt and equity. [14] However, it was thwarted by IAC , who countered with a $300 million "clean cash" offer. [15]
On December 23, 2013 Answers.com acquired ForeSee Results, Inc., a customer experience & customer survey analytics company based in Ann Arbor, Michigan , USA. [16] Answers.com proceeded to lay off between 50 and 75 employees one month after the acquisition, followed by another 100 laysoffs 18 months later. [17]
In March 2017, Answers.com parent company, Answers Corp, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. [18]

List of Wikipedia mobile applications
A number of organizations within the Wikimedia movement including the Wikimedia Foundation publishes official Wikipedia mobile apps for using Wikipedia on multiple mobile device operating systems . All are available for free via the appropriate app store : Android (via Google Play ), iOS (via App Store ), Firefox OS (via Firefox Marketplace), and Windows 8 (via Windows Store ). They can also be downloaded independently of any third party store, from the Wikimedia Foundation's " releases " website, which also keeps old and beta versions .
Independent developers have also released many unofficial apps for reading Wikipedia articles. Some apps load content from the Wikipedia site and process it; other apps use the MediaWiki API . Some only display Wikipedia content, usually omitting some features such as categories and talk pages. Some allow editing.

Official apps

Wikimedia Foundation
Wikipedia apps from the Wikimedia Foundation are called "Wikipedia", except for the iOS version which is called "Wikipedia Mobile".

Wikimedia Switzerland
Wikimedia CH , the Swiss chapter of the Wikimedia movement, has developed a number of offline apps based on Wikipedia content.

Unassociated apps
These apps were mainly developed to display articles and are often used on platforms for which an official Wikipedia app is not available, such as Windows Phone . Typical features include searching for articles, bookmarks , sharing, or enlarging images .

Related apps
A number of apps for Wikipedia's sister projects exist. These include the Wiki Loves Monuments app, written for a 2012 photo contest, is an aid for Wikiphotographers. It shows a map of nearby national heritage register items, indicating whether Wikipedia had a photo for the site, and enabling quick and easy photo uploads for camera phones. It is not integrated with the official article display app. [15]
There are also an iOS and Android app for Wikimedia Commons [16] and an Android app for Wiktionary . [17]

DuckDuckGo
DuckDuckGo ( DDG ) is an Internet search engine that emphasizes protecting searchers' privacy and avoiding the filter bubble of personalized search results. [3] DuckDuckGo distinguishes itself from other search engines by not profiling its users and by deliberately showing all users the same search results for a given search term. [5] DuckDuckGo emphasizes returning the best results, rather than the most results, and generates those results from over 400 individual sources, including key crowdsourced sites such as Wikipedia , and other search engines like Bing , Yahoo! , Yandex , and Yummly . [6] [7]
The company is based in 20 Paoli Pike, Paoli, Pennsylvania , in Greater Philadelphia , and has 21 employees. The company name originates from the children's game duck, duck, goose . [8] [9]
Some of DuckDuckGo's source code is free software hosted at GitHub under the Apache 2.0 License , [10] but the core is proprietary. On 21 May 2014, DuckDuckGo launched a redesigned version that focused on smarter answers and a more refined look. The new version added often requested features such as images, local search, auto-suggest and more. [11]
On 18 September 2014, Apple included DuckDuckGo in its Safari browser as an optional search engine. [12] [13] On 10 November 2014, Mozilla added DuckDuckGo as a search option to Firefox 33.1. [14]

History
DuckDuckGo was founded in 2008 [15] by Gabriel Weinberg, [16] [17] an entrepreneur whose previous venture, The Names Database , was acquired by United Online in 2006 for $10 million. [18] Initially self-funded by Weinberg, DuckDuckGo is now advertising -supported but the user has the option to disable ads. [19] The search engine is written in Perl [20] and runs on nginx , FreeBSD and Linux . [3] [21] [22]
DuckDuckGo is built primarily upon search APIs from various vendors. Because of this, TechCrunch characterized the service as a "hybrid" search engine. [23] [24] At the same time, it produces its own content pages, and thus is similar to Mahalo , Kosmix and SearchMe . [25]
Weinberg explained the beginnings of the name with respect to the children's game duck, duck, goose . He said of the origin of the name, "Really it just popped in my head one day and I just liked it. It is certainly influenced/derived from duck duck goose, but other than that there is no relation, e.g., a metaphor." [26] DuckDuckGo has been featured on TechCrunch 's Elevator Pitch Friday [23] and it was a finalist in the BOSS Mashable Challenge. [27]
In July 2010, Weinberg started a DuckDuckGo community website to allow the public to report problems, discuss means of spreading the use of the search engine, request features, and discuss open sourcing the code. [29]
In September 2011 DuckDuckGo hired its first employee, Caine Tighe. [30] The next month, Union Square Ventures invested in DuckDuckGo. Union Square partner Brad Burnham stated, "We invested in DuckDuckGo because we became convinced that it was not only possible to change the basis of competition in search, it was time to do it." [31] In addition, Trisquel , Linux Mint and the Midori web browser switched to use DuckDuckGo as their default search engine. [32]
By May 2012, the search engine was attracting 1.5 million searches a day. Weinberg reported that it had earned US$115,000 in revenue in 2011 and had three employees, plus a small number of contractors. [33] Compete.com estimated 277,512 monthly visitors to the site in August 2012. [34] On April 12, 2011, Alexa reported a 3-month growth rate of 51%. [35] DuckDuckGo's own traffic statistics show that in August 2012 there were 1,393,644 visits per day, up from an average of 39,406 visits per day in April 2010 (the earliest data available). [36]
In a lengthy profile in November 2012, the Washington Post indicated that searches on DuckDuckGo numbered up to 45,000,000 per month in October 2012. The article concluded "Weinberg's non-ambitious goals make him a particularly odd and dangerous competitor online. He can do almost everything that Google or Bing can't because it could damage their business models, and if users figure out that they like the DuckDuckGo way better, Weinberg could damage the big boys without even really trying. It's asymmetrical digital warfare, and his backers at Union Square Ventures say Google is vulnerable." [8]
GNOME replaced Google Search with DuckDuckGo as the default search engine in Web , the default GNOME web browser, starting with version 3.10, which was released on September 26, 2013. [37] [38] At its keynote at WWDC 2014, Apple announced that DuckDuckGo would be included as an option for search on both iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite . [39]
On March 10, 2014 the Pale Moon web browser, starting with version 24.4.0, included DuckDuckGo as its default search engine as well as listed it on the browser's homepage. [40]
In May 2014, DuckDuckGo released a redesigned version to beta testers through DuckDuckHack. [41] On 21 May 2014, DuckDuckGo officially released the redesigned version that focused on smarter answers and a more refined look. The new version added many new features such as images, local search, auto-suggest, weather, recipes and more. [11]

Overview
DuckDuckGo's results are a compilation of "over 400" sources, [42] including Yahoo! Search BOSS ; Wikipedia ; Wolfram Alpha ; Bing ; its own Web crawler , the DuckDuckBot ; and others. [3] [42] [43] It also uses data from crowdsourced sites, including Wikipedia, to populate "Zero-click Info" boxes – grey boxes above the results that display topic summaries and related topics. [44]
DuckDuckGo positions itself as a search engine that puts privacy first and as such it does not store IP addresses, does not log user information and uses cookies only when needed. Weinberg states "By default, DuckDuckGo does not collect or share personal information. That is our privacy policy in a nutshell." However, they do maintain logs of all search terms used. [45]
Weinberg has refined the quality of his search engine results by deleting search results for companies he believes are content mills , like Demand Media 's eHow , which publishes 4000 articles per day produced by paid freelance writers, which Weinberg says is, "...low-quality content designed specifically to rank highly in Google's search index." DuckDuckGo also filters pages with substantial advertising. [46]

Instant Answers
In addition to the indexed search results, DuckDuckGo displays relevant results, called Instant Answers, [47] on top of the search page. These Instant Answers are collected from either 3rd party APIs or static data sources like text files. The Instant Answers are called zeroclickinfo because the intention behind these is to provide what the user is searching for on the search result page itself so that the user doesn't have to click any results to find what they are looking for. As of August 20, 2016, there are 989 Instant Answers active.
The Instant Answers are open source. [48] They are maintained on Github and anyone can build or work on them.

Tor hidden service
In August 2010, DuckDuckGo introduced anonymous searching, including an exit enclave, for its search engine traffic using Tor network and enabling access through a Tor hidden service . [49] [50] This allows anonymity by routing traffic through a series of encrypted relays. Weinberg stated: "I believe this fits right in line with our privacy policy. Using Tor and DDG, you can now be end to end anonymous with your searching. And if you use our encrypted homepage, you can be end to end encrypted as well." [51]

Voice search
In 2011, DuckDuckGo introduced voice search for users of the Google Chrome 's voice search extension. [52]

Bangs
DuckDuckGo includes "!Bang" commands, which give users the ability to conveniently search on specific websites – using the site's own search engine if applicable. [53] For example, searching for !w climate on DuckDuckgo will instantly return Wikipedia's Climate entry.

Business model
DuckDuckGo earns revenue in two ways: [54]

Reception
In a June 2011 article, Harry McCracken of Time magazine commended DuckDuckGo, comparing it to his favorite hamburger restaurant, In-N-Out Burger :
The barebones approach cited in his quote have since changed; DuckDuckGo now has auto-completion and instant results for example. McCracken included the site in Time' s list of "50 Best Websites of 2011". [56]
Thom Holwerda, who reviewed the search engine for OSNews , praised its privacy features and shortcuts to site-specific searches as well as criticizing Google for "track[ing] pretty much everything you do", particularly because of the risk of such information being subject to a U.S. government subpoena. [57] In 2012, in response to accusations that it was a monopoly, Google identified DuckDuckGo as a competitor. Weinberg was reportedly "pleased and entertained" by that acknowledgment. [8]

Traffic
In June 2013, DuckDuckGo indicated that it had seen a significant traffic increase; according to the website's Twitter account, on Monday June 17, 2013, it had three million daily direct searches. On average during May 2013, it had 1.8 million daily direct searches. Some [61] relate this claim to the exposure of PRISM and to the fact that other programs operated by the National Security Agency (NSA) were leaked by Edward Snowden . Danny Sullivan wrote on Search Engine Land that despite the search engine's growth "it's not grown anywhere near the amount to reflect any substantial or even mildly notable switching by the searching public" for reasons due to privacy, and he concluded "No One Cares About "Private" Search". [62] In response, Caleb Garling of the San Francisco Chronicle argued: "I think this thesis suffers from a few key failures in logic" because a traffic increase had occurred and because there was a lack of widespread awareness of the existence of DuckDuckGo. [63] Later in September 2013, the search engine hit 4 million searches per day. [64] [65] [66] On March 23, 2015, DuckDuckGo retrieved more than 9 million searches for the first day in its history. That month also saw the search engine retrieve more than 250 million searches, another record for the company. [67]

Print on demand
Print on demand ( POD ) is a printing technology and business process in which book copies (or other documents) do not print until the company receives an order, allowing prints of singular or small quantities. While other industries established the build to order business model, "print on demand" could only develop after the beginning of digital printing , [1] because it was not economical to print single copies using traditional printing technology such as letterpress and offset printing .
Many traditional small presses have replaced their traditional printing equipment with POD equipment or contract their printing to POD service providers. Many academic publishers , including university presses , use POD services to maintain large backlists (lists of older publications); some use POD for all of their publications. [2] Larger publishers may use POD in special circumstances, such as reprinting older, out of print titles or for test marketing. [3]

Predecessors
Before the introduction of digital printing technology, production of small numbers of publications had many limitations. Large print jobs were not a problem, but small numbers of printed pages were typically during the early 20th century produced using stencils and reproducing on a mimeograph or similar machine. [4] These produced printed pages of inferior quality to a book, cheaply and reasonably fast. By about 1950, electrostatic copiers were available to make paper master plates for offset duplicating machines. From about 1960 copying onto plain paper became possible for photocopy machines to make multiple good-quality copies of a monochrome original. [4] As technology advanced it became possible to store text in digital form—- paper tape , punched cards readable by digital computer , magnetic mass storage , etc.—- and to print on a teletypewriter , line printer or other computer printer, but the software and hardware to produce original good-quality printed colour text and graphics and to print small jobs fast and cheaply was unavailable.

Book publishing
Print on demand with digital technology is a way to print items for a fixed cost per copy, regardless of the size of the order. While the unit price of each physical copy is greater than with offset printing , the average cost is lower for very small print jobs, because setup costs are much greater for offset printing.
POD has other business benefits besides lesser costs (for small jobs):
These advantages reduce the risks associated with publishing books and prints and can result in increased choice for consumers. However, the reduced risks for the publisher can also mean that quality control is less rigorous than usual.

Other publishing
Digital technology is ideally suited to publish small print jobs of posters (often as a single copy) when they are needed. The introduction of ultraviolet -curable inks and media for large format inkjet printers has allowed artists, photographers and owners of image collections to take advantage of print on demand.
For example, UK art retailer King and McGaw fulfils many of its art print orders by printing on demand rather than pre-printing and storing them until they are sold, requiring less space and reducing overheads to the business. [5] This was brought about after a fire destroyed £3 million worth of stock and damage to their warehouse. [6]

Service providers
The introduction of POD technologies and business-models has created a range of new book-creation and publishing opportunities. There are three main categories of offerings.

Self-publishing authors
POD creats a new category of publishing (or printing) company that offers services, usually for a fee, directly to authors who wish to self-publish . These services generally include printing and shipping each individual book ordered, handling royalties, and getting listings in online bookstores. The initial investment required for POD services is less than for offset printing . Other services may also be available, including formatting, proofreading, and editing, but such companies typically do not spend money for marketing, unlike conventional publishers. Such companies are suitable for authors prepared to design and promote their work themselves, with minimal assistance and at minimal cost. POD publishing gives authors editorial independence, speed to market, ability to revise content, and greater financial return per copy than royalties paid by conventional publishers.

POD enablement
While amateur/professional writers are targeted as early adopters by companies like Infinity Publishing and Trafford Publishing , there is an effort presently to make POD more mass-market . A class of companies like Lulu , Picaboo , Blurb , Peecho and QooP have chosen to be "author agnostic", attempting to serve a broad mass-market of ordinary citizens who may want to express, record and print keepsake copies of memories and personal writing (diaries, travelogues, wedding journals, baby books, family reunion reports etc.). Instead of tailoring themselves to the classic book format (100+ pages, mostly text, complex rules for copyright and royalties), these companies strive to make POD more mass-market by creating programs by which a range of different text and picture items can be produced as finished books. The management of copyrights and royalties is often less important for this market, as the books themselves have a small clientele (close family and friends, for instance).
The major photo storage services (e.g. Eastman Kodak 's Ofoto and Shutterfly and Hewlett-Packard 's Snapfish ) have included the ability to produce picture books and calendars. However, they emphasize digital photography. The companies Blurb and Lulu apply this method to a greater volume of creative work (primarily text, as typed in personal weblogs), and include the capability to embed photographs, and other media. QooP and Peecho assume the role of an infrastructure service provider, allowing any partner website to use its pre-designed payment and printing functions. The program Peecho provides an embeddable print button.

Publisher use
Print-on-demand services that offer printing and distributing services to publishing companies (instead of directly to self-publishing authors) are also growing in popularity within the industry.

Maintaining availability
Among traditional publishers, POD services can be used to make sure that books remain available when one print job has sold out, but another has not yet become available. This maintains the availability of older titles the estimated future sales of which may not be great enough to justify a further conventional print job. This can be useful for publishers with large backlists, such that sales for individual titles may be few but cumulative sales may be significant.

Managing uncertainty
Print on demand can be used to reduce risk when dealing with "surge" titles that are expected to have large sales but a brief sales life (such as biographies of minor celebrities, or event tie-ins): these titles represent good profitability but also great risk owing to the danger of inadvertently printing many more copies than are necessary, and the associated costs of maintaining excess inventory or pulping. POD allows a publisher to use cheaper conventional printing to produce enough copies to satisfy a pessimistic forecast of the title's sales, and then rely on POD to make up the difference.

Niche publications
Print on demand is also used to print and reprint "niche" books that may have a high retail price but limited sales opportunities, such as specialist academic works. An academic publisher may be expected to keep these specialist titles in print even though the target market is almost saturated, making further conventional print jobs uneconomic.
The local history of a small community is well adapted to print-on-demand, as these books are invaluable to libraries, museums and archives in that small community but are limited in their marketability outside their home region. Public libraries which normally avoid print-on-demand tomes due to their lesser quality will readily make exceptions if content is appropriate for a local topic which cannot be addressed by more conventional means [ citation needed ] .
Many of the smallest small presses, often known as micro-presses because they have inconsequential profits, have become reliant on POD technology and ebooks . This is either because they serve such a small market that print jobs would be unprofitable or because they are too small to absorb much financial risk.

Variable formats
Print on demand also allows for books to be printed in a variety of formats. This process, known as accessible publishing , allows books to be printed in a variety of larger type sizes and special formats for those with vision impairment or reading disabilities, as well as personalised typefaces and formats that suit an individual reader's needs. [7] This has been championed by a variety of new companies.

Economics
Profits from print on demand publishing are on a per-sale basis, and royalties vary depending on the method by which the item is sold. Greatest profits are usually generated from sales direct from a print-on-demand service's website or by the author buying copies from the service at a discount, as the publisher, and then selling them personally. Lesser royalties come from traditional bookshops and online retailers both of which buy at high discount, although some POD companies allow the publisher or author to set their own discount level. Unless the publisher or author has fixed their discount rate, the greater the volume sold the less the royalty becomes, as the retailer is able to buy at greater discount.
Because the per-unit cost is typically greater with POD than with a print job of thousands of copies, it is common for POD books to be more expensive than similar books made by conventional print jobs, especially if a book is produced exclusively with POD instead of using POD as a supplemental technology between print jobs.
Book stores order books through a wholesaler or distributor, usually at high discount of as much as 70 percent. Wholesalers obtain their books in two ways: either as a special order such that the book is ordered direct from a publisher when a book store requests a copy, or as a stocked title which they keep in their own warehouse as part of their inventory. Stocked titles are usually also available via sale or return, meaning that the book store can return unsold stock for full credit as much as one year after the initial sale.
POD books are rarely if ever available on such terms because for the publishing provider it is considered too much of a risk. However, wholesalers monitor what titles they are selling, and if authors promote their work successfully and achieve a reasonable number of orders from book stores or online retailers (who use the same wholesalers as the stores), then there is a reasonable chance of their work becoming available on such terms.
Although returnability lessens the risk for book stores, only a certain proportion of such stock can be returned. Non-returnability can make bookstores less enthusiastic about POD books.
Many print-on-demand titles are debut works; [ citation needed ] many bookstores are reluctant to risk an author's first, untested work without the endorsement of a commercial publisher.

Wikidata
Wikidata is a collaboratively edited knowledge base operated by the Wikimedia Foundation . It is intended to provide a common source of data which can be used by Wikimedia projects such as Wikipedia , [2] [3] and by anyone else, under a public domain licence. This is similar to the way Wikimedia Commons provides storage for media files and access to those files for all Wikimedia projects, and which are also freely available for reuse. Wikidata is powered by the software Wikibase. [4]

Concepts
Wikidata is a document-oriented database , focused on items. Each item represents a topic (or an administrative page used to maintain Wikipedia) and is identified by a unique number, prefixed with the letter Q—for example, the item for the topic Politics is Q7163 . This enables the basic information required to identify the topic the item covers to be translated without favouring any language.
Information is added to items by creating statements. Statements take the form of key-value pairs , with each statement consisting of a property (the key) and a value linked to the property.

Development history
The creation of the project was funded by donations from the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence , the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation , and Google, Inc. , totaling € 1.3 million. [5] [6] Initial development of the project is being overseen by Wikimedia Deutschland and has been split into three phases: [7]

Phase 1
Wikidata was launched on 30 October 2012 and was the first new project of the Wikimedia Foundation since 2006. [2] [8] [9] At this time, only the first phase was available. This enabled items to be created and filled with basic information: a label – a name or title, aliases – alternative terms for the label, a description, and links to articles about the topic in all the various language editions of Wikipedia.
Historically, a Wikipedia article would include a list of interlanguage links, being links to articles on the same topic in other editions of Wikipedia, if present. Initially, Wikidata was a self-contained repository of interlanguage links. No Wikipedia language editions were able to access Wikidata, so they needed to continue to maintain their own lists of interlanguage links. On 14 January 2013, the Hungarian Wikipedia became the first to enable the provision of interlanguage links via Wikidata. [10] This functionality was extended to the Hebrew and Italian Wikipedias on 30 January, to the English Wikipedia on 13 February and to all other Wikipedias on 6 March. [11] [12] [13] [14] After no consensus was reached over a proposal to restrict the removal of language links from the English Wikipedia, [15] the power to delete them from the English Wikipedia was granted to automatic editors ( bots ). On 23 September 2013, phase 1 went live on Wikimedia Commons . [16]

Phase 2
The first aspects of the second phase were deployed on 4 February 2013, introducing statements to Wikidata entries. The values were initially limited to two data types (items and images on Wikimedia Commons), with more data types (such as coordinates and dates) to follow later. The first new type, string, was deployed on 6 March. [17]
The ability of the various language editions of Wikipedia to access data added to Wikidata as part of phase two was rolled out progressively between 27 March and 25 April 2013. [18] [19]
On 16 September 2015, Wikidata began allowing so-called arbitrary access , or access to properties of Wikidata items which were not directly connected to it. For example, in the past the article about Berlin you could not access data about Germany, but with arbitrary access it could. [20] On 27 April 2016 arbitrary access was activated on Wikimedia Commons . [21]

Phase 3
Phase 3 will involve database querying and the creation of lists based on data stored on Wikidata. [7] As of October 2016 two tools for querying Wikidata ( Wikidata:List of queries ) were available: AutoList [22] and PetScan, [23] additionally to a public SPARQL endpoint. [24]

Reception
There is concern that the project is being influenced by lobbying companies, PR professionals and search engine optimizers . [25]
As of December 2015 [update] , according to Wikimedia statistics, half of the information in Wikidata is unsourced. [25] Another 30% is labeled as having come from Wikipedia, but with no indication as to which article. [25]

Logo
The bars on the logo contain the word "WIKI" encoded in Morse code . [26]

Reference desk
The reference desk or information desk of a library is a public service counter where professional librarians provide library users with direction to library materials, advice on library collections and services, and expertise on multiple kinds of information from multiple sources.

Purpose and usage
Library users can consult the staff at the reference desk for help in finding information. Using a structured reference interview , the librarian works with the library user to clarify their needs and determine what information sources will fill them. [1] [2] To borrow a medical analogy, reference librarians diagnose and treat information deficiencies.
The ultimate help provided may consist of reading material in the form of a book or journal article, instruction in the use of specific searchable information resources such as the library's online catalog or subscription bibliographic/fulltext databases , or simply factual information drawn from the library's print or online reference collection . Information is also provided to patrons through electronic resources. [2] Typically, a reference desk can be consulted either in person, by telephone, through email or online chat, although a library user may be asked to come to the library in person for help with more involved research questions. A staffed and knowledgeable reference desk is an essential part of a library.
The services that are provided at a reference desk may vary depending on the type of library, its purpose, its resources, and its staff.

History
Reference services did not become commonplace in libraries until the late 1800s. These services initially began in public libraries. [3] At first librarians were hesitant to offer reference services because many libraries did not have a large enough staff to provide the services without other duties being neglected. [3] Beginning in 1883 with the Boston Public Library , libraries began to hire librarians whose primary duty was to provide reference services. [3]
One of the earliest proponents of references services was Samuel Swett Green . He wrote an article titled "Personal Relations Between Librarians and Readers" which had a large impact on the future of reference services. [3] then, it operated to incorporate ... making the following variables relevant in offering reference services: the user's query; the reference librarian; and, the reference sources. Until hitherto the communication between the reference librarian and the user are through direct contact. Hence, Utor(2008), defined reference services as a direct personal assistance to readers seeking information. That is during the traditional era. towards the later decades of 19th century, however, reference and information services witnessed an insidious yet drastic paradigm-shift following the incorporation of information communication technology in reference services (and in library operations, by extension). Thus leading to an entirely new era, otherwise known as digital era with different information technologies coming in to aid the work of a reference librarian; changing information sources, reference processes and communication medium.

Resources
Resources that are often kept at a library reference desk may include:

Services
Services that are often available at a library reference desk include:
The librarian who staffs the reference desk can usually do the following by virtue of their professional training and experience:

Staff qualifications
In the United States , those who staff library reference desks are usually required to have a master's degree in library science [2] from a program accredited by the American Library Association . [4] However, if there is a lack of qualified applicants, particularly in rural areas, a person with an associate degree, a certificate in library technology, or a bachelor's degree in library science may perform these duties. In many academic libraries, student assistants are used as the primary contact, sometimes at an "information desk."
In Sri Lanka , librarians at reference desks typically have master's degrees from the Sri Lankan Library Association's accredited programs.

Electronic reference services
With the development of the Web, digital reference services are beginning to take over some of the roles of the traditional reference desk in a library. There is disagreement over whether or not this development is desirable or inevitable. [5]

Wireless Application Protocol
Wireless Application Protocol ( WAP ) is a technical standard for accessing information over a mobile wireless network . A WAP browser is a web browser for mobile devices such as mobile phones that uses the protocol. Introduced with much hype in 1999, [1] WAP achieved some popularity in the early 2000s, but by the 2010s it had been largely superseded by more modern standards. Most modern handset internet browsers now fully support HTML , so do not need to use WAP markup for webpage compatibility, and most of them are no longer able to render and display pages written in WAP. [2]
Before the introduction of WAP, mobile service providers had limited opportunities to offer interactive data services, but needed interactivity to support Internet and Web applications such as email, stock prices, news and sports headlines. The Japanese i-mode system offered another major competing wireless data protocol.

Technical specifications

WAP Protocol Stack
The WAP standard described a protocol suite or stack [3] allowing the interoperability of WAP equipment, and software with different network technologies, such as GSM and IS-95 (also known as CDMA ).
The bottom-most protocol in the suite, the Wireless Datagram Protocol (WDP), functions as an adaptation layer that makes every data network look a bit like UDP to the upper layers by providing unreliable transport of data with two 16-bit port numbers (origin and destination). All the upper layers view WDP as one and the same protocol, which has several "technical realizations" on top of other "data bearers" such as SMS , USSD , etc. On native IP bearers such as GPRS , UMTS packet-radio service, or PPP on top of a circuit-switched data connection, WDP is in fact exactly UDP.
WTLS , an optional layer, provides a public-key cryptography -based security mechanism similar to TLS .
WTP provides transaction support (reliable request/response) adapted to the wireless world. WTP supports more effectively than TCP the problem of packet loss, which occurs commonly in 2G wireless technologies in most radio conditions, but is misinterpreted by TCP as network congestion.
Finally, one can think of WSP initially as a compressed version of HTTP .
This protocol suite allows a terminal to transmit requests that have an HTTP or HTTPS equivalent to a WAP gateway ; the gateway translates requests into plain HTTP.
The Wireless Application Environment (WAE) space defines application-specific markup languages.
For WAP version 1.X, the primary language of the WAE is Wireless Markup Language (WML). In WAP 2.0, the primary markup language is XHTML Mobile Profile .

WAP Push
WAP Push was incorporated into the specification to allow the WAP content to be pushed to the mobile handset with minimum user intervention. A WAP Push is basically a specially encoded message which includes a link to a WAP address. [4]
WAP Push was specified on top of Wireless Datagram Protocol (WDP); as such, it can be delivered over any WDP-supported bearer, such as GPRS or SMS. [5] Most GSM networks have a wide range of modified processors, but GPRS activation from the network is not generally supported, so WAP Push messages have to be delivered on top of the SMS bearer.
On receiving a WAP Push, a WAP 1.2 (or later) -enabled handset will automatically give the user the option to access the WAP content. This is also known as WAP Push SI ( Service Indication ). [5] A variant, known as WAP Push SL ( Service Loading ), directly opens the browser to display the WAP content, without user interaction. Since this behaviour raises security concerns, some handsets handle WAP Push SL messages in the same way as SI, by providing user interaction.
The network entity that processes WAP Pushes and delivers them over an IP or SMS Bearer is known as a Push Proxy Gateway (PPG). [5]

WAP 2.0
A re-engineered 2.0 version was released in 2002. It uses a cut-down version of XHTML with end-to-end HTTP , dropping the gateway and custom protocol suite used to communicate with it. A WAP gateway can be used in conjunction with WAP 2.0; however, in this scenario, it is used as a standard proxy server. The WAP gateway's role would then shift from one of translation to adding additional information to each request. This would be configured by the operator and could include telephone numbers, location, billing information, and handset information.
Mobile devices process XHTML Mobile Profile (XHTML MP), the markup language defined in WAP 2.0. It is a subset of XHTML and a superset of XHTML Basic . A version of Cascading Style Sheets ( CSS ) called WAP CSS is supported by XHTML MP.

MMS
Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) is a combination of WAP and SMS allowing for sending of picture messages.

History
The WAP Forum was founded in 1998 by Ericsson, Motorola, Nokia and Unwired Planet. [6] It aimed primarily to bring together the various wireless technologies in a standardised protocol. [7] In 2002 the WAP Forum was consolidated (along with many other forums of the industry) into Open Mobile Alliance (OMA). [8]

Europe
The first company to launch a WAP site was Dutch mobile phone operator Telfort BV in October 1999. The site was developed as a side project by Christopher Bee and Euan McLeod and launched with the debut of the Nokia 7110 . Marketers hyped WAP at the time of its introduction, [9] leading users to expect WAP to have the performance of fixed (non-mobile) Internet access . BT Cellnet , one of the UK telecoms , ran an advertising campaign depicting a cartoon WAP user surfing through a Neuromancer -like "information space". [10] In terms of speed, ease of use, appearance and interoperability, the reality fell far short of expectations when the first handsets became available in 1999. [11] [12] This led to the wide usage of sardonic phrases such as "Worthless Application Protocol", [13] "Wait And Pay", [14] and WAPlash. [15]
Between 2003 and 2004 WAP made a stronger resurgence with the introduction of wireless services (such as Vodafone Live!, T-Mobile T-Zones and other easily accessible services). Operator revenues were generated by transfer of GPRS and UMTS data, which is a different business model than that used by the traditional Web sites and ISPs . According to the Mobile Data Association, WAP traffic in the UK doubled from 2003 to 2004. [16]
As of 2013, WAP use has largely disappeared. Most modern handset internet browsers now support full HTML, CSS, and most of Javascript , and do not need to use any kind of WAP markup for webpage compatibility. The list of handsets supporting HTML is extensive, and includes all Android handsets, all Blackberry devices, all versions of the iPhone handset, all devices running Windows Phone, and many Nokia handsets. Most major companies and websites have since retired from the use of WAP and it has not been a mainstream technology for web on mobile for a number of years. [ citation needed ]

Asia
WAP saw major success in Japan. While the largest operator NTT DoCoMo has did not use WAP in favor of its in-house system i-mode , rival operators KDDI ( au ) and SoftBank Mobile (previously Vodafone Japan ) both successfully deployed WAP technology. In particular, J-Phone's Sha-Mail picture mail and Java ( JSCL ) services, as well as ( au )'s chakuuta/chakumovie (ringtone song/ringtone movie) services were based on WAP. Like in Europe, WAP and i-mode usage declined in the 2010s as HTML-capable smartphones became popular in Japan.

USA
The adoption of WAP in the US suffered because many cell phone providers required separate activation and additional fees for data support, and also because telecommunications companies sought to limit data access to only approved data providers operating under license of the signal carrier. [ citation needed ]
In recognition of the problem, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issued an order on 31 July 2007 which mandated that licensees of the 22-megahertz wide "Upper 700 MHz C Block" spectrum would have to implement a wireless platform which allows customers, device manufacturers, third-party application developers, and others to use any device or application of their choice when operating on this particular licensed network band. [17] [18]

Criticism
Commentators criticized several aspects of Wireless Markup Language (WML) and WAP. Technical criticisms include:
Other criticisms address the wireless carriers' particular implementations of WAP:

Protocol design lessons from WAP
The original WAP model provided a simple platform for access to web-like WML services and e-mail using mobile phones in Europe and the SE Asian regions. In 2009 it continued to have a considerable user base. The later versions of WAP, primarily targeting the United States market, were designed [ by whom? ] for a different requirement - to enable full web XHTML access using mobile devices with a higher specification and cost, and with a higher degree of software complexity.
Considerable discussion has addressed the question whether the WAP protocol design was appropriate. Some [ who? ] have suggested that the bandwidth-sparing simple interface of Gopher would be a better match for mobile phones and Personal digital assistants (PDAs). [19]
The initial design of WAP specifically aimed at protocol independence across a range of different protocols (SMS, IP over PPP over a circuit switched bearer, IP over GPRS, etc.). This has led to a protocol considerably more complex than an approach directly over IP might have caused.
Most controversial, especially for many from the IP side, was the design of WAP over IP. WAP's transmission layer protocol, WTP, uses its own retransmission mechanisms over UDP to attempt to solve the problem of the inadequacy of TCP over high-packet-loss networks. [ citation needed ]

WAP influence on modern web sites
The original WAP model served pages in WML. WML was based on the concept of documents known as “decks”, with data in each deck structured into one or more “cards” (pages) – each of which represents a single interaction with the user. With the advent of responsive web design and mobile first approaches the challenges of resizing and adapting content have led to the concept of decks and cards to be recycled [ citation needed ] . Cards are served in rows and columns to match the device's capabilities, and different decks can be delivered to the device based on the network, device and media support capabilities.

Wikipedia Zero
Wikipedia Zero is a project by the Wikimedia Foundation to provide Wikipedia free of charge on mobile phones via zero-rating , particularly in developing markets . [1] [2] The program was launched in 2012, [3] and won a 2013 SXSW Interactive Award for activism. [4] The objective of the program is to increase access to free knowledge: in particular without data-usage cost. With 68 operators in over 52 countries, it is estimated over 309 million people have access to Wikipedia Zero. [5]
Facebook Zero has been cited as an inspiration for Wikipedia Zero. [6]

History
Below is a selective history of launches. For a complete list of participating mobile networks and launch dates, see Wikimedia Foundation: mobile network partners .

Participating mobile networks

Reception and impact
The Subsecretaria de Telecomunicaciones of Chile ruled that zero-rating services like Wikipedia Zero, Facebook Zero, and Google Free Zone, that subsidize mobile data usage, violate net neutrality laws and had to end the practice by June 1, 2014. [22] [23] The Electronic Frontier Foundation has said, "Whilst we appreciate the intent behind efforts such as Wikipedia Zero, ultimately zero rated services are a dangerous compromise." [24] Accessnow.org has been more critical, saying, "Wikimedia has always been a champion for open access to information, but it’s crucial to call out zero-rating programs for what they are: Myopic deals that do great damage to the future of the open internet." [25] The Wikimedia Foundation's Gayle Karen Young defended the program to the Washington Post , saying, "We have a complicated relationship to net neutrality . We believe in net neutrality in America ," while adding that Wikipedia Zero required a different perspective in other countries: "Partnering with telecom companies in the near term, it blurs the net neutrality line in those areas. It fulfills our overall mission, though, which is providing free knowledge." [26]
Hilary Heuler argues that "for many, zero-rated programs would limit online access to the 'walled gardens' offered by the web heavyweights. For millions of users, Facebook and Wikipedia would be synonymous with 'internet'." [27] In 2015, researchers evaluating how the similar program Facebook Zero shapes ICT use in the developing world found that 11% of Indonesians who said they used Facebook also said they did not use the Internet. 65% of Nigerians, and 61% of Indonesians agree with the statement that "Facebook is the Internet" compared with only 5% in the US. [28]
An article in Vice magazine [ citation needed ] notes that the free access via Wikipedia Zero made Wikipedia a preferred way for its users in Bangladesh and elsewhere to share copyrighted material. This caused problems at Wikipedia (where uploading copyrighted media is discouraged) but the article is deeply critical of the Wikipedia Zero project, arguing that because "they can't afford access to YouTube and the rest of the internet, Wikipedia has become the internet for lots of Bangladeshis [and] a bunch of more-or-less random editors who happen to want to be the piracy police are dictating the means of access for an entire population of people."

Status quo
Status quo is a Latin phrase meaning the existing state of affairs , particularly with regard to social or political issues. [1] In the sociological sense, it generally applies to maintain or change existing social structure and values. [2] With regards to policy debate, the status quo refers to how conditions are at the time and how the affirmative team can solve these conditions.
It is the nominal form of the prepositional Latin phrase " in statu quo " – literally "in the state in which", which itself is a shortening of the original phrase in statu quo res erant ante bellum , meaning "in the state in which things were before the war". To maintain the status quo is to keep the things the way they presently are. The related phrase status quo ante , literally "the state in which before", [3] means "the state of affairs that existed previously". [3]

Political usage
The original phrase from 14th-century diplomatic Latin was in statu quo res erant ante bellum , meaning "in the state in which things were before the war". This gave rise to the shorter form status quo ante bellum "the state in which (it was) before war" (indicating the withdrawal of enemy troops and restoration of power to pre-war leadership), as well as other variations such as status quo itself. [ citation needed ] [ clarification needed ]
Social movements are an example of times when the status quo might be challenged. In these instances status quo refers to the current state of affairs around a particular issue, or perhaps the current culture or social climate of an entire society or nation . [4] The status quo is generally perceived negatively by supporters of the social movement, and people who want to maintain the status quo can be seen as being resistant to progress. [5]
Politicians sometimes refer to a status quo. Often there is a policy of deliberate ambiguity, referring to the status quo rather than formalizing the status. Clark Kerr is reported to have said: "The status quo is the only solution that cannot be vetoed ", [6] meaning that the status quo cannot simply be decided against; action must be taken if it is to change. [ citation needed ]
Status quo can also refer to a situation that people find mutually undesirable but the outcome of any changes to it may be overly risky; at the same time they recognize that eventual change will occur, and are open to the potential that a better alternative solution may emerge over time. For example, Taiwan's political status straddles the line of a sovereign state in its own right and a non-sovereign area of China. [ neutrality is disputed ] Neither a full declaration of independence nor a forceful incorporation of the island into China is considered ideal by its main political parties at the current stage. Thus being 'pro status-quo' in this case generally means 'wait-and-see'. [ citation needed ]
Karl Marx viewed organized religion as a means for the bourgeoisie to keep the proletariat content with an unequal status quo, [7] and education is seen by others as a means of maintaining the status quo of society. [8]

Pew Research Center
The Pew Research Center is a nonpartisan American "fact tank", which is based in Washington, D.C. It provides information on social issues , public opinion , and demographic trends shaping the United States and the world. [2] It also conducts public opinion polling , demographic research, media content analysis , and other empirical social science research. Pew Research Center does not take explicit policy positions, and is a subsidiary of The Pew Charitable Trusts . [3] [4]

History
In 1990 the Times Mirror Company founded the Times Mirror Center for the People & the Press as a research project, tasked with conducting polls on politics and policy. Andrew Kohut became its director in 1993, and The Pew Charitable Trusts became its primary sponsor in 1996, when it was renamed the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press . [5]
In 2004, the trust established the Pew Research Center in Washington, D.C. In 2013, Kohut stepped down as president and became founding director, and Alan Murray became the second president of the center. [6] In October 2014, Michael Dimock, a 14-year veteran of the Pew Research Center, was named president. [7]

Funding
The Pew Research Center is a nonprofit, tax-exempt 501(c)(3) organization and a subsidiary of The Pew Charitable Trusts, its primary funder. [4] [8] Some projects are funded by the Evangelical Protestant John Templeton Foundation . [9]

Research areas
The Center's research is divided into seven areas. [1]

Same-sex marriage
Same-sex marriage , also known as gay marriage , is marriage between people of the same sex , either as a secular civil ceremony or in a religious setting.
In the late 20th century, rites of marriage for same-sex couples without legal recognition became increasingly common. The first law providing for marriage of people of the same sex in modern times was enacted in 2001 in the Netherlands . As of 2 May 2017 [update] , same-sex marriage is legally recognized (nationwide or in some parts) in the following countries: Argentina , Belgium , Brazil , Canada , Colombia , Denmark , [nb 1] Finland , France , Iceland , Ireland , Luxembourg , Mexico , [nb 2] the Netherlands , [nb 3] New Zealand , [nb 4] Norway , Portugal , South Africa , Spain , Sweden , the United Kingdom , [nb 5] the United States [nb 6] and Uruguay . Same-sex marriage is likely to soon become legal in Taiwan , after a constitutional court ruling in May 2017. [1] Polls show rising support for legally recognizing same-sex marriage in the Americas , Australia and most of Europe . [2] [3] [4] However, as of 2017, South Africa is the only African country where same-sex marriage is recognized. No country in Asia legally recognises same-sex marriage ceremonies performed under its jurisdiction, although Israel recognises same-sex marriages performed overseas for some purposes. [5]
Introduction of same-sex marriage laws has varied by jurisdiction, being variously accomplished through legislative change to marriage laws , a court ruling based on constitutional guarantees of equality, or by direct popular vote (via ballot initiative or referendum ). The recognition of same-sex marriage is a political and social issue, and also a religious issue in many countries, and debates continue to arise over whether people in same-sex relationships should be allowed marriage or some similar status (a civil union ). [6] [7] [8] Same-sex marriage can provide those in same-sex relationships who pay their taxes with government services and make financial demands on them comparable to those afforded to and required of those in opposite-sex marriages. Same-sex marriage also gives them legal protections such as inheritance and hospital visitation rights. [9] Various faith communities around the world support allowing those of the same sex to marry, while many major religions oppose same-sex marriage. Opponents of same-sex marriages have argued that recognition of same-sex marriages would erode religious freedoms, undermine a right of children to be raised by their biological mother and father or erode the institution of marriage itself.
Some analysts state that financial, psychological and physical well-being are enhanced by marriage, and that children of same-sex parents or carers benefit from being raised by two parents within a legally recognized union supported by society's institutions. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] Court documents filed by American scientific associations also state that singling out gay men and women as ineligible for marriage both stigmatizes and invites public discrimination against them. [15] The American Anthropological Association asserts that social science research does not support the view that either civilization or viable social orders depend upon marriage as an exclusively heterosexual institution. [16]

Terminology

Alternative terms
Some proponents of legal recognition of same-sex marriage, such as Freedom to Marry and Canadians for Equal Marriage , use the terms marriage equality and equal marriage to indicate that they seek equal benefit of marriage laws as opposed to special rights. [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23]
Opponents of the legalization of same-sex marriage sometimes characterize it as redefining marriage or redefined marriage , especially in the United States . [24] [25] The term homosexual marriage is generally used by organisations opposed to same-sex marriage such as the Family Research Council in the United States; [26] that term is rarely used in the mainstream press. [27]
Associated Press style recommends the usages marriage for gays and lesbians or in space-limited headlines gay marriage with no hyphen and no scare quotes. The Associated Press warns that the construct gay marriage can imply that marriages of same-sex couples are somehow legally different from those of mixed-sex couples. [28] [29]

Use of the term 
Anthropologists have struggled to determine a definition of marriage that absorbs commonalities of the social construct across cultures around the world. [30] [31] Many proposed definitions have been criticized for failing to recognize the existence of same-sex marriage in some cultures, including in more than 30 African cultures , such as the Kikuyu and Nuer . [31] [32] [33]
With several countries revising their marriage laws to recognize same-sex couples in the 21st century, all major English dictionaries have revised their definition of the word marriage to either drop gender specifications or supplement them with secondary definitions to include gender-neutral language or explicit recognition of same-sex unions. [34] [35] The Oxford English Dictionary has recognized same-sex marriage since 2000. [36]
Alan Dershowitz and others have suggested reserving the word marriage for religious contexts as part of privatizing marriage , and in civil and legal contexts using a uniform concept of civil unions , in part to strengthen the separation between church and state . [37] Jennifer Roback Morse , the president of the anti-same-sex marriage group National Organization for Marriage 's Ruth Institute project, [38] claims that the conflation of marriage with contractual agreements is a threat to marriage. [39]
Some publications that oppose same-sex marriage, such as WorldNetDaily and Baptist Press , have an editorial style policy of placing the word marriage in scare quotes ("marriage") when it is used in reference to same-sex couples. [ citation needed ] In the United States, the mainstream press has generally abandoned this practice. [27] Cliff Kincaid of the conservative Accuracy in Media argued for use of quotation marks on the grounds that marriage was a legal status denied same-sex couples by most U.S. state governments. [40] Same-sex marriage supporters argue that the use of scare quotes is an editorialization that implies illegitimacy. [41]
Opponents of same-sex marriage such as The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints , the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops , and the Southern Baptist Convention use the term traditional marriage to mean marriages between one man and one woman. [42] [43] [44]

Studies
The American Anthropological Association stated on February 26, 2004: [16]
Research findings from 1998–2014 from the University of Virginia , Michigan State University , Florida State University , the University of Amsterdam , the New York State Psychiatric Institute , Stanford University , the University of California-San Francisco , the University of California-Los Angeles , Tufts University , Boston Medical Center , the Committee on Psychosocial Aspects of Child and Family Health and independent researchers also support the findings of this study. [45]

Health
In 2010, a Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health study examining the effects of institutional discrimination on the psychiatric health of lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) individuals found an increase in psychiatric disorders, including a more than doubling of anxiety disorders , among the LGB population living in states that instituted bans on same-sex marriage. According to the author, the study highlighted the importance of abolishing institutional forms of discrimination, including those leading to disparities in the mental health and well-being of LGB individuals. Institutional discrimination is characterized by societal-level conditions that limit the opportunities and access to resources by socially disadvantaged groups. [46] [47]
Gay activist Jonathan Rauch has argued that marriage is good for all men, whether homosexual or heterosexual, because engaging in its social roles reduces men's aggression and promiscuity. [48] [49] The data of current psychological and other social science studies on same-sex marriage in comparison to mixed-sex marriage indicate that same-sex and mixed-sex relationships do not differ in their essential psychosocial dimensions; that a parent's sexual orientation is unrelated to their ability to provide a healthy and nurturing family environment; and that marriage bestows substantial psychological, social, and health benefits. Same-sex parents and carers and their children are likely to benefit in numerous ways from legal recognition of their families, and providing such recognition through marriage will bestow greater benefit than civil unions or domestic partnerships. [50] [51]
The American Psychological Association stated in 2004: "...Denial of access to marriage to same-sex couples may especially harm people who also experience discrimination based on age, race, ethnicity, disability, gender and gender identity, religion, socioeconomic status and so on." It has also averred that same-sex couples who may only enter into a civil union, as opposed to a marriage, "are denied equal access to all the benefits, rights, and privileges provided by federal law to those of married couples," which has adverse effects on the well-being of same-sex partners. [10]
In 2009, a pair of economists at Emory University tied the passage of state bans on same-sex marriage in the US to an increase in the rates of HIV infection. [52] [53] The study linked the passage of a same-sex marriage ban in a state to an increase in the annual HIV rate within that state of roughly 4 cases per 100,000 population. [54]

Parenting
Many psychologist organizations have concluded that children stand to benefit from the well-being that results when their parents' relationship is recognized and supported by society's institutions, e.g. civil marriage. For example, the Canadian Psychological Association stated in 2006 that "parents' financial, psychological and physical well-being is enhanced by marriage and that children benefit from being raised by two parents within a legally-recognized union." [13] The CPA stated in 2003 the stressors encountered by gay and lesbian parents and their children are more likely the result of the way society treats them than because of any deficiencies in fitness to parent. [13]
The American Academy of Pediatrics concluded in 2006, in an analysis published in the journal Pediatrics : [50]

Opinion polling
Numerous polls and studies on the issue have been conducted, including those that were completed throughout the first decade of the 21st century. A consistent trend of increasing support for same-sex marriage has been revealed across the world. Much of the research that was conducted in developed countries in the first decade of the 21st century shows a majority of people in support of same-sex marriage. Support for legal same-sex marriage has increased across every age group, political ideology, religion, gender, race and region of various developed countries in the world. [55] [56] [57] [58] [59]
Recent polling in the United States has shown a further increase in public support for same-sex marriage. When adults were asked in 2005 if they thought "marriages between homosexuals should or should not be recognized by the law as valid, with the same rights as traditional marriages", 28 percent replied in the affirmative, while 68 percent replied in the negative (the remaining 4 percent stated that they were unsure). When adults were asked in March 2013 if they supported or opposed same-sex marriage, 50 percent said they supported same-sex marriage, while 41 percent were opposed, and the remaining 9 percent stated that they were unsure. [60] Various detailed polls and studies on same-sex marriage that were conducted in several countries show that support for same-sex marriage generally increases with higher levels of education and decreases with age. [61] [62] [63] [64] [65]

History

Ancient
The first historical mention of the performance of same-sex marriages occurred during the early Roman Empire according to controversial [98] historian John Boswell . [99] These were usually reported in a critical or satirical manner. [100] Child emperor Elagabalus referred to his chariot driver, a blond slave from Caria named Hierocles , as his husband. [101] He also married an athlete named Zoticus in a lavish public ceremony in Rome amidst the rejoicings of the citizens. [102] [103]
The first Roman emperor to have married a man was Nero , who is reported to have married two other males on different occasions. The first was with one of Nero's own freedmen , Pythagoras , with whom Nero took the role of the bride. [104] Later, as a groom, Nero married Sporus , a young boy, to replace the adolescent female concubine he had killed [105] and married him in a very public ceremony with all the solemnities of matrimony, after which Sporus was forced to pretend to be the female concubine that Nero had killed and act as though they were really married. [105] A friend gave the "bride" away as required by law. The marriage was celebrated in both Greece and Rome in extravagant public ceremonies. [106]
It should be noted, however, that conubium existed only between a civis Romanus and a civis Romana (that is, between a male Roman citizen and a female Roman citizen), so that a marriage between two Roman males (or with a slave) would have no legal standing in Roman law (apart, presumably, from the arbitrary will of the emperor in the two aforementioned cases). [107] Furthermore, according to Susan Treggiari, " matrimonium was then an institution involving a mother, mater . The idea implicit in the word is that a man took a woman in marriage, in matrimonium ducere , so that he might have children by her." [108] Still, the lack of legal validity notwithstanding, there is a consensus among modern historians that same-sex relationships existed in ancient Rome, though the frequency and nature of "same-sex unions" during that period are obscure. [109]
In 342 AD, Christian emperors Constantius II and Constans issued a law in the Theodosian Code ( C. Th. 9.7.3) prohibiting same-sex marriage in Rome and ordering execution for those so married. [110]

Medieval
A same-sex marriage between two men, Pedro Dias and Muño Vandilas, occurred on 16 April 1061 in the Galician municipality of Rairiz de Veiga in Spain. They were married by a priest at a small chapel. The historic documents about the church wedding were found at Monastery of San Salvador de Celanova . [111]

Renaissance
In the late 16th century, French essayist and philosopher Michel de Montaigne wrote of two same-sex marriages. The first involving two women in eastern France, the second involving two men in Rome . A ceremony was held for the male couple at the Porta Latina , though was later interrupted by police who arrested 11 people present at the ceremony. [112] [113]

Contemporary
Writing in Harvard Magazine in 2013, legal historian Michael Klarman wrote that while there was a growth of gay rights activism in the 1970s United States, "Marriage equality was not then a priority." He argued that many gay people were not initially interested in marriage, deeming it to be a traditionalist institution, and that the search for legal recognition of same-sex relationships began in the late 1980s. [114] Others, such as Faramerz Dabhoiwala writing for The Guardian , say that the modern movement began in the 1990s. [115]
Denmark was the first country to recognize a legal relationship for same-sex couples, establishing "registered partnerships" in 1989. This gave those in same-sex relationships "most rights of married heterosexuals, but not the right to adopt or obtain joint custody of a child". [116] In 2001, the Netherlands [nb 3] became the first country to permit same-sex marriages . [117] Since then same-sex marriages have been permitted and mutually recognized by Belgium (2003), Spain (2005), Canada (2005, but 2003 in the province of Ontario), South Africa (2006), Norway (2009), Sweden (2009), Portugal (2010), Iceland (2010), Argentina (2010), Denmark (2012), [nb 1] Brazil (2013), France (2013), Uruguay (2013), New Zealand (2013), the United Kingdom [nb 5] (2014), Luxembourg (2015), the United States [nb 6] (2015), Ireland (2015), Colombia (2016) and Finland (2017). In Mexico, same-sex marriages are performed in a number of states and recognised in all thirty-one states. In Nepal , their recognition has been judicially mandated but not yet legislated. [118]

Timeline

International organisations

European Court of Human Rights
In 2010, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruled on Schalk and Kopf v Austria , a case involving an Austrian same-sex couple who were denied the right to marry. [119] The court found that their human rights had not been violated, with a result of 3 votes for and 4 votes against. [120]
British judge Sir Nicolas Bratza, then head of the European Court of Human Rights, delivered a speech in 2012 that signalled the court was ready to declare same-sex marriage a "human right", as soon as enough countries fell into line. [121] [122] [123]
Article 12 of the European Convention on Human Rights states that: "Men and women of marriageable age have the right to marry and to found a family, according to the national laws governing the exercise of this right", [124] not limiting marriage to those in a heterosexual relationship. However, the ECHR stated in Schalk and Kopf v Austria that this provision was intended to limit marriage to heterosexual relationships, as it used the term "men and women" instead of "everyone". [119]

European Union
On 12 March 2015, the European Parliament passed a non-binding resolution recognising the right to marry for those of the same sex as a human and civil rights issue. [125] [126] [127]

Same-sex marriage around the world
Same-sex marriage became legal (nationwide or in some parts) in Argentina , Belgium , Brazil , Canada , Colombia , Denmark , [nb 1] Finland , France , Iceland , Ireland , Luxembourg , Mexico , [nb 2] the Netherlands , [nb 3] New Zealand , [nb 4] Norway , Portugal , South Africa , Spain , Sweden , the United Kingdom [nb 5] the United States , [nb 6] and Uruguay .
The status of same-sex marriage is a complicated matter in a number of other nations. In Mexico marriages are recognized by all sub-national jurisdictions and by the federal government. [128] On 3 June 2015, Mexico's Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation released a "jurisprudential thesis" declaring the current purpose of marriage, which is procreation, as unconstitutional and discriminatory towards same-sex relationships. Courts nationwide must now authorize marriages between people of the same-sex through injunctions, a process slower and more expensive than opposite-sex marriage. [129] Israel does not recognize same-sex marriages performed in its territory, but same-sex marriages performed in foreign jurisdictions are recorded strictly "for statistical purposes", thereby avoiding official recognition of same-sex marriages by the state. [130]

Legal recognition

Argentina
On 15 July 2010, the Argentine Senate approved a bill extending marriage rights to same-sex couples. It was supported by the Government of President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner and opposed by the Catholic Church. [131] Polls showed that nearly 70% of Argentines supported giving gay people the same marital rights as heterosexuals. [132] The law came into effect on 22 July 2010 upon promulgation by the Argentine President. [133]

Belgium
Belgium became the second country in the world to legally recognize same-sex marriages when a bill passed by the Belgian Federal Parliament took effect on 1 June 2003. [134] Originally, Belgium allowed the marriages of foreign same-sex couples only if their country of origin also allowed these unions, however legislation enacted in October 2004 permits any couple to marry if at least one of the spouses has lived in the country for a minimum of three months. A 2006 statute legalized adoption by same-sex spouses . [135]

Brazil
Brazil's Supreme Court ruled in May 2011 that same-sex couples are legally entitled to legal recognition of cohabitation (known as união estável , one of the two possible family entities in Brazilian legislation, it includes all family and married couple rights in Brazil – besides automatic opt-in for one of four systems of property share and automatic right to inheritance –, and was available for all same-sex couples since the same date), turning same-sex marriage legally possible as a consequence, and just stopping short of equalization of same-sex marriage (potentially confusing, a civil marriage or casamento civil is often rendered as união civil in legal Brazilian Portuguese; a same-sex marriage is a casamento civil homoafetivo or an união civil homoafetiva ). [136]
Between mid-2011 and May 2013, same-sex couples had their cohabitation issues converted into marriage in several Brazil states with the approval of a state judge. All legal Brazilian marriages were always recognized all over Brazil. [137]
In November 2012, the Court of Bahia equalized marriage in the state of Bahia . [138] [139] In December 2012, the state of São Paulo likewise had same-sex marriage allowed in demand by court order. [140] Same-sex marriages also became equalized in relation to opposite-sex ones between January 2012 and April 2013 by court order in Alagoas, Ceará, Espírito Santo, the Federal District, Mato Grosso do Sul, Paraíba, Paraná, Piauí, Rondônia, Santa Catarina and Sergipe, and in Santa Rita do Sapucaí, a municipality in Minas Gerais; in Rio de Janeiro, the State Court facilitated its realization by district judges in agreement with the equalization (instead of ordering notaries to accept same-sex marriages in demand as all others).
On 14 May 2013, the Justice's National Council of Brazil issues a ruling requiring all civil registers of the country to perform same-sex marriages by a 14–1 vote, thus legalizing same-sex marriage in the entire country. [141] [142] [143] The resolution came into effect on 16 May 2013. [144] [145]
In March 2013, polls suggested that 47% of Brazilians supported marriage equalization and 57% supported adoption equalization for same-sex couples. [146] Polls in June 2013 also supported the conclusion that the division of opinion between acceptance and rejection of same-sex marriage is in about equal halves. When the distinction between same-sex unions that are not termed marriages in relation to same-sex marriage is made, the difference in the numbers of approval and disapproval is still insignificant, below 1%; the most frequent reason for disapproval is a supposed 'unnaturalness' of same-sex relationships, followed by religious beliefs. [147] [148]

Canada
Legal recognition of same-sex marriage in Canada followed a series of constitutional challenges based on the equality provisions of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms . In the first such case, Halpern v. Canada (Attorney General) , same-sex marriage ceremonies performed in Ontario on 14 January 2001 were subsequently validated when the common law , mixed-sex definition of marriage was held to be unconstitutional. Similar rulings had legalized same-sex marriage in eight provinces and one territory when the 2005 Civil Marriage Act defined marriage throughout Canada as "the lawful union of two persons to the exclusion of all others."

Colombia
Same-sex marriage has been legal in Colombia since April 2016. The country's Constitutional Court ruled, on 28 April 2016 that same-sex couples are allowed to enter into civil marriages in the country and that judges and notaries are barred from refusing to perform same-sex weddings. [149] [150] [151] On 7 April 2016, the Court ruled that marriage doesn't only apply to opposite-sex couples. [152] [153] [154] [155] Almost all advances in relationship recognition rights for same-sex couples has come from sweeping rulings of the Court. A series of rulings by the court that started in February 2007 meant that same-sex couples could apply for all the rights that heterosexual couples have in de facto unions ( uniones de hecho ). [156] [157]
On 26 July 2011, the Constitutional Court of Colombia ordered the Congress to pass the legislation giving same-sex couples similar rights to marriage by 20 June 2013. If such a law were not passed by then, same-sex couples would be granted these rights automatically. [158] [159]
In October 2012, Senator Armando Benedetti introduced a bill legalizing same-sex marriage. It initially only allowed for civil unions, but he amended the text. [160] The Senate's First Committee approved the bill on 4 December 2012. [161] [162] On 24 April 2013, the bill was defeated in the full Senate on a 51–17 vote. [163]
On 24 July 2013, a civil court judge in Bogotá declared a male same-sex couple legally married, after a ruling on 11 July 2013 accepting the petition. This was the first same-sex couple married in Colombia. [164] [165]
In September 2013, two civil court judges married two same-sex couples. [166] The first marriage was challenged by a conservative group, and it was initially annulled. Nevertheless, in October a High Court (Tribunal Supremo de Bogotá) maintained the validity of that marriage. [167] [168]

Denmark
On 7 June 2012, the Folketing (Danish Parliament) approved new laws regarding same-sex civil and religious marriage. These laws permit same-sex couples to get married in the Church of Denmark . The bills received royal assent on 12 June and took effect on 15 June 2012. [169] Denmark was previously the first country in the world to legally recognize same-sex couples through registered partnerships in 1989. [170] [171]
On 26 May 2015, Greenland , one of Denmark's two other constituent countries in the Realm of Denmark , unanimously passed a law legalising same-sex marriage. [172] [173] The first same-sex couple to marry in Greenland married on 1 April 2016, the day the law went into effect. [174]
On 17 November 2015, in the Faroe Islands (the realm's other constituent country), a same-sex marriage bill entered Parliament ( Løgting ). The bill passed its second reading on 26 April and was approved at its third reading on 29 April 2016 by 19 votes to 14. [175] [176] The law required ratification in the Danish Parliament , which provided it on 25 April 2017. [177] Despite having received royal assent , the law is not yet in effect.

Finland
Registered partnerships have been legal in Finland since in 2002. [178] In 2010, Minister of Justice Tuija Brax said her Ministry was preparing to amend the Marriage Act to allow same-sex marriage by 2012. [179] On 27 February 2013, the bill was rejected by the Legal Affairs Committee of the Finnish Parliament on a vote of 9–8. A citizens' initiative was launched to put the issue before the Parliament of Finland . [180] The initiative gathered the required 50,000 signatures of Finnish citizens in one day and exceeded 107,000 signatures by the time the media reported the figures. [181] The campaign collected 166,000 signatures and the initiative was presented to the Parliament in December 2013. [182] The initiative went to introductory debate on 20 February 2014 and was sent again to the Legal Affairs Committee. [183] [184] On 25 June, the bill was rejected by the Legal Affairs Committee on a vote of 10–6 and the third time on 20 November 2014, by 9–8. [185] It faced the first vote in full session on 28 November 2014, [186] which passed the bill 105–92. The bill passed the second and final vote by 101–90 on 12 December 2014, [187] and was signed by the President on 20 February 2015. The law took effect on 1 March 2017. [188] It was the first time a citizens' initiative has been approved by the Finnish Parliament. [178]

France
Since November 1999, France has a civil union law that is open to same-sex couples. Following the election of François Hollande as President of France in May 2012 and the subsequent legislative election in which the Socialist party took a majority of seats in the French National Assembly, the new Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault stated that a same-sex marriage bill had been drafted and would be passed. [189] The government introduced a bill to legalize same-sex marriage, Bill 344 , in the National Assembly on 17 November 2012. Article 1 of the bill defining marriage as an agreement between two people was passed on 2 February 2013 in its first reading by a 249–97 vote. On 12 February 2013, the National Assembly approved the entire bill in a 329–229 vote. [190]
On 12 April 2013, the upper house of the French Parliament voted to legalise same-sex marriage. [191] On 23 April 2013, the law was approved by the National Assembly in a 331–225 vote. [192] Law No.2013-404 grants same-sex couples living in France, including foreigners provided at least one of the partners has their domicile or residence in France, the legal right to get married. The law also allows the recognition in France of same-sex couples' marriages that occurred abroad before the bill's enactment. [193]
Following the announcement of the French Parliament's vote results, those in opposition to the legalisation of same-sex marriage in France participated in public protests. In both Paris and Lyon , violence erupted as protesters clashed with police; the issue has mobilised right-wing forces in the country, including neo-Nazis. [194]
The main right-wing opposition party UMP challenged the law in the Constitutional Council , which had one month to rule on whether the law conformed to the Constitution. The Constitutional Council had previously ruled that the issue of same-sex marriage was one for the Parliament to decide and there was only little hope for UMP to overturn the Parliament's vote. [195]
On 17 May 2013, the Constitutional Council declared the bill legal in its entire redaction. President Hollande signed it into law on 18 May 2013. [196]

Iceland
Same-sex marriage was introduced in Iceland through legislation establishing a gender-neutral definition of marriage introduced by the coalition government of the Social Democratic Alliance and Left-Green Movement . The legislation was passed unanimously by the Icelandic Althing on 11 June 2010, and took effect on 27 June 2010, replacing an earlier system of registered partnerships for same-sex couples. [197] [198] Prime Minister Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir and her partner were among the first married same-sex couples in the country. [199]

Ireland
Ireland held a referendum on 22 May 2015. The referendum proposed to add to the Irish Constitution : "marriage may be contracted in accordance with law by two persons without distinction as to their sex". The proposal approved; with 62% of voters supporting same-sex marriage. On 29 August 2015, the Irish President, Michael D. Higgins, signed the result of the May referendum into law, [200] which made Ireland the first country in the world to approve same-sex marriage at a nationwide referendum. [201] Same-sex marriage became formally legally recognised in Ireland on 16 November 2015. [202] Prior to this, the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010 allowed same sex couples to enter civil partnerships. The Act came into force on 1 January 2011 and gave same-sex couples rights and responsibilities similar to, but not equal to, those of civil marriage. [203]

Luxembourg
The Parliament approved a bill to legalise same-sex marriage on 18 June 2014. [204] The law was published in the official gazette on 17 July and took effect on 1 January 2015. [205] [206] [207] On 15 May 2015, Luxembourg became the first country in the EU that has a prime minister who is in a same sex marriage, and the second one in Europe. Prime minister Xavier Bettel married Gauthier Destenay, with whom he had been in a civil partnership since 2010.

Mexico
Same-sex couples can marry in Mexico City and in the states of Campeche , Coahuila , Colima , Jalisco , Michoacán , Morelos , Nayarit and Quintana Roo as well as in some municipalities in Guerrero , Puebla, Querétaro and Tamaulipas. In individual cases, same-sex couples have been given judicial approval to marry in all other states. Since August 2010, same-sex marriages performed within Mexico are recognized by the 31 states without exception.
On 21 December 2009, the Federal District 's Legislative Assembly legalized same-sex marriages and adoption by same-sex couples . The law was enacted eight days later and became effective in early March 2010. [208] On 10 August 2010, the Mexican Supreme Court ruled that while not every state must grant same-sex marriages, they must all recognize those performed where they are legal. [209]
On 28 November 2011, the first two same-sex marriages occurred in Quintana Roo after it was discovered that Quintana Roo's Civil Code did not explicitly prohibit same-sex marriage, [210] but these marriages were later annulled by the Governor of Quintana Roo in April 2012. [211] In May 2012, the Secretary of State of Quintana Roo reversed the annulments and allowed for future same-sex marriages to be performed in the state. [212]
On 11 February 2014, the Congress of Coahuila approved adoptions by same-sex couples and a bill legalizing same-sex marriages passed on 1 September 2014 making Coahuila the second state to reform its Civil Code to allow for legal same-sex marriages. [213] It took effect on 17 September, and the first couple married on 20 September. [214]
On 12 June 2015, the Governor of Chihuahua announced that his administration would no longer oppose same-sex marriages within the state. The order was effective immediately, thus making Chihuahua the third state to legalize such unions. [215] [216]
On 3 June 2015, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation released a "jurisprudential thesis" which deems the state-laws defining marriage as a union between a man and a woman unconstitutional. The ruling standardized court procedures across Mexico to authorize same-sex marriages. However, the process is still lengthy and more expensive than that for an opposite-sex marriage, as [129] the ruling did not invalidate any state laws, meaning gay couples will be denied the right to wed and will have to turn to the courts for individual injunctions. However, given the nature of the ruling, judges and courts throughout Mexico must approve any application for a same-sex marriage. [217] The official release of the thesis was on 19 June 2015, which took effect on 22 June 2015. [218]
On 25 June 2015, following the Supreme Court's ruling striking down district same-sex marriage bans, the Civil Registry of Guerrero announced that they had planned a collective same-sex marriage ceremony for 10 July 2015 and indicated that there would have to be a change to the law to allow gender-neutral marriage, passed through the state Legislature before the official commencement. [219] The registry announced more details of their plan, advising that only select registration offices in the state would be able to participate in the collective marriage event. [220] The state Governor instructed civil agencies to approve same-sex marriage licenses. On 10 July 2015, 20 same-sex couples were married by Governor Rogelio Ortega in Acapulco. [221] On 13 January 2016, the head of the Civil Registry of Acapulco announced that all marriages that took place on 10 July 2015 by the Governor and his wife were void and not legal as same-sex marriage is not legal in Guerrero, unless couples are granted amparo beforehand. [222] On 13 February 2016, however, the head of Guerrero's State Civil Registry department announced that same-sex couples could marry in any of the jurisdictions that want to marry the couples and criticised Acapulco's Civil Registry and other civil registries throughout the state for not allowing these kinds of weddings. [223]
On 17 December 2015, the Congress of Nayarit approved a bill legalizing same-sex marriage. [224] In January 2016, the Mexican Supreme Court declared Jalisco's Civil Code unconstitutional for limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples, effectively legalizing same-sex marriage in the state. [225] On 10 May 2016, the Congress of Campeche passed a same-sex marriage bill. [226] On 18 May 2016, both Michoacán and Morelos passed bills allowing for same-sex marriage to be legal. [227] [228] On 25 May 2016, a bill to legalize same-sex marriage in Colima was approved by the state Congress. [229]
On 17 May 2016, the President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto , signed an initiative to change the country's Constitution, which would legalize same-sex marriage throughout Mexico. [230] On 9 November 2016, the Committee on Constitutional Issues of the Chamber of Deputies rejected the initiative 19 votes to 8. [231]

Netherlands
The Netherlands was the first country to extend marriage laws to include same-sex couples, following the recommendation of a special commission appointed to investigate the issue in 1995. A same-sex marriage bill passed the House of Representatives and the Senate in 2000, taking effect on 1 April 2001. [232]
In the Dutch Caribbean special municipalities of Bonaire , Sint Eustatius and Saba , marriage is open to same-sex couples. A law enabling same-sex couples to marry in these municipalities passed and came into effect on 10 October 2012. [233] The Caribbean countries Aruba, Curaçao and Sint Maarten , forming the remainder of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, do not perform same-sex marriages, but must recognize those performed in the Netherlands proper.

New Zealand
On 14 May 2012, Labour Party MP Louisa Wall stated that she would introduce a private member's bill , the Marriage (Definition of Marriage) Amendment Bill , allowing same-sex couples to marry. [234] The bill was submitted to the members' bill ballot on 30 May 2012. [235] It was drawn from the ballot and passed the first and second readings on 29 August 2012 and 13 March 2013, respectively. [236] [237] The final reading passed on 17 April 2013 by 77 votes to 44. [238] [239] The bill received royal assent from the Governor-General on 19 April and took effect on 19 August 2013. [240] [241]
New Zealand marriage law only applies to New Zealand proper and the Ross Dependency in Antarctica. Other New Zealand territories, including Cook Islands , Niue and Tokelau , have their own marriage law and do not perform nor recognise same-sex marriage.

Norway
Same-sex marriage became legal in Norway on 1 January 2009 when a gender-neutral marriage bill was enacted after being passed by the Norwegian Parliament in June 2008. [242] [243] Norway became the first Scandinavian country and the sixth country in the world to legalize same-sex marriage.
Gender-neutral marriage replaced Norway's previous system of registered partnerships for same-sex couples. Couples in registered partnerships are able to retain that status or convert their registered partnership to a marriage. No new registered partnerships may be created.

Portugal
Portugal created de facto unions ( união de facto in legal European Portuguese) similar to common-law marriage for cohabiting opposite-sex partners in 1999, and extended these unions to same-sex couples in 2001. However, the 2001 extension did not allow for same-sex adoption, either jointly or of stepchildren. [244]
On 11 February 2010, Parliament approved a bill legalizing same-sex marriage. The Portuguese President promulgated the law on 8 April 2010 and the law was effective on 5 June 2010, making Portugal the eighth country to legalize nationwide same-sex marriage; however, adoption was still denied for same-sex couples. [245]
On 24 February 2012, Parliament rejected two bills allowing same-sex couples to adopt children. [246]
On 17 May 2013, the Portuguese Parliament approved a bill to recognise some adoption rights for same-sex couples in the first reading [247] [248] [249] A bill granting adoption rights to same-sex parents and carers, as well as in-vitro fertilisation for lesbian relationships, was introduced in Parliament by then opposition Socialist and Left Block parties on 16 January 2015. [250] On 22 January, Parliament rejected the proposals. [251]
Finally in December 2015, the Portuguese Parliament approved a bill to recognise adoptions rights for same-sex couples. [252] [253] [254] It came into effect in March 2016.

South Africa
Legal recognition of same-sex marriages in South Africa came about as a result of the Constitutional Court 's decision in the case of Minister of Home Affairs v Fourie . The court ruled on 1 December 2005 that the existing marriage laws violated the equality clause of the Bill of Rights because they discriminated on the basis of sexual orientation. The court gave Parliament one year to rectify the inequality. The Civil Union Act was passed by the National Assembly on 14 November 2006, by a vote of 230 to 41. It became law on 30 November 2006. South Africa is the fifth country, the first in Africa, and the second outside Europe, to legalize same-sex marriage.

Spain
Spain was the third country in the world to legalize same-sex marriage, which has been legal since 3 July 2005, and was supported by the majority of the Spanish people. [255] [256] In 2004, the nation's newly elected Socialist Government, led by President José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero , began a campaign for its legalization, including the right of adoption by same-sex couples . [257] After much debate, the law permitting same-sex marriage was passed by the Cortes Generales (Spain's bicameral Parliament ) on 30 June 2005. King Juan Carlos , who by law has up to 30 days to decide whether to grant royal assent to laws, indirectly showed his approval by signing it on 1 July 2005, the same day it reached his desk. The law was published on 2 July 2005. [258] In 2013, Pew Research Center declared Spain the most tolerant country of the world with homosexuality. [259] [260] However, the studies did not include the Benelux or the Scandinavian countries.

Sweden
Same-sex marriage in Sweden has been legal since 1 May 2009, following the adoption of a new, gender-neutral law on marriage by the Swedish Parliament on 1 April 2009, making Sweden the seventh country in the world to open marriage to same-sex couples nationwide. Marriage replaced Sweden's registered partnerships for same-sex couples. Existing registered partnerships between same-sex couples remained in force with an option to convert them into marriages. [261] [262]

United Kingdom
Since 2005, same-sex couples have been allowed to enter into civil partnerships , a separate union providing the legal consequences of marriage . In 2006, the High Court rejected a legal bid by a British lesbian couple who had married in Canada to have their union recognised as a marriage in the UK rather than a civil partnership. In September 2011, the Coalition Government announced its intention to introduce same-sex civil marriage in England and Wales by the May 2015 general election . [263] However, unlike the Scottish Government's consultation, the UK Government's consultation for England and Wales did not include provision for religious ceremonies. In May 2012, three religious groups (Quakers, Liberal Judaism and Unitarians) sent a letter to David Cameron, asking that they be allowed to solemnise same-sex weddings. [264]
In June 2012, the UK Government completed the consultation to allow civil marriage for same-sex couples in England and Wales . [265] In its response to the consultation, the Government said that it also intended "...to enable those religious organisations that wish to conduct same-sex marriage ceremonies to do so, on a permissive basis only." [266] In December 2012, the Prime Minister, David Cameron, announced that, whilst he favoured allowing same-sex marriage within a religious context, provision would be made guaranteeing no religious institution would be required to perform such ceremonies. [267] On 5 February 2013, the House of Commons debated the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill , approving it in a 400–175 vote at the second reading . [268] The third reading took place on 21 May 2013, and was approved by 366 votes to 161. [269] On 4 June 2013, the bill received its second reading in the House of Lords , after a blocking amendment was defeated by 390 votes to 148. [270] On 15 July 2013, the bill was given a third reading by the House of Lords, meaning that it had been passed, and so it was then returned to Commons for the consideration of the Lords' amendments. On 16 July 2013, the Commons accepted all of the Lords' amendments. [271] On 17 July 2013, the bill received royal assent becoming the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013 . [271] The first same-sex marriages took place on 29 March 2014. [272]
The Scottish Government conducted a three-month-long consultation which ended on 9 December 2011 and the analysis was published in July 2012. [273] Unlike the consultation held in England and Wales, Scotland considered both civil and religious same-sex marriage. Whilst the Scottish Government is in favour of same-sex marriage, it stated that no religious body would be forced to hold such ceremonies once legislation is enacted. [274] The Scottish consultation received more than 77,000 responses, and on 27 June 2013 the Government published the bill. [275] In order to preserve the freedom of both religious groups and individual clergy, the Scottish Government believed it necessary for changes to be made to the Equality Act 2010 and communicated with the UK Government on this matter; thus, the first same-sex marriages in Scotland did not occur until this had taken place. [276] Although the Scottish bill concerning same-sex marriage had been published, the 'Australian' reported that LGBT rights campaigners, celebrating outside the UK Parliament on 15 July 2013 for the clearance of the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill in the House of Lords, declared that they would continue the campaign to extend same-sex marriage rights to both Scotland and Northern Ireland, [277] rather than solely Northern Ireland, where there are no plans to introduce such legislation. On 4 February 2014, the Scottish Parliament overwhelmingly passed legislation legalising same-sex marriage. [278] The bill received royal assent as the Marriage and Civil Partnership (Scotland) Act 2014 on 12 March 2014. [279] [280] The law took effect on 16 December 2014, with the first same-sex weddings occurring for those converting their civil partnerships into marriage. [281] [282] Malcolm Brown and Joe Schofield from Tullibody were scheduled to be the first to be declared husband and husband just after midnight on 31 December, following a Humanist ceremony, but they were superseded by couples marrying on 16 December. Nonetheless, Brown and Schofield were married on Hogmanay . [283]
The Northern Ireland Executive has stated that it does not intend to introduce legislation allowing for same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland. Same-sex marriages from other jurisdictions are treated as civil partnerships.
Of the fourteen British Overseas Territories , same-sex marriage has been legal in Akrotiri and Dhekelia and the British Indian Ocean Territory (for UK military personnel) since 3 June 2014, the Pitcairn Islands since 14 May 2015, the British Antarctic Territory since 13 October 2016, Gibraltar since 15 December 2016, Ascension Island since 1 January 2017, and Bermuda since 5 May 2017. Legislation allowing same-sex marriage in the Falkland Islands is currently awaiting royal assent . Of the three Crown dependencies , same-sex marriage has been legal in the Isle of Man since 22 July 2016 and in Guernsey since 2 May 2017.

United States
The movement to obtain civil marriage rights and benefits for same-sex couples in the United States began in the 1970s. [284] and in 1971 the United States Supreme Court dismissed a case, Baker v. Nelson claiming such right on appeal, establishing it as a precedent as it came from mandatory appellate review. The issue did not become prominent in U.S. politics until the 1993 Hawaii Supreme Court decision in Baehr v. Lewin that declared that state's prohibition to be unconstitutional. [285] During the 21st century, public support for same-sex marriage has grown considerably, [286] [287] and national polls conducted since 2011 show that a majority of Americans support legalizing it. On 17 May 2004, Massachusetts became the first U.S. state and the sixth jurisdiction in the world to legalize same-sex marriage following the Supreme Judicial Court 's decision in Goodridge v. Department of Public Health six months earlier. [288]
Before the legalization of same-sex marriage in any U.S. jurisdiction, the U.S. Congress passed the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) in 1996, attempting to define marriage for the first time solely as a union between a man and a woman for all federal purposes, and allowing states to refuse to recognize such marriages created in other states. [289]
President Barack Obama announced on 9 May 2012, that "I think same-sex couples should be able to get married". [290] [291] [292] Obama also supported the full repeal of DOMA , [293] and called the state constitutional bans on same-sex marriage in California (2008) [294] and North Carolina (2012) unnecessary. [295] In 2011, the Obama Administration concluded that DOMA was unconstitutional and directed the U.S. Justice Department (DOJ) to stop defending the law in court. [296] Subsequently, Eric Cantor , Republican majority leader in the U.S. House of Representatives , announced that the House would defend DOMA. The law firm hired to represent the House soon withdrew from defending the law, requiring the House to retain replacement counsel. [297] In the past two decades, public support for same-sex marriage has steadily increased, [55] and polls indicate that more than half of Americans support same-sex marriage. [55] [298] [299] Voters in Maine , Maryland and Washington approved same-sex marriage by referendum on 6 November 2012. [300]
On 26 June 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in United States v. Windsor Section 3 of DOMA was unconstitutional for allowing the federal government of the United States to deny federal recognition of same-sex marriage licenses, if it is recognized or performed in a state that allows same-sex marriage. [301] Two years later on the same day, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Obergefell v. Hodges that state level bans on same-sex marriage to be unconstitutional as well, legalizing same-sex marriage throughout the entire U.S. proper and all incorporated territories. [302]
On 6 October 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court denied review of five writ petitions from decisions of appellate courts finding constitutional right to same-sex marriage. [303] The immediate effect was to increase to 25 the number of states allowing same-sex marriage. [304]
On 26 June 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5–4 in Obergefell v. Hodges that states cannot prohibit the issuing of marriage licenses to same-sex couples, or to deny recognition of lawfully performed out-of-state marriage licenses to same-sex couples. This ruling invalidated same-sex marriage bans in any U.S. State and certain territories. [305] [306] Prior to this ruling, same-sex marriages were legally performed in 37 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, Guam as well as some Native American tribes. [307] [308] [309]
Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg officiated at a same-sex wedding during the 2013 Labor Day weekend in what is believed to be a first for a member of the Supreme Court. [310] [311]
A poll conducted in 2014 showed 59% of the American people supporting legal recognition for same-sex marriage. [312] This increased to 60% in 2015, and 61% in 2016: a record high. [313]

Uruguay
Uruguay's Chamber of Deputies passed a bill on 12 December 2012, to extend marriage rights to same-sex couples. [314] The Senate passed the bill on 2 April 2013, but with minor amendments. On 10 April 2013, the Chamber of Deputies passed the amended bill by a two-thirds majority (71–22). The president promulgated the law on 3 May 2013 and it took effect on 5 August. [315]

National debates

Andorra
On 31 March 2014, the Social Democratic Party introduced a bill to legalize same-sex marriage. [316] [317] On 29 May 2014, the bill was rejected by Parliament. [318] [319]

Australia
Australian federal law currently bans recognition of same-sex marriages. Civil unions/partnerships are available in the Australian Capital Territory and Queensland , while domestic registered partnerships are available in New South Wales , Victoria , Tasmania and South Australia . Western Australia and the Northern Territory both only offer de facto unions for same-sex couples, and committed same-sex couples in all states and territories are recognised as de facto unions (which provide most of the benefits and recognition of marriage) under federal law.
On 22 October 2013, a bill was passed by the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) legalising same-sex marriage in the ACT. However, the High Court found that the change was never valid and an official reversal of the bill was announced on 12 December 2013. The High Court established that such a change to ACT legislation could not operate concurrently with the federal Marriage Act. [320]
As of September 2016, 21 same-sex marriage related bills have been introduced in the Parliament of Australia , none of which have passed and become law. The Coalition Government , narrowly re-elected at the July 2016 federal election , pledged to hold a plebiscite on the issue in early 2017, with the question being put to the Australian people, rather than being resolved by the parliament. The opposition Labor Party supports same-sex marriage but lobbies for a parliamentary conscience vote on same-sex marriage legislation. This resulted in the two parties coming to loggerheads and with the Labor party refusing to back a plebiscite, and Coalition refusing to allow a parliamentary conscience vote, thus resulting in a stalemate on the issue for the time being. [321]

Austria
On 20 November 2013, the Greens introduced a bill in Parliament that would legalise same-sex marriage. [322] It was sent to the Judiciary Committee on 17 December 2013. [323] The bill was supposed to be debated in Autumn 2014, [324] but was delayed by the ruling coalition.
In December 2015, the Vienna Administrative Court dismissed a case challenging the same-sex marriage ban. The plaintiffs appealed to the Constitutional Court. [325]

Chile
Michelle Bachelet , the President of Chile, who was elected to a second term in March 2014, has promised to work for the implementation of same-sex marriage and has a majority in both houses of Congress . Previously, she said, "Marriage equality, I believe we have to make it happen." [326] Polling shows majority support for same-sex marriage among Chileans. [327]
On 10 December 2014, a group of senators , from various parties, joined LGBT rights group MOVILH (Homosexual Movement of Integration and Liberation) in presenting a bill to allow same-sex marriage and adoption to Congress. MOVILH has been in talks with the Chilean Government to seek an amiable solution to the pending marriage lawsuit brought against the state before the Inter-American Court of Human Rights . MOVILH has suggested that they would drop the case if Bachelet's Congress keeps their promise to legislate same-sex marriage. [328] President Bachelet stated before a United Nations General Assembly panel in September 2016 that the Chilean Government would submit a same-sex marriage bill to Congress in the first half of 2017. [329]
Meanwhile, on 28 January 2015, the National Congress approved a bill recognizing civil unions for same-sex and opposite-sex couples offering some of the rights of marriage. Bachelet signed the bill on 14 April, and it came into effect on 22 October. [330] [331]
A poll carried out during September 2015 by the pollster Cadem Plaza Pública found that 60% of Chileans support same-sex marriage, whilst 36% are against it. [332]

China
The Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China explicitly defines marriage as the union between one man and one woman. No other form of civil union is recognized. The attitude of the Chinese Government towards homosexuality is believed to be "three nos": "No approval; no disapproval; no promotion." The Ministry of Health officially removed homosexuality from its list of mental illnesses in 2001.
Li Yinhe , a sociologist and sexologist well known in the Chinese gay community, has tried to legalize same-sex marriage several times, including during the National People's Congress in 2000 and 2004 ( Legalization for Same-Sex Marriage 《中国同性婚姻合法化》 in 2000 and the Same-Sex Marriage Bill 《中国同性婚姻提案》 in 2004). According to Chinese law, 35 delegates' signatures are needed to make an issue a bill to be discussed in the Congress. Her efforts failed due to lack of support from the delegates. CPPCC National Committee spokesman Wu Jianmin when asked about Li Yinhe's proposal, said that same-sex marriage was still too "ahead of its time" for China. He argued that same-sex marriage was not recognized even in many Western countries, which are considered much more liberal in social issues than China. [333] This statement is understood as an implication that the Government may consider recognition of same-sex marriage in the long run, but not in the near future.
On 5 January 2016, a court in Changsha , southern Hunan Province , agreed to hear the lawsuit of 26-year-old Sun Wenlin filed in December 2015 against the Bureau of Civil Affairs of Furong District for its June 2015 refusal to let him marry his 36-year-old male partner, Hu Mingliang. On 13 April 2016, with hundreds of same-sex marriage supporters outside, the Changsha court ruled against Sun, who vowed to appeal, citing the importance of his case for LGBT progress in China. [334]

Costa Rica
On 19 March 2015, a bill to legalize same-sex marriage was introduced to the Legislative Assembly by Deputy Ligia Elena Fallas Rodríguez from the Broad Front . [335] On 10 December 2015, the organization Front for Equal Rights ( Frente Por los Derechos Igualitarios ) and a group of deputies presented another bill. [336] [337] [338]
On 10 February 2016, the Constitutional Court of Costa Rica announced it would hear a case seeking to legalize same-sex marriage in Costa Rica and declare the country's same-sex marriage ban unconstitutional. [339]

Ecuador
On 13 August 2013, a same-sex couple filed a lawsuit before the Supreme Court of Ecuador asking that the country's same-sex marriage ban be declared unconstitutional. [340]

El Salvador
In August 2016, a lawyer in El Salvador filed a lawsuit before the country's Supreme Court asking for the nullification of Article 11 of the Family Code which defines marriage as a heterosexual union. Labeling the law as discriminatory and explaining the lack of gendered terms used in Article 34 of the Constitution’s summary of a marriage, the lawsuit seeks to allow same-sex couples the right to wed. [341] A second lawsuit was filed in November.

Estonia
In October 2014, the Estonian Parliament approved a civil union law open to both opposite-sex and same-sex couples. [342]
In December 2016, the Tallinn Circuit Court ruled that same-sex marriages concluded in another country must be recognised as such in Estonia. [343]

Georgia
In 2016, a man filed a challenge against Georgia's same-sex marriage ban, arguing that while the Civil Code of Georgia states that marriage is explicitly between a man and a woman; the Constitution does not reference gender in its section on marriage. [344]

Germany
Since 1 August 2001, Germany has registered partnerships ( Eingetragene Lebenspartnerschaft ) for same-sex couples, providing most but not all rights of marriage. In 2004, this act was amended to include adoption rights (stepchild adoption only) and to reform previously cumbersome dissolution procedures with regard to division of property and alimony. Attempts to give equal rights to registered partners or to legalize same-sex marriage have generally been blocked by the CDU/CSU , the main party in government since 2005. All other main parties ( SPD , The Greens , The Left and FDP ) support full LGBT equality. The Federal Constitutional Court of Germany has issued various rulings in favor of equal rights for same-sex registered partners (such as joint tax filing benefits), requiring the governing coalition to change the law.

India
Same-sex marriage is not explicitly prohibited under Indian law and at least one couple has had their marriage recognised by the courts. [345] In April 2014, Medha Patkar of the Aam Aadmi Party stated that her party supports the legalisation of same-sex marriage. [346]

Israel
Israel's High Court of Justice ruled to recognize foreign same-sex marriages for the limited purpose of registration with the Administration of Border Crossings, Population and Immigration, however this is merely for statistical purposes and grants no state-level rights; Israel does not recognize civil marriages performed under its own jurisdiction. A bill was raised in the Knesset (parliament) to rescind the High Court's ruling, but the Knesset has not advanced the bill since December 2006. A bill to legalize same-sex and interfaith civil marriages was defeated in the Knesset, 39–11, on 16 May 2012. [347]
In November 2015, the National LGBT Taskforce of Israel petitioned the Supreme Court of Israel to allow same-sex marriage in the country, arguing that the refusal of the rabbinical court to recognise same-sex marriage should not prevent civil courts from performing same-sex marriages. The court did not immediately rule against the validity of the petition. [348]

Italy
On 9 April 2014, the Civil Court of Grosseto ordered that a same-sex marriage contracted abroad be recognised in the municipality. [349]
The cities of Bologna , Naples and Fano began recognizing same-sex marriages from other jurisdictions in July 2014, [350] [351] followed by Empoli , Pordenone , Udine and Trieste in September, [352] [353] [354] and Florence , Piombino , Milan and Rome in October, [355] [356] and by Bagheria in November. [357] Other cities that are considering similar laws include Cagliari, Livorno, Syracuse, Pompei and Treviso. [358]
A January 2013 Datamonitor poll found that 54.1% of respondents were in favour of same-sex marriage. [359] A May 2013 Ipsos poll found that 42% of Italians supported allowing same-sex couples to marry and adopt children. [360] An October 2014 Demos poll found that 55% of respondents were in favour of same-sex marriage, with 42% against. [361]
On 25 February 2016, the Italian Senate passed a bill allowing civil unions with 173 senators in favour and 73 against. That same bill was approved by the Chamber of Deputies on 11 May 2016 with 372 deputies in favour and 51 against. [362] The President of Italy signed the bill into law on 22 May 2016 and the law went into effect on 5 June 2016.

Japan
Same-sex marriage is not legal in Japan. Article 24 of the Japanese Constitution states that "Marriage shall be based only on the mutual consent of both sexes and it shall be maintained through mutual cooperation with the equal rights of husband and wife as a basis." [363] Article 24 was created to establish the equality of both sexes in marriage, in opposition to the pre-war legal situation whereby the husband/father was legally defined as the head of household and marriage require permission from the male head of the family. The wording, however, inadvertently defined marriage as the union of man and woman.
51% of the Japanese population supports same-sex marriage, according to the latest poll carried out in 2015. [364]

Latvia
On 27 May 2016, the Constitutional Court of Latvia overturned an administrative court decision which refused an application to register a same-sex marriage in the country. A Supreme Court press spokeswoman said that the court agrees with the administrative court that current regulations do not allow for same-sex marriages to be legally performed in Latvia. However, the matter should have been considered in a context not of marriage, but of registering familial partnership. Furthermore, it would have been impossible to conclude whether the applicants' rights were violated or not unless their claim is accepted and reviewed in a proper manner. [365] The Supreme Court will now decide whether the refusal was in breach of the Latvian Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights.

Malta
Malta has recognized same-sex unions since April 2014, following the enactment of the Civil Unions Bill, first introduced in September 2013. It established civil unions with same rights, responsibilities, and obligations as marriage, including the right of joint adoption and recognition of foreign same sex marriage. [366] Parliament gave final approval to the legislation on 14 April 2014 by a vote of 37 in favour and 30 abstentions. President Marie Louise Coleiro Preca signed it into law on 16 April. The first foreign same sex marriage was registered on 29 April 2014 and the first civil union was performed on 14 June 2014. [366]
On 21 February 2017, the Minister for Social Dialogue, Consumer Affairs and Civil Liberties Helena Dalli said that she is preparing a bill to legalise same-sex marriage. [367]

Nepal
In November 2008, the Supreme Court of Nepal issued final judgment on matters related to LGBT rights, which included permitting same-sex couples to marry. Same-sex marriage and protection for sexual minorities were to be included in the new Nepalese Constitution required to be completed by 31 May 2012. [368] [369] However, the Legislature was unable to agree on the Constitution before the deadline and was dissolved after the Supreme Court ruled that the term could not be extended. [370]
In October 2016, the Ministry of Women, Children and Social Welfare constituted a committee for the purpose of preparing a draft bill to legalize same-sex marriage. [371]

Panama
On 17 October 2016, a married same-sex couple filed an action of unconstitutionality seeking to recognise same-sex marriages performed abroad. [372] In early November, the case was admitted to the Supreme Court. [373] A challenge seeking to legalize same-sex marriage in Panama was introduced before the Supreme Court in March 2017. [374]

Peru
In a ruling published on 9 January 2017, the 7th Constitutional Court of Lima ordered the RENIEC to recognize and register the marriage of a same-sex couple who had previously wed in Mexico City . [375] [376] RENIEC later appealed the ruling.
On 14 February 2017, a bill legalizing same-sex marriage was introduced in the Peruvian Congress. [377]

Philippines
Same-sex marriages and civil unions are currently not recognized by the state, the illegal insurgent Communist Party of the Philippines performs same-sex marriages in territories under its control since 2005. [378]
In October 2016, Speaker of the House of Representatives of the Philippines Pantaleon Alvarez announced he will file a civil union bill in Congress . [379]

Poland
In Poland, the national debate regarding recognition of same-sex marriage is conducted along the debate about civil partnerships. [380] [381] In a 2013 opinion poll conducted by CBOS , 72% of Poles were against same-sex marriage. [382]

Romania
As of October 2016, a lawsuit initiated by a Romanian man seeking to have his marriage to an American man recognised is ongoing. The Constitutional Court is hearing the case and is consulting with the European Court of Justice on the matter, with a hearing in the case set for late March 2017. [383]

Slovenia
Slovenia recognises registered partnerships for same-sex couples.
In December 2014, the eco-socialist United Left party introduced a bill amending expansion of the definition of marriage in the 1976 Marriage and Family Relations Act to include same-sex couples. In January 2015, the Government expressed no opposition to the bill. In February 2015, the bill was passed with 11 votes to 2. In March, the Assembly passed the bill in a 51–28 vote. On 10 March 2015, the National Council rejected a motion to require the Assembly to vote on the bill again, in a 14–23 vote. Opponents of the bill launched a petition for a referendum and managed to collect 40,000 signatures. Then Parliament voted to block the referendum with a clarification that it would be against the Slovenian Constitution to vote about matters concerning human rights. Finally the Constitutional Court ruled against the banning of the referendum (5–4) and the referendum was to be held on 20 December 2015.
In the referendum, 63.4% of the voters voted against the law, rendering Parliament's same-sex marriage act invalid. [384]

South Korea
In July 2015, Kim Jho Kwang-soo and his partner, Kim Seung-Hwan, filed a lawsuit seeking legal status for their marriage after their marriage registration form was rejected by the local authorities in Seoul . On 25 May 2016, a South Korean district court ruled against the couple and argued that without clear legislation a same-sex union can not be recognized as a marriage. [385] The couple quickly filed an appeal against the district court ruling. Their lawyer, Ryu Min-Hee, announced that two more same-sex couples had filed separate lawsuits in order to be allowed to wed. [386] In December 2016, a South Korean appeals court upheld the district court ruling. The couple vowed to bring the case to the Supreme Court of South Korea . [387]

Switzerland
A same-sex marriage bill is pending in Parliament after the Green Liberal Party of Switzerland , [388] introduced a constitutional initiative to legalize same-sex marriage in December 2013, in opposotion to a Christian Democrat initiative banning same-sex marriage. The Committee for Legal Affairs of the National Council approved the Green Liberal initiative by 12-9 and 1 abstention on 20 February 2015. [389] On 1 September 2015, the upper house's Legal Affairs Committee voted 7 to 5 to proceed with the initiative. [390] The National Council's Legal Affairs Committee can now draft an act.
In a poll in June 2013 for ifop , 63% approved same-sex marriage. [391] After the National Council 's Committee of Law Affairs' decision to approve same-sex marriage, two opinion polls released on 22 February 2015 showed a support of 54% ( Léger Marketing for Blick [392] ) and 71% (GfS Zürich for SonntagsZeitung [393] ) allowing same-sex couples to marry and adopt children. Additionally, in November 2016, voters in the canton of Zürich overwhelmingly rejected an initiative seeking to ban same-sex marriage in the cantonal Constitution, with 81% voting against. [394]
In March 2015, the Swiss Federal Council released a governmental report about marriage and new rights for families. It opens the possibility to introduce registered partnerships for different-sex couples as well as same-sex marriage for same-sex couples. [395] The Swiss President Simonetta Sommaruga in charge of the Federal Department of Justice and Police also stated she hoped personally that same-sex couples would soon be allowed to marry. [396]
The Christian Democratic People's Party of Switzerland (CVP/PDC) started in 2011 with gathering signatures for a popular initiative entitled "For the couple and the family - No to the penalty of marriage". This initiative would change article 14 of the Swiss Federal Constitution and aimed to put equal fiscal rights and equal social security benefits between married couples and unmarried cohabiting couples. However, the text aimed to introduce as well in the Constitution for the first time ever the definition of marriage, which would be the sole "union between a man and a woman". [397] On 19 June 2015, the Parliament recommended that voters reject the initiative. [398] The Federal Council also recommended rejecting the initiative. [399] [400] The Swiss people voted on the Christian Democrats' proposal in a referendum on 28 February 2016 [401] and rejected it by 50.8% of the votes. [402]

Taiwan
On 22 December 2014, a proposed amendment to the Civil Code which would legalize same-sex marriage was due to go under review by the Judiciary Committee. If the amendment passes the committee stage it will then be voted on at the plenary session of the Legislative Yuan in 2015. The amendment, called the marriage equality amendment, would insert neutral terms into the Civil Code replacing ones that imply heterosexual marriage, effectively legalizing same-sex marriage. It would also allow same-sex couples to adopt children. Yu Mei-nu of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), who is the convener of the current legislative session, has expressed support for the amendment as have more than 20 other DPP lawmakers as well as two from the Taiwan Solidarity Union and one each from the Kuomintang and the People First Party . [403] Taiwan would become the first country in Asia to legalize same-sex marriage if the Civil Code is amended.
A poll carried out between August and October 2015 found that 71% of the Taiwanese population supports same-sex marriage. [404] Tsai Ing-wen , the President of Taiwan since May 2016, announced her support of same-sex marriage in November 2015. [405] In October 2016, two same-sex marriage bills were introduced before the Legislative Yuan . Subsequently, protests have been staged by groups opposing and by groups supporting legalization. [406] [407] On 24 May 2017, the Constitutional Court ruled that same-sex couples have the right to marry, and gave the government two years to amend the law to that effect. If the law is not amended after two years, same-sex couples will be able to register a valid marriage application in Taiwan. [408]

Thailand
A same-sex-marriage bill before the Thai Parliament has bipartisan support, but as of April 2014 has been stalled due to the political crisis in the country. [409] In the second half of 2014, reports emerged that a draft bill called the Civil Partnership Act will be submitted to the junta-appointed Thai Parliament. [410]

Turkey
In the process of rewriting the Turkish Constitution, the opposition party BDP called for the liberalization of marriage policies to include same-sex marriage. The largest opposition party in the Turkish Parliament, CHP , supported the idea. The largest party in parliament, the AKP , opposes same-sex marriage, although Premier Recep Tayyip Erdoğan , the leader of the AKP, supported full equal rights for LGBT citizens in 2002, the year he launched his party. In response to a request from BDP, a parliamentary discussion of same-sex marriage is anticipated when all political parties gather in committees to establish a new constitution. [411] [412] In 2013, a poll of Turkish attitudes towards sexuality, 3.6% of Turks supported same-sex marriages. [413] In 2015, research revealed that 80% of the Turkish population is against same-sex marriage. [414]

Venezuela
In April 2016, the Supreme Court announced it would hear a lawsuit which seeks to declare Article 44 of the Civil Code unconstitutional for outlawing same-sex marriage. [415]

Vietnam
In Vietnam, currently only a marriage between a man and a woman is recognized. Vietnam's Ministry of Justice began seeking advice on legalizing same-sex marriage from other governmental and non-governmental organizations in April and May 2012, and planned to further discuss the issue at the National Assembly in Spring 2013. [416] However, in February 2013, the Ministry of Justice requested that the National Assembly avoid action until 2014. [417] At a hearing to discuss marriage law reforms in April 2013, deputy minister of health Nguyen Viet Tien proposed that same-sex marriage be made legal immediately. [418]
The Vietnamese Government abolished an administrative fine imposed on same-sex weddings in 2013. [419] The policy was enacted on 11 November 2013. The 100,000–500,000 VND ($24 USD ) fine will be abolished. Although same-sex marriages are not permitted in Vietnam, the policy will decriminalize the relationship, habitual privileges such as household registry, property, child raising, and co-habitual partnerships are recognized. [420]
In June 2013, the National Assembly began formal debate on a proposal to establish legal recognition for same-sex marriage. [421] On 24 September 2013, the Government issued the decree abolishing the fines on same-sex marriages. The decree took effect on 11 November 2013. [422] [423] [424] On 27 May 2014, the National Assembly's Committee for Social Affairs removed the provision giving legal status and some rights to cohabiting same-sex couples from the Government's bill to amend the Law on Marriage and Family . [425] [426] The bill was approved by the National Assembly on 19 June 2014. [427] [428]
On 1 January 2015, the 2014 Law on Marriage and Family officially went into effect. It states that while Vietnam allows same-sex weddings, it will not offer legal recognition or protection to unions between people of the same sex. [429]

International organizations
The terms of employment of the staff of international organizations (not commercial ) in most cases are not governed by the laws of the country where their offices are located. Agreements with the host country safeguard these organizations' impartiality.
Despite their relative independence, few organizations recognize same-sex partnerships without condition. The agencies of the United Nations recognize same-sex marriages if and only if the country of citizenship of the employees in question recognizes the marriage. [430] In some cases, these organizations do offer a limited selection of the benefits normally provided to mixed-sex married couples to de facto partners or domestic partners of their staff, but even individuals who have entered into a mixed-sex civil union in their home country are not guaranteed full recognition of this union in all organizations. However, the World Bank does recognize domestic partners. [431]

Other arrangements

Civil unions
Civil union, civil partnership , domestic partnership , registered partnership , unregistered partnership, and unregistered cohabitation statuses offer varying legal benefits of marriage. As of March 2017, countries that have an alternative form of legal recognition other than marriage on a national level are: Andorra , Australia , Chile , Costa Rica , Croatia , Cyprus , Czech Republic , Ecuador , Estonia , Germany , Greece , Hungary , Israel , Italy , Japan (various cities) , Liechtenstein , Mexico (Tlaxcala) , the Netherlands (Aruba) , San Marino , Slovenia , Switzerland , Taiwan (all special municipalities and some counties and provincial cities) and the United Kingdom (Northern Ireland and Jersey ). [433] [434] Malta has established civil unions with the same rights and responsibilities as marriage, differing only in name. [435] [436] Additionally, thirteen countries which have legalized same-sex marriage still have an alternative form of legal recognition for same-sex couples, usually available to heterosexual couples as well: Argentina , Belgium , Brazil , Colombia , Finland , France , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , Portugal , South Africa , Spain , the United Kingdom and Uruguay . [437] [438] [439] [440]
They are also available in parts of the United States ( California , Hawaii , Illinois , New Jersey , Nevada , Oregon and Wisconsin ). [441] [442] In some countries with these legal recognitions, the actual benefits are minimal. Many people consider civil unions, even those that grant equal rights, inadequate because they create a separate status, and believe they should be replaced by gender-neutral marriage. [443]

Non-sexual same-sex marriage

Kenya
Female same-sex marriage is practiced among the Gikuyu , Nandi , Kamba , Kipsigis , and to a lesser extent neighboring peoples. Approximately 5–10% of women are in such marriages. However, this is not seen as homosexual, but is instead a way for families without sons to keep their inheritance within the family. [444] The laws criminalizing homosexuality are generally specific to men, though in 2010 the prime minister called for women to be arrested as well.

Nigeria
In Nigeria, homosexual activity between men, but not between women, is illegal. In 2006, Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo introduced legislation that prohibits same-sex marriages and criminalizes anyone who "performs, witnesses, aids or abets" such ceremonies. [445] Among the Igbo people and probably other peoples in the south of the country, there are circumstances where a marriage between women is considered appropriate, such as when a woman has no child and her husband dies, and she takes a wife to perpetuate her inheritance and family lineage. [446]

Issues
While few societies have recognized same-sex unions as marriages, the historical and anthropological record reveals a large range of attitudes towards same-sex unions ranging from praise, through full acceptance and integration, sympathetic toleration, indifference, prohibition and discrimination, to persecution and physical annihilation. Opponents of same-sex marriages have argued that same-sex marriage, while doing good for the couples that participate in them and the children they are raising, [447] undermines a right of children to be raised by their biological mother and father. [448] Some supporters of same-sex marriages take the view that the government should have no role in regulating personal relationships, [449] while others argue that same-sex marriages would provide social benefits to same-sex couples. [450] The debate regarding same-sex marriages includes debate based upon social viewpoints as well as debate based on majority rules, religious convictions, economic arguments, health-related concerns, and a variety of other issues.

Parenting
Scientific literature indicates that parents' financial, psychological and physical well-being is enhanced by marriage and that children benefit from being raised by two parents within a legally recognized union (either a mixed-sex or same-sex union). As a result, professional scientific associations have argued for same-sex marriage to be legally recognized as it will be beneficial to the children of same-sex parents or carers. [12] [13] [14] [451] [452] [453]
Scientific research has been generally consistent in showing that lesbian and gay parents are as fit and capable as heterosexual parents, and their children are as psychologically healthy and well-adjusted as children reared by heterosexual parents. [13] [453] [454] [455] According to scientific literature reviews, there is no evidence to the contrary. [50] [456] [457] [458]

Adoption
All states that allow same-sex marriage also allow the joint adoption of children by people of the same sex, with the exceptions of Guerrero, Jalisco, Nayarit and Quintana Roo in Mexico. In addition, Andorra , Austria , Israel and Malta as well as several subnational jurisdictions which do not recognize same-sex marriage nonetheless permit joint adoption by unmarried same-sex couples: the Australian Capital Territory, New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria and Western Australia in Australia, Veracruz in Mexico as well as Bermuda and Jersey in the United Kingdom. Some additional states allow stepchild adoption by those who are in a same-sex relationship but are unmarried: Croatia , Germany , Estonia , Slovenia and Switzerland .
More than 16,000 same-sex couples are raising an estimated 22,000 adopted children in the United States. [459] Same-sex couples are raising 4% of all adopted children in the United States. [460]

Surrogacy and IVF treatment
A gay or bisexual man has the option of surrogacy , the process in which a woman bears a child for another person through artificial insemination or carries another woman's surgically implanted fertilized egg to birth. A lesbian or bisexual woman has the option of artificial insemination. [461] [462]

Transgender and intersex people
When sex is defined legally, it may be defined by any one of several criteria: the XY sex-determination system , the type of gonads , the type of external sexual features, or the person's social identification. [ citation needed ] Consequently, both transgender and intersex individuals may be legally categorized into confusing gray areas, and could be prohibited from marrying partners of the "opposite" sex or permitted to marry partners of the "same" sex due to legal distinctions. [ citation needed ] This could result in long-term marriages, as well as recent same-sex marriages, being overturned. [ citation needed ]
The problems of defining gender by the existence/non-existence of gonads or certain sexual features is complicated by the existence of surgical methods to alter these features. [ citation needed ] Estimates run as high as one percent of live births exhibiting some degree of sexual ambiguity, [447] [463] and between 0.1% and 0.2% of live births being ambiguous enough to become the subject of specialist medical attention, including sometimes involuntary surgery to address their sexual ambiguity. [464]
In any legal jurisdiction where marriages are defined without distinction of a requirement of a male and female, these complications do not occur. In addition, some legal jurisdictions recognize a legal and official change of gender, which would allow a transgender male or female to be legally married in accordance with an adopted gender identity. [465]
In the United Kingdom, the Gender Recognition Act 2004 allows a person who has lived in their chosen gender for at least two years to receive a gender recognition certificate officially recognizing their new gender. Because in the United Kingdom marriages were until recently only for mixed-sex couples and civil partnerships are only for same-sex couples, a person must dissolve his/her civil partnership before obtaining a gender recognition certificate, and the same was formerly true for marriages in England and Wales, and still is in other territories. Such people are then free to enter or re-enter civil partnerships or marriages in accordance with their newly recognized gender identity. In Austria, a similar provision requiring transsexual people to divorce before having their legal sex marker corrected was found to be unconstitutional in 2006. [466]
In Quebec, prior to the legalization of same-sex marriage, only unmarried people could apply for legal change of gender. With the advent of same-sex marriage, this restriction was dropped. A similar provision including sterilization also existed in Sweden, but was phased out in 2013.
In the United States, transgender and intersex marriages typically run into similar complications. [ citation needed ] As definitions and enforcement of marriage are defined by the states, these complications vary from state to state, [467] as some of them prohibit legal changes of gender. [ citation needed ]

Divorce
In the United States of America before the case of Obergefell v. Hodges , couples in same-sex marriages could only obtain a divorce in jurisdictions that recognized same-sex marriages, with some exceptions. [468]

Judicial and legislative
There are differing positions regarding the manner in which same-sex marriage has been introduced into democratic jurisdictions. A " majority rules " position holds that same-sex marriage is valid, or void and illegal, based upon whether it has been accepted by a simple majority of voters or of their elected representatives. [469] In contrast, a civil rights view holds that the institution can be validly created through the ruling of an impartial judiciary carefully examining the questioning and finding that the right to marry regardless of the gender of the participants is guaranteed under the civil rights laws of the jurisdiction. [470]

Opposition

Religious views
Religion plays a prominent role in discourse about same-sex marriage, [ citation needed ] and several religious organizations and churches have expressed a range of official positions. Religious views on same-sex marriage are closely related to religious views on homosexuality. [ citation needed ] While the majority of world religions stand in opposition, the number of denominations accepting and conducting same-sex marriages has increased in the 2000s and 2010s. [ citation needed ]
Among Christians , the Roman Catholic Church , [471] Eastern Orthodox Church , [472] and various Protestant denominations, such as Seventh-day Adventists , take official positions opposing same-sex marriage. [473] The Jehovah's Witnesses are also officially opposed to same-sex marriage. [474] Some Protestant groups, like the Episcopal Church , the Presbyterian Church (USA) , and the United Church of Christ , and some Catholic ones, such as the Old Catholic Church (US Province), support allowing those of the same sex to marry or conduct same-sex marriage ceremonies. [475] [476] [477] Some individual churches have committed to marriage equality in opposition to their denominations' stances. [478] [479] [480] In 2016, a survey found that 64% of white mainline Protestants in the United States favor allowing gays and lesbians to legally wed. [481]
The vast majority of traditional Muslim scholars believe Shariah law opposes same-sex marriage and condemns same-sex sex. This is also the dominant view in modern Muslim societies, though, historically and culturally, same-sex sex often has been and is engaged in or celebrated. Some Muslims in the West now argue that homosexuality is allowed by Shariah law. [482] Most Orthodox Jewish leaders oppose same-sex marriage, while Conservative, Reform, and Reconstructionist Jewish rabbinical groups affirm its validity. [483] Though Buddhism is considered to be ambivalent on the subject as a whole, [484] [ not in citation given ] particular Buddhists have supported marriage equality, [485] [486] [487] as do a variety of other religious traditions. [488]

Religious freedom
One source of controversy is whether same-sex marriage affects freedom of religion . [489] [490] [491] [492] [493] Some religious organizations may refuse to provide employment, public accommodations, adoption services, and other benefits to same-sex couples. [494] Some jurisdictions include religion accommodation provisions in marriage equality laws. [495]
Following the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in the case of Obergefell v. Hodges in June 2015, Justice Kim Davis , who morally objects to same-sex marriage, had six lawsuits filed against her. Leading Americans, including politician Ted Cruz , expressed support for Kim Davis. [496]

Reddit
Reddit (stylized as reddit , / ˈ r ɛ d ɪ t / ) [5] is an American social news aggregation , web content rating , and discussion website. Reddit's registered community members can submit content such as text posts or direct links. Registered users can then vote submissions up or down that determines their position on the page. Submissions with the most up-votes appear on the front page or the top of a category. Content entries are organized by areas of interest called "subreddits". Subreddit topics include news, science, gaming, movies, music, books, fitness, food, image-sharing, and many others. The site prohibits harassment, and moderation requires substantial resources. [6]
As of 2017, Reddit had 542 million monthly visitors (234 million unique users), ranking #4 most visited web-site in US and #9 in the world. [7] Across 2015, Reddit saw 82.54 billion pageviews, 73.15 million submissions, 725.85 million comments, and 6.89 billion upvotes from its users. [8]
Reddit was founded by University of Virginia roommates Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian in 2005. Condé Nast Publications acquired the site in October 2006. Reddit became a direct subsidiary of Condé Nast's parent company, Advance Publications , in September 2011. As of August 2012, Reddit operates as an independent entity, although Advance is still its largest shareholder. [9] Reddit is based in San Francisco, California. In October 2014, Reddit raised $50 million in a funding round led by Sam Altman and including investors Marc Andreessen , Peter Thiel , Ron Conway , Snoop Dogg , and Jared Leto . [10] Their investment saw the company valued at $500 million. [11] [12]

Description

Site
The site is a collection of entries submitted by its registered users, essentially a bulletin board system . The name "Reddit" is a play-on-words with the phrase "read it", i.e., "I read it on Reddit." [13] The site's content is divided into numerous categories, and 49 such categories, or "default subreddits", are visible on the front page to new users and those who browse the site without logging into an account. As of May 2016 [update] , these include: [14]
When items (links or text posts) are submitted to a subreddit, the users, called " redditors ", [18] can vote for or against them (upvote/downvote). Each subreddit has a front page that shows newer submissions that have been rated highly. Redditors can also post comments about the submission, and respond back and forth in a conversation-tree of comments; the comments themselves can also be upvoted and downvoted. The front page of the site itself shows a combination of the highest-rated posts out of all the subreddits a user is subscribed to.
Front-page rank – for both the general front page and for individual subreddits – is determined by the age of the submission, positive ("upvoted") to negative ("downvoted") feedback ratio and the total vote-count. [19] Dozens of submissions cycle through these front pages daily.
The site's logo and its mascot is a line drawing of an alien nicknamed "Snoo". Subreddits often use themed variants of Snoo relevant to the subject. [20]
Although most of the site functions like a bulletin board or message board , each subreddit has the option of having an associated wiki that can provide supplementary material like instructions, recommended reading, or collaboration for real-life events.

Users
Registering an account with Reddit is free and does not require an email address to complete. As of June 2015, there were 36 million user accounts. [21] When logged in, Reddit users (known as redditors) have the ability to vote on submissions and comments to increase or decrease their visibility and submit links and comments. Users can also create their own subreddit on a topic of their choosing, and interested users can add it to their frontpage by subscribing to it. For example, as of May 2015 [update] , the Wikipedia subreddit – subtitled "the most interesting pages on Wikipedia" – has over 151,000 subscribers. [22] Reddit comments and submissions are occasionally abbreviated and peppered with terms that are understood within (and in many cases also outside) the Reddit community, ranging from OP (for "original poster" – the user who posted the submission being commented upon) to NSFW (for "not safe for work" – indicating the post has graphic or sexually explicit content). [23] Users earn "post karma" and "comment karma" for submitting text posts, link posts, and comments, which accumulate as point values on their user profile. "Post karma" refers to karma points received from text and link posts, while "comment karma" refers to karma points received from comments. Users may also be gifted "Reddit gold" if another user has well received the comment or post, generally due to humorous or high-quality content; this process is known as "gilding." Reddit has also created a system of points called "creddits". Reddit gold "creddits" are like gift certificates: each creddit you have allows you to give one month of Reddit gold to someone else. The points do not lead to a prize as they are meant to stand in as a badge of honor for the user among their peers, although redditors have attempted to redeem their points before. [24]
Reddit also allows submissions that do not link externally. These are called "self posts" or "text submissions". Many discussion-based subreddits allow only text-only submissions such as "AskReddit" – where users are only allowed to pose broad, discussion based questions to the community at large. Self posts previously did not accumulate karma points for the submitter, but as of July, 2016, these text-only posts generate karma. [25]
Reddit communities occasionally coordinate Reddit-external projects such as skewing polls on other websites, such as in 2007 when Greenpeace allowed web users to decide the name of a humpback whale it was tracking. Reddit users voted en masse to name the whale "Mr. Splashy Pants", and Reddit administrators further encouraged this by changing the site logo to a whale during the voting. In December of that year, Mister Splashy Pants was announced as the winner of the competition. [26]
Within the site, redditors commemorate their "cake day" once a year, which is the anniversary of the day the user's account was first created. The "cake day" offers no special benefit, except that a small icon representing a slice of cake appears next to that user's name for 24 hours. [27] Redditors can "friend" one another, which gives a redditor quick access to posting and comments of their friend list. The commenting system and friend system, along with a certain "Reddit ethos" (called reddiquette on Reddit), lend Reddit aspects of a social networking service , though not to the extent of Facebook , Google+ , and other websites aimed at providing social networking services. The Reddit community also socializes at meetups held at local parks and bars around the world, [28] and many localized subreddits for local in-person meetings exist.

Subreddits
Reddit entries are organized into areas of interest called "subreddits". Originally, the front page was the "main-reddit", and other areas were "subreddits". There is now no longer a single main-reddit. Instead, there are now 50 "default subreddits" dealing with topics such as books, television, and music, and thousands of additional non-default subreddits. The default subreddits are the 50 subreddits which are first recommended to new users to select from to appear on, or via their customizable top menu bars. All new users are initially automatically "subscribed to" the 50 default subreddits, but can then customize their "subscriptions."
Any registered user who has maintained an account for 31 days or more may create a non-default subreddit. [29] There are over 11,400 active total subreddits to peruse, [15] [16] [17] including the default set of 50 subreddits as of February 2016 [update] . The site has a default "Front Page" which contains staff selected popular articles, and also an "All Page" which contains only the very top ranked article/ subreddits as ranked by readers themselves, and which page is accessible via an "All" link at the top of the "Front Page."
In an interview with Memeburn , Reddit GM, Martin noted that the platform's "approach is to give the community moderators or curators as much control as possible so that they can shape and cultivate the type of communities they want". [30]

IAmA and AMA
One of the most popular subreddits is IAmA ("I Am A") where a user may post "AMAs" (for "Ask Me Anything"), or similarly "AMAAs" (for "Ask Me Almost/Absolutely Anything") – prompts for others to ask questions about any topic. AMAs are open to all Reddit users, and use the site's comment system for both questions and answers; it is similar to a press conference but online. This subreddit was founded in May 2009. [31] From 2013 to 2015, Victoria Taylor assisted reddit's volunteer community in presenting interviews. [32] [33] [34]
A number of notable individuals have participated in the IAmA subreddit or in an AMA, some of whom have appeared multiple times. Notable people who participated in the IAmA subreddit itself include then-United States President Barack Obama (while campaigning for the 2012 election [35] ), Bill Gates (multiple times), [36] and Donald Trump (also while campaigning). [37]
As of May 2017 [update] , Barack Obama's AMA is the highest rated on the site, followed by those for Victoria Taylor, Reddit's former director of talent; Ken Bone, an Illinois man who went viral during the 2016 U.S. presidential election ; Leah Remini , an actress who is a former member of Scientology ; and Bill Gates. [38] The increased traffic for Obama's AMA brought down many parts of the website when it occurred on August 29, 2012. [39]
Celebrities participating in IAmAs have seen both positive and negative responses. In 2012, Woody Harrelson 's AMA [40] was criticized after Harrelson declined to answer questions that were unrelated to the movie Rampart he was promoting. [41] Similarly, Bollywood actress Priyanka Chopra 's AMA was criticized for evasiveness when she focused on promoting her upcoming album to the detriment of other questions. [42] By contrast, rapper Snoop Dogg's 2012 AMA [43] attracted 1.6 million page views [44] after he provided several candid responses to the community's questions. [45] A particularly well received AMA of 2014 was that of Peter Dinklage , [46] best known for his role as Tyrion Lannister in the HBO drama series Game of Thrones . Redditors attribute the thread's success to the thoroughness of his responses and the fact that he stayed online much longer than he was expected to so he could spend more time with his fans. The actor departed by commenting:
On July 2, 2015, hundreds of subreddits, including several with over a million subscribers, were set to private by their respective moderators after Victoria Taylor was dismissed. [48] [49] [50] [51] Sources close to Reddit cited an increased focus on commercializing AMAs as the most likely reason. [52] [53]

/r/science
/r/science is an Internet forum on Reddit where the community of participants discuss science topics. [54] A popular feature of the forum is "Ask me Anything" (AMA) public discussions. [54] As of 2014, /r/science attracted 30,000–100,000 visitors per day, making it the largest community-managed science forum and an attractive place to host discussions. [54]

April Fools subreddits

The Button
On April Fools' Day 2015, a social experiment was launched in the form of a subreddit called "thebutton". It featured a button and a 60-second countdown timer. User accounts created before that day were eligible to participate. A user could only ever click the button once, or opt not to click it. If a user clicked the button the timer was globally reset to 60 seconds, [55] and the user's "flair" (an icon next to the user's name) changed color. Colors were assigned based on a gradient from purple to red with purple signifying up to 60 seconds and red as low as 0 seconds. The countdown prematurely reached zero several times due to technical problems but eventually expired without further problems on June 5, 2015, after which the subreddit was archived. [56]

Robin
On April Fools' Day 2016, a social experiment was launched in the form of a chat widget named Robin. After clicking the "Robin" button, an IRC -like chat window was initially opened with one other user and gave a certain time to pick between three options, "Grow," "Stay" and "Leave". [57] "Grow" would join the chat with another group, "Stay" would close the group chat and create a subreddit with that group as moderators and "Leave" would close the group chat.

Place
On April Fools' Day 2017, a social experiment was launched in the form of a subreddit called "place". It featured a collaborative pixel art canvas, where a user could place a pixel every five minutes (the timer was temporarily ten and twenty minutes for a few hours on April 1). [58] Many people worked together to create large graphics, such as flags or symbols. Often subreddits would come together as a group to add a graphic from that community to place.
Place was closed on April 3, 2017 at 1:00 PM GMT having been active for a full three days. [59]

History
In June 2005, [60] Reddit was founded in Medford, Massachusetts by Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian , both 22-year-old graduates of the University of Virginia. [61] The team expanded to include Christopher Slowe in November 2005. Between November 2005 and January 2006 Reddit merged with Aaron Swartz 's company Infogami, and Swartz became an equal owner of the resulting parent company, Not A Bug. [62] [63] Condé Nast Publications, owner of Wired , acquired Reddit on October 31, 2006, and the team moved to San Francisco. [64] In January 2007, Swartz was fired. [65]
By the end of 2008, the team had grown to include Erik Martin, Jeremy Edberg, [66] David King, [67] and Mike Schiraldi. [68] In 2009, Huffman and Ohanian moved on to form Hipmunk , recruiting Slowe [69] and King [70] shortly thereafter. In May 2010, Reddit was named in Lead411's "2010 Hottest San Francisco Companies" list. [71] In July 2010, after explosive traffic growth, Reddit introduced Reddit Gold, offering new features for a price of $3.99/month or $29.99/year. [72] Reddit Gold adds a number of features to the interface, including the ability to display more comments on a page, access to the private "lounge" subreddit, and notifications whenever one's username is mentioned in a comment. It's also possible to endow comments or submissions of other users and thereby give a gold membership to them as an anonymous present. [73]
On September 6, 2011, Reddit became operationally independent of Condé Nast, now operating as a separate subsidiary of its parent company, Advance Publications. [74] On January 11, 2012, Reddit announced that it would be participating in a 12-hour sitewide blackout in protest of the Stop Online Piracy Act . [75] The blackout occurred on January 18 and coincided with the blackouts of Wikipedia and several other websites. In May 2012, Reddit joined the Internet Defense League , a group formed to organize future protests. [76] On February 14, 2013, Reddit began accepting the digital currency bitcoin for its Reddit Gold subscription service through a partnership with bitcoin payment processor Coinbase. [77]
In October 2014, Reddit announced Redditmade, a service which allowed moderators to create merchandise for their subreddits. Redditmade closed in February 2015. [78] In November 2014, Chief Executive Yishan Wong resigned and co-founder Ohanian returned as the full-time executive chairman. Ellen Pao , Reddit's business and partnerships strategist became the interim chief executive. [79] On July 10, 2015, Pao resigned and was replaced by Steve Huffman as CEO. [80] [81]
In October 2015, Reddit announced a news portal called Upvoted, designed to broaden the reach of Reddit as a standalone site featuring editorial content from Reddit users. [82] In April 2016, Reddit launched a new blocking tool in an attempt to curb online harassment . The tool allows a user to hide posts and comments from selected redditors in addition to blocking private messages from those redditors. [83] The option to block a redditor is done by clicking a button in the inbox.

Technology
Reddit was originally written in Common Lisp but was rewritten in Python in December 2005. [4] The reasons given for the switch were wider access to code libraries and greater development flexibility. The Python web framework that former Reddit employee Swartz developed to run the site, web.py , is now available as an open-source project. [84] On June 18, 2008, Reddit became an open source project. [85] With the exception of the anti-spam/cheating portions, all of the code and libraries written for Reddit became freely available on GitHub . [86] As of November 10, 2009 [update] , Reddit uses Pylons as its web framework. [87]
As of November 10, 2009 [update] , Reddit has decommissioned their physical servers and migrated to Amazon Web Services . [88] Reddit uses PostgreSQL as their primary datastore and is slowly moving to Apache Cassandra , a column-oriented datastore. It uses RabbitMQ for offline processing, HAProxy for load balancing and memcached for caching. In early 2009, Reddit started using jQuery . [89] On June 7, 2010, Reddit staff launched a revamped mobile interface featuring rewritten CSS , a new color scheme, and a multitude of improvements. [90]
On July 21, 2010, Reddit outsourced the Reddit search engine to Flaptor, who used its search product IndexTank. [91] As of July 12, 2012 [update] , Reddit uses Amazon CloudSearch . [92] There are several unofficial applications that use the Reddit API in the Google Play store, and F-Droid repository. Examples include: Reddit is Fun , [93] Andreddit , [94] F5 , BaconReader , [95] Reddit Sync [96] and an Android tablet specific application called Reddita . [97] There are also several Windows apps used to access Reddit, including unofficial Reddit apps such as ReddHub [98] and Reddit To Go! . [99] An unofficial desktop application Reditr [100] exists that is compatible with Windows, OS X, Linux and ChromeOS.
There are several Reddit applications for iOS . These include Karma, Upvote, iReddit, iPad-specific applications such as Reddzine and Biscuit, and, until April 2016, Alien Blue . [101] In September 2014, an official mobile application for browsing AMA (Ask Me Anything) threads was released for the iOS and Android platforms under the name Ask me Anything . [102] In October 2014, Alien Blue was acquired by Reddit and became the official iOS Reddit app. [103] In April 2016, Reddit released an official application called Reddit: The Official App, which is available on Google Play and the iOS App Store, and Alien Blue was removed from the App Store in favor of the new app. [104]

Demographics
Statistics from Google Ad Planner suggest that 74% of all Reddit users are male [105] In 2016 the Pew Research Center published research showing 67% of Reddit users are men; 71% of users who read news on the site are men. As of the end of 2016, Reddit is the only major social media platform that does not have a female majority user base. [106]
Users tend to be significantly younger than average with less than 1% of users being 65+. [107]

Community and culture
The website is known for its open nature and diverse user community that generate its content. [108] Its demographics allows for wide-ranging subject areas, or main subreddits, that receive much attention, as well as the ability for smaller subreddits to serve more niche purposes. For example, the University of Reddit, a subreddit that exists to communally teach, emerged from the ability to enter and leave the online forum, the "classroom", at will, and classes ranging from computer science to music, to fine art theory exist. [109] The unique possibilities that subreddits provide create new opportunities for raising attention and fostering discussion across many areas. In gaining popularity in terms of unique users per day, Reddit has been a platform for many to raise publicity for a number of causes. And with that increased ability to garner attention and a large audience, users can use one of the largest communities on the Internet for new, revolutionary, and influential purposes. [110]
Its popularity has enabled users to take unprecedented advantage of such a large community. Its innovative socially ranked rating and sorting system drives a method that is useful for fulfilling certain goals of viewership or simply finding answers to interesting questions. User sentiments about the website's function and structure include feelings about the breadth and depth of the discussions on Reddit and how the site makes it easy to discover new and interesting items. Almost all of the user reviews on Alexa.com, which rates Reddit's monthly unique traffic rating 125th in the United States, mention Reddit's "good content" as a likable quality. However, others raise the negative aspects of the potential for Reddit's communities to possess a "hive mind" of sorts, [111] embodying some negative aspects of group interaction theories like crowd psychology and collective consciousness .

Philanthropic efforts
Reddit has been known as the instigator of several charity projects, some short and others long-term, in order to benefit others. A selection of major events are outlined below:

Sociopolitical efforts
Reddit can and has been used for a wide variety of political purposes including the presidential campaigns of Barack Obama and Donald Trump . [138] [139] [140] It has also been used for self-organizing sociopolitical activism such as protests, communication with politicians and active communities. Reddit has become a prime location for people worldwide to openly discuss politics. [141]

March for Science
The March for Science originated from a discussion on reddit that informed about all references to climate change having been deleted from the White House website about which a user commented that "There needs to be a Scientists' March on Washington". [142] [143] [144]

Internet privacy, neutrality and anonymity
Many reddit users are highly engaged in the defense of Internet privacy , net neutrality and Internet anonymity . In advance of legislations that endanger these redditors typically set up pages to organize protest, create and curate content (e.g. media), call responsible authorities and inform about their issues and e.g. relevant tools and organizations.
On January 11, 2012, Reddit announced that it would be participating in a 12-hour sitewide blackout in protest of the Stop Online Piracy Act . [145] The blackout occurred on January 18 and coincided with the blackouts of Wikipedia and several other websites. In May 2012, Reddit joined the Internet Defense League , a group formed to organize future protests. [146]

Cannabis legalization
A majority of the site's users seems to support legalization of marijuana. [ citation needed ]
The subreddit dedicated to cannabis culture /r/trees is most active in this regard and often organizes, coordinates or supports drug reform campaigns. [147] [148] [149] [150]
In 2010, the site ran ads promoting marijuana legalization without charge after Conde Nast stated that they do not want to benefit financially from this particular issue. [151]

Reddit's model
Reddit's model could be seen as to having sociopolitical aspects. It is built upon crowdsourcing , user generated content , [152] sharing , altruism, [152] gamification , [152] social reputation [152] and social relevance (opposed to monetary return), participation , [152] freedom of speech , openness , participatory [153] and/or self-governance , new forms of interaction (e.g. #IAmA and AMA ) and collective intelligence .

Commercial activity
In February 2013, Betabeat published a post that recognized the influx of multi-national corporations like Costco , Taco Bell , Subaru , and McDonald's posting branded content on Reddit that was made to appear as if it was original content from legitimate Reddit users. [154] Reddit's former Director of Communications noted that while a large number of Chief Marketing Officers want to "infiltrate the reddit community on behalf of their brand," she emphasized that "self-promotion is frowned upon" and the site is "100 percent organic." [155] [156] [157] [158] She recommended that advertisers design promotions that "spark conversations and feedback." [159] She recommended that businesses use AMAs to get attention for public figures but cautioned "It is important to approach AMAs carefully and be aware that this may not be a fit for every project or client." [160] Nissan ran a successful Branded content promotion offering users free gifts to publicize a new car, [161] [162] though the company was later ridiculed for suspected astroturfing when the CEO only answered puff piece questions on the site. [163] [164] Taylor described these situations as "high risk" noting "We try hard to educate people that they have to treat questions that may seem irreverent or out of left field the same as they would questions about the specific project they are promoting." [165]
Reddit's users are more privacy-conscious than on other websites, using tools like AdBlock and proxies , [166] and they hate "feeling manipulated by brands" but respond well to "content that begs for intelligent viewers and participants." [167] Lauren Orsini writes in ReadWrite that "Reddit's huge community is the perfect hype machine for promoting a new movie, a product release, or a lagging political campaign" but "very specific set of etiquette. Redditors don't want to advertise for you, they want to talk to you." [168] Journalists have used the site as a basis for stories, though they are advised by the site's policies to respect that "reddit's communities belong to their members" and to seek proper attribution for people's contributions. [169]
Reddit announced that they would begin using VigLink to redirect affiliate links in June 2016. [170]

Reddit effect
Also known as the " Slashdot effect", the Reddit effect occurs when a smaller website has a high influx of traffic after being linked to on Reddit. [171] It is also called the "Reddit Hug of Death" among the website's users. Because Reddit is such a large site, the traffic is immense and can easily crash smaller sites. In order for users to see crashed websites, several Reddit bots have been created that take a snapshot of the website before large amounts of traffic flood the affected website.

"Restoring Truthiness" campaign
As a response to Glenn Beck 's August 28, 2010, Restoring Honor rally (heavily promoted by him in his Fox News broadcasts during the summer), in September 2010 Reddit users started a movement to persuade satirist Stephen Colbert to have a counter-rally in Washington, D.C. [172] The movement, which came to be called "Restoring Truthiness", was started by user mrsammercer, in a post where he described waking up from a dream in which Stephen Colbert was holding a satirical rally in D.C. [173] He writes, "This would be the high water mark of American satire. Half a million people pretending to suspend all rational thought in unison. Perfect harmony. It'll feel like San Francisco in the late 60s, only we won't be able to get any acid ."
The idea resonated with the Reddit community, which launched a campaign to bring the event to life. Over $600,000 [174] was raised for charity to gain the attention of Colbert. The campaign was mentioned on-air several times, and when the Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear was held in Washington, D.C. on October 30, 2010, thousands of redditors made the journey. [175]
During a post-rally press conference, Reddit co-founder Ohanian asked, "What role did the Internet campaign play in convincing you to hold this rally?" Jon Stewart responded by saying that, though it was a very nice gesture, the two had already thought of the idea prior and the deposit on using the National Mall was already paid during the summer, so it acted mostly as a "validation of what we were thinking about attempting". [176] In a message to the Reddit community, Colbert later added, "I have no doubt that your efforts to organize and the joy you clearly brought to your part of the story contributed greatly to the turnout and success." [177]

Controversies
The website generally lets moderators on individual subreddits make editorial decisions about what content to allow, and has a history of permitting some subreddits dedicated to controversial content. [178] Many of the default pages are highly moderated, with the "science" subreddit banning climate change denialism , [179] and the "news" subreddit banning opinion pieces and columns. [180] Reddit has changed its site-wide editorial policies several times, sometimes in reaction to controversies. [181] [182] [183] [184] Reddit has had a history of giving a platform to objectionable but legal content, and in 2011, news media covered the way that jailbait was being shared on the site before the site changed their policies to explicitly ban "suggestive or sexual content featuring minors". [185] Following some controversial incidents of Internet vigilantism , Reddit introduced a strict rule against the publication of non-public personally-identifying information via the site (colloquially known as doxxing ). Those who break the rule are subject to a site-wide ban, and their posts and even entire communities may be removed for breaking the rule.

2010
On December 16, 2010, a redditor named Matt posted a link describing how he has donated a kidney, and included a JustGive link to encourage users to give donations to the American Cancer Society . [186] After an initially positive reaction, Reddit users began to become suspicious of Matt's intentions, and suggested that he was keeping the donations for himself. Users telephoned his home and he received death threats. Matt eventually proved that he was genuine by uploading his doctor's records. [187]

2011
On October 18, 2011, an IT manager submitted a post to the subreddit "gameswap" offering Redditors to trade one of 312 codes he had been given for the game Deus Ex: Human Revolution . [188] A group of users obtained his personal details, and began to blackmail him for the codes. [189] The Monday after uploading the post, he received 138 threatening phone calls both at home and at his job, and by the end of the day he had been fired. [190]

2013
Following the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings , Reddit faced criticism after users wrongly identified a number of people as suspects. [191] Notable among misidentified bombing suspects was Sunil Tripathi , a student reported missing before the bombings took place. A body reported to be Sunil's was found in Providence River in Rhode Island on April 25, 2013, according to Rhode Island Health Department. The cause of death was not immediately known, but authorities said they did not suspect foul play. [192] The family later confirmed Tripathi's death was a result of suicide . [193] Reddit general manager Martin later issued an apology for this behavior, criticizing the "online witch hunts and dangerous speculation" that took place on the website. [194] The incident was later referenced in the season 5 episode of the CBS TV series The Good Wife titled "Whack-a-Mole," [195] as well as The Newsroom . [196] [197]
In late October 2013, the moderators of the "politics" subreddit banned a large group of websites. Many were left-wing opinion websites, such as Mother Jones , The Huffington Post , Salon , Alternet , Rawstory , The Daily Kos , Truthout , Media Matters , and ThinkProgress as well as some popular progressive blog sites, such as Democratic Underground and Crooks and Liars . They also banned a number of right-wing sites— Drudge Report , Breitbart News Breitbart , The Daily Caller , Dailypaul , Power Line , and Reason . Salon reported that "the section's moderators explained in a post on Tuesday, the goal is 'to reduce the number of blogspam submissions and sensationalist titles.' The purge, the moderators explained, is also aimed at sites that provide lots of "bad journalism." [198] The December 2013 list of banned websites has been modified since late October, and sites with original content, such as Mother Jones and The Huffington Post , are allowed. [199] Moderators also banned RT , which moderators stated was due to vote manipulation and spam, though one moderator stated that he wanted RT banned because it is Kremlin backed. [200] [201]

2014
In August 2014, photos from the 2014 celebrity photo hack were widely disseminated across the site. [202] [203] A dedicated subreddit, "TheFappening," was created for this purpose, [204] and contained links to most if not all of the criminally obtained explicit images. [205] [206] [207] [208] [209] Some images of Liz Lee and McKayla Maroney from the leak were identified by redditors and outside commentators as child pornography because the photos were taken when the women were underage. [210] The subreddit was banned on September 6. [211] The scandal led to wider criticisms concerning the website's administration from The Verge and The Daily Dot . [212] [213]
Also in August 2014, moderators and administrators censored a sizeable amount of content related to the Gamergate controversy ; one thread in the "gaming" subreddit had almost 24,000 comments removed. [214] Multiple subreddits were deleted by administrators for voicing opinions on Zoe Quinn , Anita Sarkeesian , Brianna Wu and similarly important Gamergate controversy figures. [215] The subreddit "ZoeQuinnDiscussion" was banned for violating the Reddit rules. [216] Administrators defended this response when questioned, blaming 4chan for raiding threads and causing harm. This was debated by some redditors. [217] An anonymous subreddit moderator claims he was removed for leaking correspondence between himself and Zoe Quinn. [218] On December 18, 2014, Reddit took the unusual step of banning a subreddit, "SonyGOP," that was being used to distribute hacked Sony files . [219]

2015
After Ellen Pao became CEO, she was initially a target of criticism by users who objected to her lawsuit. [220] Later on June 10, 2015, Reddit shut down the 150,000-subscriber "fatpeoplehate" subreddit and four others citing issues related to harassment. [221] This move was seen as very controversial; some commenters said that the bans went too far, while others said that the bans did not go far enough. [222] One of the latter complaints concerned a subreddit that was "expressing support" for the perpetrator of the Charleston church shooting . [223] Responding to the accusations of "skewed enforcement", Reddit reaffirmed their commitment to free expression and stated that "There are some subreddits with very little viewership that get highlighted repeatedly for their content, but those are a tiny fraction of the content on the site."
On July 2, 2015, Reddit began experiencing a series of blackouts as moderators set popular subreddit communities to private, in an event dubbed "AMAgeddon," a portmanteau of AMA ("ask me anything") and Armageddon . This was done in protest of the recent firing of Victoria Taylor, an administrator who helped organize citizen-led interviews with famous people on the popular "Ask me Anything" subreddit. Organizers of the blackout also expressed resentment about the recent severance of the communication between Reddit and the moderators of subreddits. [224] The blackout intensified on July 3 when former community manager David Croach gave an AMA about being fired. Before deleting his posts, he stated that Ellen Pao dismissed him with one year of health coverage when he had cancer and did not recover quickly enough. [225] [226] Following this, a Change.org petition to remove Pao as CEO of Reddit Inc. reached over 200,000 signatures. [227] [228] [229] Pao posted a response on July 3 as well as an extended version of it on July 6 in which she apologized for bad communication and not delivering on promises. She also apologized on behalf of the other administrators and noted that problems already existed over the past several years. [230] [231] [232] [233] On July 10, Pao resigned as CEO and was replaced by former CEO and co-founder Steve Huffman . [80] [234]
In August 2015, Steve Huffman introduced a policy which led to the banning of several offensive and sexual communities. Included in the ban was lolicon which Huffman referred to as "animated CP". [235] Some subreddits had also been quarantined due to having "highly-offensive or upsetting content", such as /r/European, /r/swedenyes, /r/drawpeople, /r/kiketown, /r/blackfathers, /r/greatapes, and /r/whitesarecriminals. [236]

2016
In May 2016, Reddit CEO Steve Huffman said on an interview at the TNW Conference that, unlike Facebook, which "only knows what [its users are] willing to declare publicly", Reddit knows its users' "dark secrets" [237] [238] [239] at the same time that the website's "values" page was updated in regards to its "privacy" section. The video reached the top of the website's main feed. [239] [240] Shortly thereafter, announcements concerning new advertisement content drew criticism on the website. [241] [242]
In September 2016, a Redditor named mormondocuments released thousands of administrative documents belonging to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints , an action driven by the ex-Mormon and atheist communities of that site. Previously, on April 22 of that year, the same Redditor had announced his plans to do so. Church officials commented that the documents did not contain anything confidential. [243] [244]
On November 23, 2016, Steve Huffman admitted to modifying the contents of many public user comments on Reddit that he disliked. [245] [246] He did so by changing insulting comments made towards him and made it appear as if the insult were directed at the moderators of the " /r/The_Donald " community. [247]
On November 24, 2016, the Washington Post reported Reddit had banned the " Pizzagate " conspiracy board from their site stating it violated their policy of posting personal information of others, triggering a wave of criticism from users on "/r/The_Donald", a popular pro-Trump subreddit, who felt the ban amounted to censorship. [248] The Reddit forum "Pizzagate" was devoted to a conspiracy theory derived from the John Podesta leaked emails, a theory that alleged the D.C. Pizzeria Comet Ping Pong "is at the center of a child-abuse ring tied to John Podesta, Mrs. Clinton’s former campaign manager". [249] After the forum was banned from Reddit, the wording "We don't want witchhunts on our site" now appears on the former page of the Pizzagate subreddit. [249] [250]
On November 30, 2016 CEO Steve Huffman announced changes to the algorithm of their /r/all page to block 'stickied' posts from a number of subreddits, such as /r/The_Donald. In the announcement, the CEO also apologized for personally editing posts by users from /r/The_Donald, and declared intentions to take actions against "hundreds of the most toxic users" of Reddit and "communities whose users continually cross the line". [6] [251] [252]

2017
In February 2017, Reddit banned the alt-right forum for violating its terms of service, more specifically for attempting to share personal information about the man who attacked alt-right figure Richard B. Spencer . [253] [254] The forum's users and moderators accused Reddit administrators of having political motivations for the ban. [255] [256]

Other
Imgur is an online image sharing community and image host started in 2009 that was designed to be a gift to the online community of Reddit, [257] that jumped from a thousand hits per day to a million total page views in the first five months. [258]

Overview
The Washington Post is generally regarded as one of the leading daily American newspapers, [13] along with The New York Times , The L.A. Times , and The Wall Street Journal . The Post has distinguished itself through its political reporting on the workings of the White House , Congress , and other aspects of the U.S. government . It is one of the two daily broadsheets published in Washington D.C. , the other being its smaller rival The Washington Times .
Unlike The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal , The Washington Post does not print an edition for distribution away from the East Coast . In 2009, the newspaper ceased publication of its National Weekly Edition , which combined stories from the week's print editions, due to shrinking circulation. [14] The majority of its newsprint readership is in District of Columbia and its suburbs in Maryland and Northern Virginia . [15]
The newspaper's weekday and Saturday printings include the following sections: [ when? ]
Sunday editions largely include the weekday sections as well as Outlook (opinion), Arts, Travel, Comics, TV Week, and the Washington Post Magazine . The Sunday Style section differs slightly from the weekday Style section; it is in a tabloid format, and it houses the reader-written humor contest The Style Invitational .
Additional weekly sections appear on weekdays: Health & Science on Tuesday, Food on Wednesday, Local Living (home and garden) on Thursday, and Weekend, with details about upcoming events in the local area, on Friday. The latter two are in a tabloid format.
The newspaper is one of a few U.S. newspapers with foreign bureaus , located in Beirut , Berlin , Beijing , Bogota , Cairo , Hong Kong , Islamabad , Jerusalem , Kabul , London , Mexico City , Moscow , Nairobi , New Delhi , Paris , and Tokyo . [16] In November 2009, it announced the closure of its U.S. regional bureaus—Chicago, Los Angeles and New York—as part of an increased focus on "...political stories and local news coverage in Washington". [17] The newspaper has local bureaus in Maryland ( Annapolis , Montgomery County , Prince George's County , Southern Maryland ) and Virginia ( Alexandria , Fairfax , Loudoun County , Richmond , and Prince William County ). [18]
As of May 2013 [update] , its average weekday circulation was 474,767, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations , making it the seventh largest newspaper in the country by circulation , behind USA Today , The Wall Street Journal , The New York Times , the Los Angeles Times , the Daily News , and the New York Post . While its circulation (like that of almost all newspapers) has been slipping, it has one of the highest market-penetration rates of any metropolitan news daily. [19]
For many decades, the Post had its main office at 1150 15th Street NW. This real estate remained with Graham Holdings when the newspaper was sold to Jeff Bezos' Nash Holdings in 2013. Graham Holdings sold 1150 15th Street (along with 1515 L Street, 1523 L Street, and land beneath 1100 15th Street) for US$159 million in November 2013. The Washington Post continued to lease space at 1150 L Street NW. [20] In May 2014, The Washington Post leased the west tower of One Franklin Square , a high-rise building at 1301 K Street NW in Washington, D.C. The newspaper moved into their new offices December 14, 2015. [21]

History

Founding and early period
The newspaper was founded in 1877 by Stilson Hutchins (1838–1912) and in 1880 added a Sunday edition, becoming the city's first newspaper to publish seven days a week. In 1889, Hutchins sold the newspaper to Frank Hatton , a former Postmaster General, and Beriah Wilkins , a former Democratic congressman from Ohio. To promote the newspaper, the new owners requested the leader of the United States Marine Band , John Philip Sousa , to compose a march for the newspaper's essay contest awards ceremony. Sousa composed " The Washington Post ". [22] It became the standard music to accompany the two-step , a late 19th-century dance craze , [23] and remains one of Sousa's best-known works.
In 1893, the newspaper moved to a building at 14th and E streets NW, where it would remain until 1950. [24] This building combined all functions of the newspaper into one headquarters – newsroom, advertising, typesetting, and printing - that ran 24 hours per day. [24]
In 1898, during the Spanish–American War , the Post printed Clifford K. Berryman's classic illustration Remember the Maine , which became the battle-cry for American sailors during the War. In 1902, Berryman published another famous cartoon in the Post — Drawing the Line in Mississippi . This cartoon depicts President Theodore Roosevelt showing compassion for a small bear cub and inspired New York store owner Morris Michtom to create the teddy bear . [25]
Wilkins acquired Hatton's share of the newspaper in 1894 at Hatton's death. After Wilkins' death in 1903, his sons John and Robert ran the Post for two years before selling it in 1905 to John Roll McLean , owner of the Cincinnati Enquirer . During the Wilson presidency, the Post was credited with the "most famous newspaper typo " in D.C. history according to Reason magazine; the Post intended to report that President Wilson had been "entertaining" his future-wife Mrs. Galt, but instead wrote that he had been "entering" Mrs. Galt. [26] [27] [28] When John McLean died in 1916, he put the newspaper in trust, having little faith that his playboy son Edward "Ned" McLean could manage his inheritance. Ned went to court and broke the trust, but, under his management, the newspaper slumped toward ruin.

Meyer–Graham period
The newspaper was purchased in a bankruptcy auction in 1933 by the former Chairman of the Federal Reserve's board of governors, Eugene Meyer , who restored the newspaper's health and reputation. In 1946, Meyer was succeeded as publisher by his son-in-law, Philip Graham . [29]
In 1954, the newspaper consolidated its position by acquiring and merging with its last morning rival, the Washington Times-Herald . [30] (The combined paper was officially named The Washington Post and Times-Herald until 1973, although the Times-Herald portion of the nameplate became less and less prominent after the 1950s.) The merger left the Post with two remaining local competitors, the afternoon Washington Star ( Evening Star ) and The Washington Daily News , which merged in 1972 and folded in 1981. [31] [32] The Washington Times , established in 1982 by Unification Church leader Sun Myung Moon (1920–2012) under his company News World Communications , has been a local conservative rival with a circulation (as of 2005 [update] ) about one-seventh that of the Post . [33] In the late 2000s additional editorially conservative competition increased with the foundation of the tabloid-format daily The Washington Examiner by the new owners of the old Hearst paper, the San Francisco Examiner who engineered a swap trading the larger, more prosperous San Francisco Chronicle for the former Hearst "flagship" paper. They also started several other tabloid-format Examiners in several American cities, including briefly for two years the Baltimore Examiner which competed against the 170-year-old Baltimore Sun . The Washington Examiner ceased publication of its local newspaper on June 14, 2013, still publishing a weekly magazine and an online website focused on national politics.
After Phil Graham's death in 1963, control of The Washington Post Company passed to Katharine Graham (1917–2001), his wife and Meyer's daughter. Few women had run nationally prominent newspapers in the United States. Katharine Graham described her own anxiety and lack of confidence based on her gender in her autobiography. She served as publisher from 1969 to 1979 and headed The Washington Post Company into the early 1990s as chairman of the board and CEO. After 1993, she retained a position as chairman of the executive committee until her death in 2001.
Her tenure is credited with seeing the newspaper rise in national stature through effective investigative reporting after it began to live down its reputation as a house organ for the Kennedy and Johnson administration, working to ensure that The New York Times did not surpass its Washington reporting of the Pentagon Papers and Watergate scandal. During this time, Katharine Graham also oversaw the Post company's diversification purchase of the for-profit education and training company Kaplan, Inc. for $40 million in 1984. [34] Twenty years later, Kaplan had surpassed the Post newspaper as the company's leading contributor to income, and by 2010 Kaplan accounted for more than 60% of the entire company revenue stream. [35]
Executive editor Ben Bradlee , a Kennedy loyalist, put the newspaper's reputation and resources behind reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein , who, in a long series of articles, chipped away at the story behind the 1972 burglary of Democratic National Committee offices in the Watergate Hotel complex in Washington. The Post 's dogged coverage of the story, the outcome of which ultimately played a major role in the resignation of President Richard Nixon , won the newspaper a Pulitzer Prize in 1973.
In 1972, the "Book World" section was introduced with Pulitzer Prize–winning critic William McPherson as its first editor. [36] It featured Pulitzer Prize–winning critics such as Jonathan Yardley and Michael Dirda , the latter of whom established his career as a critic at the Post . In 2009, after 37 years, with great reader outcries and protest, The Washington Post Book World as a standalone insert was discontinued, the last issue being Sunday, February 15, 2009, [37] along with a general reorganization of the paper, such as placing the Sunday editorials on the back page of the main front section rather than the "Outlook" section and distributing some other locally oriented "op-ed" letters and commentaries in other sections. [38] However, book reviews are still published in the Outlook section on Sundays and in the Style section the rest of the week, as well as online. [38]
In 1980, the newspaper published a dramatic story called "Jimmy's World", [39] describing the life of an eight-year-old heroin addict in Washington, for which reporter Janet Cooke won acclaim and a Pulitzer Prize . Subsequent investigation, however, revealed the story to be a fabrication. The Pulitzer Prize was returned.
Donald E. Graham , Katharine's son, succeeded her as publisher in 1979 and in the early 1990s became both chief executive officer and chairman of the board. He was succeeded in 2000 as publisher and CEO by Boisfeuillet Jones, Jr. , with Graham remaining as chairman.
Katharine Graham Weymouth served as publisher and chief executive officer until 2014, after Jeff Bezos took over ownership of the paper.

Post-Graham period
In 1996, the newspaper established a website . [40]
In 2008, Marcus Brauchli replaced long-time executive editor Leonard Downie, Jr. , serving publisher Katharine Weymouth . [41]
In 2010, the newspaper cited its local focus as a reason for running its first-ever front-page advertisement: the Capital One ad was being run to draw attention to the rebranding of Chevy Chase Bank , a bank Capital One bought in 2009. According to the Post ' s vice president of advertising, the page one advertisement is a "...very local, useful-information-for-our-readers type of campaign". [42]
In November 2012, Weymouth announced that Boston Globe editor Martin Baron would take over Brauchli's position on January 2, 2013. [43] [44]
In 2013, the newspaper announced that it had plans to start charging frequent users of its website, with many exceptions (such as for government employees browsing from work, and for students browsing from school). [45] [46]

Jeff Bezos era (2013–present)
Jeff Bezos purchased the newspaper for US$250 million in cash, completing the transaction on October 1, 2013, after announcing the planned acquisition on August 5, 2013. [1] [2] [11] The newspaper is currently owned by Nash Holdings LLC, a holding company created for the acquisition and controlled by Bezos. [1] The sale included the Spanish language newspaper El Tiempo Latino , the Fairfax Times , The Gazette , the free daily newspaper Express , Southern Maryland Newspapers, and several newspapers covering and for the U.S. armed forces. [47] Nash Holdings also took ownership of the Post printing plants in Springfield, Virginia ; Fairfax County, Virginia ; and Laurel, Maryland (the "Comprint plant"). [47] [48] Other assets included in the sale were the publications Apartment Showcase , Capital Business , Fashion Washington , Guide to Retirement Living Sourcebook , New Condominium Guide , and New Homes Guide ; the Internet sites TheCapitolDeal.com and ServiceAlley.com; and Comprint Military Publications (which included eight weekly newspapers covering local military bases, 10 annual guides to local military bases, and the Web sites DCMilitary.com, DCMilitaryEd.com, DCMilitaryFamLife.com). [48] Some real estate was also included in the deal, such as a one-story office building in St. Mary's County, Maryland ; warehouses in Fairfax County, Virginia; two tracts of land in Fairfax County, Virginia; leased office space in Charles County, Maryland , and in Montgomery County, Maryland ; and 23 acres of undeveloped land in Charles County, Maryland. [48]
Not included in the sale were other Washington Post Company assets, including the Washington Post Company's downtown office building, the Post's Robinson Terminal facilities in Alexandria, Virginia; Post-Newsweek Stations; Cable ONE (a Phoenix, Arizona -based Internet and cable service provider); independent web-based media assets such as Slate Group ( Slate magazine and its sister video magazine, Slate V), The Root , and Foreign Policy ; social media marketing company Social Code; home healthcare and hospice provider Celtic Healthcare; and the energy parts supplier Forney Corporation. [12] [49] After the completion of the sale, a press release announced the name change of the Washington Post Company to Graham Holdings Company (the change was made effective on November 29, 2013). [12] [49]
In early September 2013, Bezos summarized his approach for the news organization—with a vision that recreates "the 'daily ritual' of reading the Post as a bundle, not merely a series of individual stories"‍—‌although he indicated that the experience was more likely to be created on tablet computers and less likely "on the Web". [50] Bezos has been described as a "hands-off owner", holding teleconference calls with executive editor Martin Baron every two weeks. [51]
In August 2014, The Washington Post launched "Get There", an online personal finance section. [52]
In September 2014, Jeff Bezos announced his decision to appoint Frederick J. Ryan Jr. , founding President and CEO of Politico , to serve as Publisher and CEO of The Washington Post , effective October 1, 2014. This signaled Bezo's intent to shift The Post to a more digital focus with a strategy for expanding to a broader national and global readership. Ryan has continued to invest in news and technology while reducing expenses in legacy print areas. [53]
Nash Holdings divested itself of a number of newspapers, and closed two others, in the summer of 2015. The company announced on June 12, 2015, that it would close the Montgomery Gazette and Prince George's Gazette effective June 18, 2015. The company also sold Comprint Military Publications and its Southern Maryland Newspapers group (which consisted of the Maryland Independent , The Enterprise , the Calvert Recorder , and the Enquirer Gazette , and their associated Southern Maryland Newspaper Web site) to Adams Publishing Group. The company also said it would sell the Fairfax County Times to Whip It Media, a locally owned company founded by the Times' former general manager, Richard Whippen. [54]
In August 2014, the Post announced it will be moving into new headquarters space at One Franklin Square in December 2015. The company leased 242,000 square feet (22,500 m 2 ) of space for 16 years on floors four through nine in the west tower and floors seven and eight in the east tower. The building's owner agreed to an extensive build-out: Only about 10 percent of the space will be private offices, which required extensive demolition of interior walls and the removal of the walls on the seventh and eighth floor in the east tower so they joined with the floors on the west tower. The newly joined space will create two 60,000-square-foot (5,600 m 2 ) floors capable of accommodating 700 newsroom workers and software engineers. The build-out includes four sets for live television filming, a new staircase between the seventh and eighth floors in each tower, and a two-story auditorium on the fourth floor. The building's south-facing facade will also be altered to give Post workers floor-to-ceiling windows. [55]

Political stance

1970–2000
In the mid-1970s, some conservatives called the newspaper " Pravda on the Potomac " because of its perceived left-wing bias in both reporting and editorials. [56] Since then, the appellation has been used by both liberal and conservative critics of the newspaper. [57] [58] In 1963, FBI director J. Edgar Hoover reportedly told President Lyndon B. Johnson , "I don't have much influence with the Post because I frankly don't read it. I view it like the Daily Worker ." [59] [60]

2000–present
On March 26, 2007, Chris Matthews said on his television program, "Well, The Washington Post is not the liberal newspaper it was, Congressman, let me tell you. I have been reading it for years and it is a neocon newspaper". [61] It has regularly published an ideological mixture of op-ed columnists, some of them left-leaning (including E.J. Dionne , Dana Milbank , Greg Sargent , and Eugene Robinson ), and many on the right (including George Will , Marc Thiessen , Michael Gerson and Charles Krauthammer ).
In a study published on April 18, 2007, by Yale professors Alan Gerber, Dean Karlan, and Daniel Bergan, citizens were given a subscription to either the conservative-leaning Washington Times or the liberal-leaning Washington Post to see the effect that media has on voting patterns. Gerber had estimated based on his work that the Post slanted as much to the left as the Times did to the right. Gerber found those who were given a free subscription of the Post were 8 percentage points more likely to vote for the Democratic candidate for governor than those assigned to the control group. [62] [63]
In November 2007, the newspaper was criticized by independent journalist Robert Parry for reporting on anti-Obama chain e-mails without sufficiently emphasizing to its readers the false nature of the anonymous claims. [64] In 2009, Parry criticized the newspaper for its allegedly unfair reporting on liberal politicians, including Vice President Al Gore and President Barack Obama . [65]
Responding to criticism of the newspaper's coverage during the run-up to the 2008 presidential election , former Post ombudsman Deborah Howell wrote: "The opinion pages have strong conservative voices; the editorial board includes centrists and conservatives; and there were editorials critical of Obama. Yet opinion was still weighted toward Obama." [66] According to a 2009 Oxford University Press book by Richard Davis on the impact of blogs on American politics, liberal bloggers link to The Washington Post and The New York Times more often than other major newspapers; however, conservative bloggers also link predominantly to liberal newspapers. [67]
In mid-September 2016, Matthew Ingram of Forbes joined Glenn Greenwald of the Intercept , and Trevor Trimm of The Guardian in cricitizing The Washington Post for "demanding that [former National Security Agency contractor Edward] Snowden...stand trial on espionage charges". [68] [69] [70] [71] In late-November 2016, Matt Taibi , writing for Rolling Stone joined in [72] with Ingram and Greenwald in criticizing the Post , this time for sourcing a long list of putatively "useful idiots" for Russian propagandists to PropOrNot , a group described by The Intercept as "new, hidden, and very shady." Among the news websites reported on the list were Naked Capitalism , Truthdig , the Drudge Report and Zero Hedge . [73] [74]
In December 2016, The Post published a story inaccurately stating that a Russian hacking operation had infiltrated the U.S. electrical grid ; the claim was retracted in a revised version of the story, after the initial version had been widely circulated. [75] [76]

Political endorsements
Katharine Graham wrote in her autobiography Personal History that the newspaper long had a policy of not making endorsements for political candidates. However, since at least 2000, the newspaper has occasionally endorsed Republican politicians, such as Maryland Governor Robert Ehrlich . [77] In 2006, it repeated its historic endorsements of every Republican incumbent for Congress in Northern Virginia . [78] There have also been times when the Post has specifically chosen not to endorse any candidate, such as in the 1988 presidential election when it refused to endorse then-Governor Michael Dukakis or then-Vice President George H. W. Bush . [79] On October 17, 2008, the Post endorsed Barack Obama for President of the United States . [80] On October 25, 2012, the newspaper endorsed the re-election of Barack Obama. [81] On October 21, 2014, the newspaper endorsed 44 Democratic candidates versus 3 Republican candidates for the 2014 elections in the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia. [82] On October 13, 2016, it endorsed Hillary Clinton for the presidential election of that year. [83]
The Post's early endorsements in the 1978 elections for Maryland Governor (reformist Harry Hughes ) and for D.C. Mayor (a young Marion Barry ) allowed those candidates to tout their endorsements, thereby distinguishing them from an otherwise crowded field of big name candidates.

Influence of 
In 1992, the PBS investigative news program Frontline suggested that the Post had moved to the right in response to its smaller, more conservative rival The Washington Times . The program quoted Paul Weyrich , one of the founders of the conservative Christian organization the Moral Majority , as saying " The Washington Post became very arrogant and they just decided that they would determine what was news and what wasn't news and they wouldn't cover a lot of things that went on. And The Washington Times has forced the Post to cover a lot of things that they wouldn't cover if the Times wasn't in existence." [84] In 2008, Thomas F. Roeser , the founder of the conservative Internet website The Chicago Daily Observer , also mentioned competition from The Washington Times as a factor moving the Post to the right. [85]

Controversies
In "Buying the War" on PBS, Bill Moyers noted 27 editorials supporting George W. Bush's ambitions to invade Iraq . National security correspondent Walter Pincus reported that he had been ordered to cease his reports that were critical of Republican administrations. [86] According to author and journalist Greg Mitchell , "By the Post 's own admission, in the months before the war, it ran more than 140 stories on its front page promoting the war, while contrary information "got lost," as one Post staffer told Kurtz ." [87]
In November 2016, the Post published a story that relied heavily on a report by PropOrNot , an anonymous internet group that seeks to expose what it calls Russian propaganda . PropOrNot published a list of websites they called "bona-fide 'useful idiots'" of the Russian government. [88] Andrew Cockburn , Washington editor for Harper's , was sharply critical of Post' s decision to put the story on its front page, calling the article a "sorry piece of trash". [89] Writers in The Intercept , Fortune , and Rolling Stone also criticized Post for including a report by an organization with no reputation for fact-checking in an article on "fake news". [90] [91] [92] Looking more carefully into their methodology, Adrian Chen , staff writer for The New Yorker , argued that PropOrNot's criteria for establishing propaganda were so broad that they could have included "not only Russian state-controlled media organizations, such as Russia Today , but nearly every news outlet in the world, including the Post itself" on their list. [93]
On January 18, 2017, Sarah Kaplan wrote an article regarding David Gelernter , calling him a "fiercely anti-intellectual computer scientist" for expressing doubt regarding climate change . [94] Her comment was criticized by conservative media such as Fox News and National Review , with both sources arguing that Gelernter is a visionary computer scientist from Yale University . [95] [96]

Work
Horvitz's research interests span theoretical and practical challenges with developing systems that perceive, learn, and reason. His contributions include advances in principles and applications of machine learning and inference, information retrieval , human-computer interaction , bioinformatics , and e-commerce .
Horvitz played a significant role in the use of probability and decision theory in artificial intelligence . His work raised the credibility of artificial intelligence in other areas of computer science and computer engineering , influencing fields ranging from human-computer interaction to operating systems . His research helped establish the link between artificial intelligence and decision science . As an example, he coined the concept of bounded optimality, a decision-theoretic approach to bounded rationality . [9]
He studied the use of probability and utility to guide automated reasoning for decision making. The methods include consideration of the solving of streams of problems [10] in environments over time. In related work, he applied probability and machine learning to identify hard problems and to guide theorem proving. [11]
He has issued long-term challenge problems for AI [12] —and has espoused a vision of open-world AI, [13] where machine intelligences have the ability to understand and perform well in the larger world where they encounter situations they have not seen before.
He has explored synergies between human and machine intelligence, with methods that learn about the complementarities between people and AI. He is a founder of the AAAI conference on Human Computation and Crowdsourcing. [14]
He co-authored probability-based methods to enhance privacy, including a model of altruistic sharing of data called community sensing [15] and stochastic privacy. [16]
Horvitz speaks on the topic of artificial intelligence , including on NPR and the Charlie Rose show . [17] [18] [19] Online talks include both technical lectures and presentations for general audiences ( TEDx Austin: Making Friends with Artificial Intelligence ).

AI and Society

Asilomar AI Study
He served as President of the AAAI from 2007-2009. As AAAI President, he called together and co-chaired the Asilomar AI study which culminated in a meeting of AI scientists at Asilomar in February 2009. The study considered the nature and timing of AI successes and reviewed concerns about directions with AI developments, including the potential loss of control over computer-based intelligences, and also efforts that could reduce concerns and enhance long-term societal outcomes. The study was the first meeting of AI scientists to address concerns about superintelligence and loss of control of AI and attracted interest by the public. [24]
In coverage of the Asilomar study, he said that scientists must study and respond to notions of superintelligent machines and concerns about artificial intelligence systems escaping from human control. [24] In a later NPR interview, he said that investments in scientific studies of superintelligences would be valuable to guide proactive efforts even if people believed that the probability of losing of control of AI was low because of the cost of such outcomes. [25]

One Hundred Year Study on Artificial Intelligence
In 2014, he defined and funded with his wife the One Hundred Year Study of Artificial Intelligence at Stanford University. [26] [27] A Stanford press release stated that sets of committees over a century will "study and anticipate how the effects of artificial intelligence will ripple through every aspect of how people work, live and play." A framing memo for the study calls out 18 topics, including monitoring and addressing possibilities of superintelligences and loss of control of AI.

Founding of Partnership on AI
He served as interim co-chair of an effort to establish the Partnership on AI , an organization that brought Amazon, Facebook, DeepMind, Google, IBM, and Microsoft together to found and fund a non-profit, multistakeholder organization. A press release in September 2016 states that the non-profit organization will be guided by balanced leadership that includes “academics, non-profits, and specialists in policy and ethics.” The goals are stated as including research activities, recommending best practices, and publishing in “areas such as ethics, fairness, and inclusivity; transparency, privacy, and interoperability; collaboration between people and AI systems; and the trustworthiness, reliability, and robustness” of AI technologies.

Negotiation
Negotiation is a dialogue between two or more people or parties intended to reach a beneficial outcome over one or more issues where a conflict exists with respect to at least one of these issues. This beneficial outcome can be for all of the parties involved, or just for one or some of them.
It is aimed to resolve points of difference, to gain advantage for an individual or collective , or to craft outcomes to satisfy various interests. It is often conducted by putting forward a position and making small concessions to achieve an agreement. The degree to which the negotiating parties trust each other to implement the negotiated solution is a major factor in determining whether negotiations are successful. In many cases, negotiation is not a zero-sum game , allowing for cooperation to improve the results of the negotiation.
People negotiate daily, often without considering it a negotiation. [1] [ page needed ] Negotiation occurs in organizations, including businesses, non-profits, and within and between governments as well as in sales and legal proceedings, and in personal situations such as marriage, divorce, parenting, etc. Professional negotiators are often specialized, such as union negotiators, leverage buyout negotiators, peace negotiator, or hostage negotiators . They may also work under other titles, such as diplomats , legislators , or brokers .

Types
Negotiation can take a wide variety of forms, from a trained negotiator acting on behalf of a particular organization or position in a formal setting to an informal negotiation between friends. Negotiation can be contrasted with mediation , where a neutral third party listens to each side's arguments and attempts to help craft an agreement between the parties. It can also be compared with arbitration , which resembles a legal proceeding. In arbitration, both sides make an argument as to the merits of their case and the arbitrator decides the outcome. This negotiation is also sometimes called positional or hard- bargaining negotiation.
Negotiation theorists generally distinguish between two types of negotiation. Different theorists use different labels for the two general types and distinguish them in different ways.

Distributive negotiation
Distributive negotiation is also sometimes called positional or hard-bargaining negotiation and attempts to distribute a "fixed pie" of benefits. Distributive negotiation operates under zero sum conditions and implies that any gain one party makes is at the expense of the other and vice versa. For this reason, distributive negotiation is also sometimes called win-lose because of the assumption that one person's gain results in another person's loss. Distributive negotiation examples include haggling prices on an open market, including the negotiation of the price of a car or a home.
In a distributive negotiation, each side often adopts an extreme position, knowing it will not be accepted—and then uses a combination of guile, bluffing, and brinkmanship to cede as little as possible before reaching a deal. Distributive bargainers conceive of negotiation as a process of distributing a fixed amount of value. [2] A distributive negotiation often involves people who have never had a previous interactive relationship, nor are they likely to do so again in the near future.
In the distributive approach each negotiator fights for the largest possible piece of the pie, so it may be quite appropriate—within certain limits—to regard the other side more as an adversary than a partner and to take a somewhat harder line. [3]

Integrative negotiation
Integrative negotiation is also called interest-based, merit-based, or principled negotiation. It is a set of techniques that attempts to improve the quality and likelihood of negotiated agreement by taking advantage of the fact that different parties value various outcomes differently. While distributive negotiation assumes there is a fixed amount of value (a "fixed pie") to be divided between the parties, integrative negotiation often attempts to create value in the course of the negotiation ("expand the pie").
Integrative negotiation often involves a higher degree of trust and the forming of a relationship. It can also involve creative problem-solving that aims to achieve mutual gains. It is also sometimes called win-win negotiation.
In the integrative approach, unlike the distributive approach, parties seek to find an arrangement that is in the best interest of both sides. A good agreement is not one with maximum gain, but optimum gain. Gains in this scenario are not at the expense of the other, but with him. [3]
A common negotiation technique in integrative negotiations involves trading one favor for another, commonly referred to as logrolling . It focuses on the underlying interests of the parties rather than their arbitrary starting positions, approaches negotiation as a shared problem rather than a personalized battle, and insists upon adherence to objective, principled criteria as the basis for agreement. [2]
Perspective taking in integrative negotiation can be helpful for a few reasons, including that it can help self-advocating negotiators to seek mutually beneficial solutions, and it increases the likelihood of logrolling (when a favor is traded for another i.e. quid pro quo). Social motivation can increase the chances of a party conceding to a negotiation. While concession is mandatory for negotiations, research shows that people who concede more quickly, are less likely to explore all integrative and mutually beneficial solutions. Therefore, conceding reduces the chance of an integrative negotiation. [4]
However, negotiators need not sacrifice effective negotiation in favor of a positive relationship between parties. Rather than conceding, each side can appreciate that the other has emotions and motivations of their own and use this to their advantage in discussing the issue. In fact, perspective-taking can help move parties toward a more integrative solution. Fisher et al illustrate a few techniques that effectively improve perspective-taking in their book Getting to Yes. , and through the following, negotiators can separate people from the problem itself.
Additionally, negotiators can use certain communication techniques to build a stronger relationship and develop more meaningful negotiation solution.

Bad faith
When a party pretends to negotiate, but secretly has no intention of compromising, the party is considered negotiating in bad faith . Bad faith is a concept in negotiation theory whereby parties pretend to reason to reach settlement, but have no intention to do so, for example, one political party may pretend to negotiate, with no intention to compromise, for political effect. [6] [7]
Bad faith negotiations are often used in political science and political psychology to refer to negotiating strategies in which there is no real intention to reach compromise, or a model of information processing . [8] The " inherent bad faith model " of information processing is a theory in political psychology that was first put forth by Ole Holsti to explain the relationship between John Foster Dulles ' beliefs and his model of information processing. [9] It is the most widely studied model of one's opponent. [10] A state is presumed implacably hostile, and contra-indicators of this are ignored. They are dismissed as propaganda ploys or signs of weakness. Examples are John Foster Dulles ' position regarding the Soviet Union, or Hamas 's position on the state of Israel . [10] [ neutrality is disputed ]

Strategies
There are many different ways to categorize the essential elements of negotiation.
One view of negotiation involves three basic elements: process , behavior and substance . The process refers to how the parties negotiate: the context of the negotiations, the parties to the negotiations, the tactics used by the parties, and the sequence and stages in which all of these play out. Behavior refers to the relationships among these parties, the communication between them and the styles they adopt. The substance refers to what the parties negotiate over: the agenda, the issues (positions and – more helpfully – interests), the options, and the agreement(s) reached at the end. [ citation needed ]
Another view of negotiation comprises four elements: strategy , process , tools , and tactics . Strategy comprises the top level goals – typically including relationship and the final outcome. Processes and tools include the steps to follow and roles to take in preparing for and negotiating with the other parties. Tactics include more detailed statements and actions and responses to others' statements and actions. Some add to this persuasion and influence , asserting that these have become integral to modern day negotiation success, and so should not be omitted. [ citation needed ]

Employing an advocate
A skilled negotiator may serve as an advocate for one party to the negotiation. The advocate attempts to obtain the most favorable outcomes possible for that party. In this process the negotiator attempts to determine the minimum outcome(s) the other party is (or parties are) willing to accept, then adjusts their demands accordingly. A "successful" negotiation in the advocacy approach is when the negotiator is able to obtain all or most of the outcomes their party desires, but without driving the other party to permanently break off negotiations.
Skilled negotiators may use a variety of tactics ranging from negotiation hypnosis, [ citation needed ] to a straightforward presentation of demands or setting of preconditions, to more deceptive approaches such as cherry picking . Intimidation and salami tactics may also play a part in swaying the outcome of negotiations. [ citation needed ]
Another negotiation tactic is bad guy/good guy. Bad guy/good guy is when one negotiator acts as a bad guy by using anger and threats. The other negotiator acts as a good guy by being considerate and understanding. The good guy blames the bad guy for all the difficulties while trying to get concessions and agreement from the opponent. [11]

BATNA
The best alternative to a negotiated agreement, or BATNA is the alternative option a negotiator holds should the current negotiation fails and does not reach agreement. The quality of a BATNA has the potential to improve a party's negotiation outcome. Understanding one's BATNA can empower an individual and allow him or her to set higher goals when moving forward. [12]

Conflict styles
Kenneth W. Thomas identified five styles or responses to negotiation. [13] [14] These ﬁve strategies have been frequently described in the literature and are based on the dual-concern model. [15] The dual concern model of conflict resolution is a perspective that assumes individuals' preferred method of dealing with conflict is based on two themes or dimensions [16]
Based on this model, individuals balance the concern for personal needs and interests with the needs and interests of others. The following five styles can be used based on individuals' preferences depending on their pro-self or pro-social goals. These styles can change over time, and individuals can have strong dispositions towards numerous styles.

Types of negotiators
Three basic kinds of negotiators have been identified by researchers involved in The Harvard Negotiation Project. These types of negotiators are: soft bargainers, hard bargainers, and principled bargainers.
Researchers from The Harvard Negotiation Project recommend that negotiators explore a number of alternatives to the problems they face in order to reach the best solution, but this is often not the case (as when you may be dealing with an individual using soft or hard bargaining tactics) (Forsyth, 2010).

Tactics
Tactics are always an important part of the negotiating process. More often than not they are subtle, difficult to identify and used for multiple purposes. Tactics are more frequently used in distributive negotiations and when the focus in on taking as much value off the table as possible. [18] Many negotiation tactics exist. Below are a few commonly used tactics.
Auction: The bidding process is designed to create competition. [19] When multiple parties want the same thing, pit them against one another. When people know that they may lose out on something, they want it even more. Not only do they want the thing that is being bid on, they also want to win, just to win. Taking advantage of someone's competitive nature can drive up the price.
Brinksmanship: One party aggressively pursues a set of terms to the point where the other negotiating party must either agree or walk away. Brinkmanship is a type of "hard nut" approach to bargaining in which one party pushes the other party to the "brink" or edge of what that party is willing to accommodate. Successful brinksmanship convinces the other party they have no choice but to accept the offer and there is no acceptable alternative to the proposed agreement. [20]
Bogey: Negotiators use the bogey tactic to pretend that an issue of little or no importance is very important. [21] Then, later in the negotiation, the issue can be traded for a major concession of actual importance.
Chicken: Negotiators propose extreme measures, often bluffs, to force the other party to chicken out and give them what they want. This tactic can be dangerous when parties are unwilling to back down and go through with the extreme measure.
Defence in Depth: Several layers of decision-making authority is used to allow further concessions each time the agreement goes through a different level of authority. [22] In other words, each time the offer goes to a decision maker, that decision maker asks to add another concession to close the deal.
Deadlines: Give the other party a deadline forcing them to make a decision. This method uses time to apply pressure to the other party. Deadlines given can be actual or artificial.
Flinch: Flinching is showing a strong negative physical reaction to a proposal. Common examples of flinching are gasping for air, or a visible expression of surprise or shock. The flinch can be done consciously or unconsciously. [23] The flinch signals to the opposite party that you think the offer or proposal is absurd in hopes the other party will lower their aspirations. [24] Seeing a physical reaction is more believable than hearing someone saying, "I'm shocked."
Good Guy/Bad Guy: The good guy/bad guy approach is typically used in team negotiations where one member of the team makes extreme or unreasonable demands, and the other offers a more rational approach. [25] This tactic is named after a police interrogation technique often portrayed in the media. The "good guy" appears more reasonable and understanding, and therefore, easier to work with. In essence, it is using the law of relativity to attract cooperation. The "good guy" appears more agreeable relative than the "bad guy."
Highball/Lowball: Depending on whether selling or buying, sellers or buyers use a ridiculously high, or ridiculously low opening offer that is not achievable. The theory is that the extreme offer makes the other party reevaluate their own opening offer and move close to the resistance point (as far as you are willing to go to reach an agreement). [25] Another advantage is that the party giving the extreme demand appears more flexible when they make concessions toward a more reasonable outcome. A danger of this tactic is that the opposite party may think negotiating is a waste of time.
The Nibble: Nibbling is asking for proportionally small concessions that haven't been discussed previously just before closing the deal. [21] This method takes advantage of the other party's desire to close by adding "just one more thing."
Snow Job: Negotiators overwhelm the other party with so much information that they have difficulty determining what information is important, and what is a diversion. [26] Negotiators may also use technical language or jargon to mask a simple answer to a question asked by a non-expert.
Mirroring: When people get on well, the outcome of a negotiation is likely to be more positive. To create trust and a rapport, a negotiator may mimic or mirror the opponent's behavior and repeat what they say. Mirroring refers to a person repeating the core content of what another person just said, or repeating a certain expression. It indicates attention to the subject of negotiation and acknowledges the other party's point or statement. [27] Mirroring can help create trust and establish a relationship.
Scotting: A tactic of lowering one's voice to create a position of power. This technique was pioneered by a veteran businessman, M. G. Scott, and saw tremendous success in railway machinery price negotiations. [28]

Nonverbal communication
Communication is a key element of negotiation. Effective negotiation requires that participants effectively convey and interpret information. Participants in a negotiation communicate information not only verbally but non-verbally through body language and gestures. By understanding how nonverbal communication works, a negotiator is better equipped to interpret the information other participants are leaking non-verbally while keeping secret those things that would inhibit his/her ability to negotiate. [29]

Examples
Non-verbal "anchoring" In a negotiation, a person can gain the advantage by verbally expressing a position first. By anchoring one's position, one establishes the position from which the negotiation proceeds. In a like manner, one can "anchor" and gain advantage with nonverbal (body language) cues.
Reading non-verbal communication Being able to read the non-verbal communication of another person can significantly aid in the communication process. By being aware of inconsistencies between a person's verbal and non-verbal communication and reconciling them, negotiators can to come to better resolutions. Examples of incongruity in body language include:
Conveying receptivity
The way negotiation partners position their bodies relative to each other may influence how receptive each is to the other person's message and ideas.
Receptive negotiators tend to appear relaxed with their hands open and palms visibly displayed. [33] [ page needed ]

Barriers

Emotion
Emotions play an important part in the negotiation process, although it is only in recent years that their effect is being studied. Emotions have the potential to play either a positive or negative role in negotiation. During negotiations, the decision as to whether or not to settle rests in part on emotional factors. Negative emotions can cause intense and even irrational behavior, and can cause conflicts to escalate and negotiations to break down, but may be instrumental in attaining concessions. On the other hand, positive emotions often facilitate reaching an agreement and help to maximize joint gains, but can also be instrumental in attaining concessions. Positive and negative discrete emotions can be strategically displayed to influence task and relational outcomes [35] and may play out differently across cultural boundaries. [36]

Affect effect
Dispositional affects affect various stages of negotiation: which strategies to use, which strategies are actually chosen, [37] the way the other party and their intentions are perceived, [38] their willingness to reach an agreement and the final negotiated outcomes. [39] Positive affectivity (PA) and negative affectivity (NA) of one or more of the negotiating sides can lead to very different outcomes.

Positive affect
Even before the negotiation process starts, people in a positive mood have more confidence, [40] and higher tendencies to plan to use a cooperative strategy. [37] During the negotiation, negotiators who are in a positive mood tend to enjoy the interaction more, show less contentious behavior, use less aggressive tactics [41] and more cooperative strategies. [37] This in turn increases the likelihood that parties will reach their instrumental goals, and enhance the ability to find integrative gains. [42] Indeed, compared with negotiators with negative or natural affectivity, negotiators with positive affectivity reached more agreements and tended to honor those agreements more. [37] Those favorable outcomes are due to better decision making processes, such as flexible thinking, creative problem solving , respect for others' perspectives, willingness to take risks and higher confidence. [43] Post-negotiation positive affect has beneficial consequences as well. It increases satisfaction with achieved outcome and influences one's desire for future interactions. [43] The PA aroused by reaching an agreement facilitates the dyadic relationship, which brings commitment that sets the stage for subsequent interactions. [43] PA also has its drawbacks: it distorts perception of self performance, such that performance is judged to be relatively better than it actually is. [40] Thus, studies involving self reports on achieved outcomes might be biased.

Negative affect
Negative affect has detrimental effects on various stages in the negotiation process. Although various negative emotions affect negotiation outcomes, by far the most researched is anger . Angry negotiators plan to use more competitive strategies and to cooperate less, even before the negotiation starts. [37] These competitive strategies are related to reduced joint outcomes. During negotiations, anger disrupts the process by reducing the level of trust, clouding parties' judgment, narrowing parties' focus of attention and changing their central goal from reaching agreement to retaliating against the other side. [41] Angry negotiators pay less attention to opponent's interests and are less accurate in judging their interests, thus achieve lower joint gains. [44] Moreover, because anger makes negotiators more self-centered in their preferences, it increases the likelihood that they will reject profitable offers. [41] Opponents who get really angry (or cry, or otherwise lose control) are more likely to make errors: make sure they are in your favor. [11] Anger does not help achieve negotiation goals either: it reduces joint gains [37] and does not boost personal gains, as angry negotiators do not succeed. [44] Moreover, negative emotions lead to acceptance of settlements that are not in the positive utility function but rather have a negative utility . [45] However, expression of negative emotions during negotiation can sometimes be beneficial: legitimately expressed anger can be an effective way to show one's commitment, sincerity, and needs. [41] Moreover, although NA reduces gains in integrative tasks, it is a better strategy than PA in distributive tasks (such as zero-sum ). [43] In his work on negative affect arousal and white noise, Seidner found support for the existence of a negative affect arousal mechanism through observations regarding the devaluation of speakers from other ethnic origins." Negotiation may be negatively affected, in turn, by submerged hostility toward an ethnic or gender group. [46]

Conditions for emotion affect
Research indicates that negotiator's emotions do not necessarily affect the negotiation process. Albarracın et al. (2003) suggested that there are two conditions for emotional affect, both related to the ability (presence of environmental or cognitive disturbances) and the motivation:
According to this model, emotions affect negotiations only when one is high and the other is low. When both ability and motivation are low, the affect is identified, and when both are high the affect is identified but discounted as irrelevant to judgment. [47] A possible implication of this model is, for example, that the positive effects PA has on negotiations (as described above) is seen only when either motivation or ability are low.

Effect of partner's emotions
Most studies on emotion in negotiations focus on the effect of the negotiator's own emotions on the process. However, what the other party feels might be just as important, as group emotions are known to affect processes both at the group and the personal levels. When it comes to negotiations, trust in the other party is a necessary condition for its emotion to affect, [38] and visibility enhances the effect. [42] Emotions contribute to negotiation processes by signaling what one feels and thinks and can thus prevent the other party from engaging in destructive behaviors and to indicate what steps should be taken next: PA signals to keep in the same way, while NA points that mental or behavioral adjustments are needed. [43] Partner's emotions can have two basic effects on negotiator's emotions and behavior: mimetic/ reciprocal or complementary. [39] For example, disappointment or sadness might lead to compassion and more cooperation. [43] In a study by Butt et al. (2005) that simulated real multi-phase negotiation, most people reacted to the partner's emotions in reciprocal, rather than complementary, manner. Specific emotions were found to have different effects on the opponent's feelings and strategies chosen:

Dealing with emotions

Problems with laboratory studies
Negotiation is a rather complex interaction . Capturing all its complexity is a very difficult task, let alone isolating and controlling only certain aspects of it. For this reason most negotiation studies are done under laboratory conditions, and focus only on some aspects. Although lab studies have their advantages, they do have major drawbacks when studying emotions:

Group composition

Multi-party
While negotiations involving more than two parties is less often researched, some results from two-party negotiations still apply with more than two parties. One such result is that in negotiations it is common to see language similarity arise between the two negotiating parties. In three-party negotiations, language similarity still arose, and results were particularly efficient when the party with the most to gain from the negotiation adopted language similarities from the other parties. [50]

Team
Due to globalization and growing business trends, negotiation in the form of teams is becoming widely adopted. Teams can effectively collaborate to break down a complex negotiation. There is more knowledge and wisdom dispersed in a team than in a single mind. Writing, listening, and talking, are specific roles team members must satisfy. The capacity base of a team reduces the amount of blunder, and increases familiarity in a negotiation. [51]
However, unless a team can appropriately utilize the full capacity of its potential, effectiveness can suffer. One factor in the effectiveness of team negotiation is a problem that occurs through solidarity behavior. Solidarity behavior occurs when one team member reduces his or her own utility (benefit) in order to increase the benefits of other team members. This behavior is likely to occur when interest conflicts rise. When the utility/needs of the negotiation opponent does not align with every team member's interests, team members begin to make concessions and balance the benefits gained among the team. [52]
Intuitively, this may feel like a cooperative approach. However, though a team may aim to negotiate in a cooperative or collaborative nature, the outcome may be less successful than is possible, especially when integration is possible. Integrative potential is possible when different negotiation issues are of different importance to each team member. Integrative potential is often missed due to the lack of awareness of each member's interests and preferences. Ultimately, this leads to a poorer negotiation result.
Thus, a team can perform more effectively if each member discloses his or her preferences prior to the negotiation. This step will allow the team to recognize and organize the team's joint priorities, which they can take into consideration when engaging with the opposing negotiation party. Because a team is more likely to discuss shared information and common interests, teams must make an active effort to foster and incorporate unique viewpoints from experts from different fields. Research by Daniel Thiemann, which largely focused on computer-supported collaborative tasks, found that the Preference Awareness method is an effective tool for fostering the knowledge about joint priorities and further helps the team judge which negotiation issues were of highest importance. [53]

Women
Many of the strategies in negotiation vary across genders, and this leads to variations in outcomes for different genders, often with women experiencing less success in negotiations as a consequence. This is due to a number of factors, including that it has been shown that it is more difficult for women to be self-advocating when they are negotiating. Many of the implications of these findings have strong financial impacts in addition to the social backlash faced by self-advocating women in negotiations, as compared to other advocating women, self-advocating men, and other advocating men. Research in this area has been studied across platforms, in addition to more specific areas like women as physician assistants. [54] The backlash associated with this type of behavior is attributed to the fact that to be self-advocated is considered masculine, whereas the alternative, being accommodating, is considered more feminine. [55] Males, however, do not appear to face any type of backlash for not being self-advocating. [56]
This research has been supported by multiple studies, including one which evaluated candidates participating in a negotiation regarding compensation. This study showed that women who initiated negotiations were evaluated more poorly than men who initiated negotiations. In another variation of this particular setup, men and women evaluated videos of men and women either accepting a compensation package or initiating negotiations. Men evaluated women more poorly for initiating negotiations, while women evaluated both men and women more poorly for initiating negotiations. In this particular experiment, women were less likely to initiate a negotiation with a male, citing nervousness, but there was no variation with the negotiation was initiated with another female. [57]
Research also supports the notion that the way individuals respond in a negotiation varies depending on the gender of the opposite party. In all-male groups, the use of deception showed no variation upon the level of trust between negotiating parties, however in mixed-sex groups there was an increase in deceptive tactics when it was perceived that the opposite party was using an accommodating strategy. In all-female groups, there were many shifts in when individuals did and did not employ deception in their negotiation tactics. [55]

Etymology
The word "negotiation" originated in the early 15th century from the Old French and Latin expressions "negociacion" and "negotiationem". These terms mean "business, trade and traffic". By the late 1590s negotiation had the definition, "to communicate in search of mutual agreement." With this new introduction and this meaning, it showed a shift in "doing business" to "bargaining about" business. [58]

Bone tumor
A bone tumor (also spelled bone tumour ) is a neoplastic growth of tissue in bone . Abnormal growths found in the bone can be either benign (noncancerous) or malignant (cancerous).
Average five-year survival in the United States after being diagnosed with bone and joint cancer is 67%. [1]

Classification
Bone tumors may be classified as " primary tumors ", which originate in bone or from bone-derived cells and tissues, and " secondary tumors " which originate in other sites and spread ( metastasize ) to the skeleton. Carcinomas of the prostate , breasts , lungs , thyroid , and kidneys are the carcinomas that most commonly metastasize to bone. Secondary malignant bone tumors are estimated to be 50 to 100 times as common as primary bone cancers.

Primary bone tumors
Primary tumors of bone can be divided into benign tumors and cancers . Common benign bone tumors may be neoplastic , developmental, traumatic , infectious , or inflammatory in etiology. Some benign tumors are not true neoplasms, but rather, represent hamartomas , namely the osteochondroma . The most common locations for many primary tumors, both benign and malignant include the distal femur and proximal tibia (around the knee joint).
Examples of benign bone tumors include osteoma , osteoid osteoma , osteochondroma , osteoblastoma , enchondroma , giant cell tumor of bone , aneurysmal bone cyst , and fibrous dysplasia of bone .
Malignant primary bone tumors include osteosarcoma , chondrosarcoma , Ewing's sarcoma , fibrosarcoma , and other types.
While malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) - now generally called " pleomorphic undifferentiated sarcoma " - primary in bone is known to occur occasionally, [2] current paradigms tend to consider MFH a "wastebasket" diagnosis, and the current trend is toward using specialized studies (i.e. genetic and immunohistochemical tests) to classify these undifferentiated tumors into other tumor classes. Multiple myeloma is a hematologic cancer, originating in the bone marrow, which also frequently presents as one or more bone lesions.
Germ cell tumors , including teratoma , often present and originate in the midline of the sacrum, coccyx, or both. These sacrococcygeal teratomas are often relatively amenable to treatment.

Secondary bone tumors
Since, by definition, benign bone tumors do not metastasize, all secondary bone tumors are metastatic lesions which have spread from other organs, most commonly carcinomas of the breast, lung, and prostate.
Reliable and valid statistics on the incidence, prevalence, and mortality of malignant bone tumors are difficult to come by, particularly in the oldest (those over 75 years of age), because carcinomas that are widely metastatic to bone are rarely ever curable, biopsies to determine the origin of the tumor in cases like this are rarely done.

Symptoms
The most common symptom of bone tumors is pain , which will gradually increase over time. A person may go weeks, months, and sometimes years before seeking help; the pain increases with the growth of the tumor. Additional symptoms may include fatigue , fever , weight loss , anemia , and/or unexplained bone fractures. Many patients will not experience any symptoms, except for a painless mass. Some bone tumors may weaken the structure of the bone, causing pathologic fractures . [3]

Treatment
Treatment of bone tumors is highly dependent on the type of tumor.

Chemotherapy and radiotherapy
Chemotherapy and radiotherapy are effective in some tumors (such as Ewing's sarcoma ) but less so in others (such as chondrosarcoma ). [4] There is a variety of chemotherapy treatment protocols for bone tumors. The protocol with the best reported survival in children and adults is an intra-arterial protocol where tumor response is tracked by serial arteriogram. When tumor response has reached >90% necrosis surgical intervention is planned. [5] [6]

Medication
One of the major concerns is bone density and bone loss. Non-hormonal bisphosphonates increase bone strength and are available as once-a-week prescription pills. Metastron also known as strontium-89 chloride is an intravenous medication given to help with the pain and can be given in three month intervals. Generic Strontium Chloride Sr-89 Injection UPS, manufactured by Bio-Nucleonics Inc., it is the generic version of Metastron. [7] Astra zantec is currently under review as to the benefits in bone cancer.

Surgical treatment
Treatment for some bone cancers may involve surgery , such as limb amputation , or limb sparing surgery (often in combination with chemotherapy and radiation therapy ). Limb sparing surgery , or limb salvage surgery, means the limb is spared from amputation . Instead of amputation, the affected bone is removed and replaced in one of two ways: (a) bone graft , in which bone is taken from elsewhere on the body or (b) artificial bone is put in. In upper leg surgeries, limb salvage prostheses are available.
The other surgery is called Van Nes rotation or rotationplasty which is a form of amputation, in which the patient's foot is turned upwards in a 180 degree turn and the upturned foot is used as a knee.
Types of amputation:
The most radical of amputations is hemicorporectomy (translumbar or waist amputation) which removes the legs, the pelvis, urinary system, excretory system and the genital area (penis/testes in males and vagina/vulva in females). This operation is done in two stages. First stage is doing the colostomy and the urinary conduit, the second stage is the amputation. This is a mutilating operation and is only done as a last resort (e.g. when even pelvic exenteration does not work or in cases of advanced pelvic/reproductive cancers)

Thermal Ablation Techniques
Over the past two decades, CT guided radiofrequency ablation has emerged as a less invasive alternative to surgical resection in the care of benign bone tumors, most notably osteoid osteomas . In this technique, which can be performed under conscious sedation, a RF probe is introduced into the tumor nidus through a cannulated needle under CT guidance and heat is applied locally to destroy tumor cells. Since the procedure was first introduced for the treatment of osteoid osteomas in the early 1990s, [8] it has been shown in numerous studies to be less invasive and expensive, to result in less bone destruction and to have equivalent safety and efficacy to surgical techniques, with 66 to 96% of patients reporting freedom from symptoms. [9] [10] [11] While initial success rates with RFA are high, symptom recurrence after RFA treatment has been reported, with some studies demonstrating a recurrence rate similar to that of surgical treatment. [12]
Thermal ablation techniques are also increasingly being used in the palliative treatment of painful metastatic bone disease. Currently, external beam radiation therapy is the standard of care for patients with localized bone pain due to metastatic disease. Although the majority of patients experience complete or partial relief of pain following radiation therapy, the effect is not immediate and has been shown in some studies to be transient in more than half of patients. [13] For patients who are not eligible or do not respond to traditional therapies ( i.e. radiation therapy, chemotherapy, palliative surgery, bisphosphonates or analgesic medications), thermal ablation techniques have been explored as alternatives for pain reduction. Several multi-center clinical trials studying the efficacy of RFA in the treatment of moderate to severe pain in patients with metastatic bone disease have shown significant decreases in patient reported pain after treatment. [14] [15] These studies are limited however to patients with one or two metastatic sites; pain from multiple tumors can be difficult to localize for directed therapy. More recently, cryoablation has also been explored as a potentially effective alternative as the area of destruction created by this technique can be monitored more effectively by CT than RFA, a potential advantage when treating tumors adjacent to critical structures. [16]

Prognosis
The outlook depends on the type of tumor. The outcome is expected to be good for people with noncancerous (benign) tumors, although some types of benign tumors may eventually become cancerous (malignant). With malignant bone tumors that have not spread, most patients achieve a cure, but the cure rate depends on the type of cancer, location, size, and other factors.

Tosh.0
Tosh.0 ( / ˈ t ɒ ʃ ˌ p ɔɪ n t ˈ oʊ / TOSH point OH ) is an American television series hosted and produced by comedian Daniel Tosh , who provides commentary on online viral video clips, society, celebrities, and other parts of popular culture and stereotypes. It premiered in the United States on June 4, 2009 on Comedy Central . The tone is based on Tosh's deliberately offensive and controversial style of black comedy , observational comedy , satire , and sarcasm . The show has reached No. 1 ratings for its timeslot among men within the ages of 18–24, reaching millions of viewers at a time. [1]

History
Tosh.0 was launched to a similar demographic as E! 's Talk Soup (and its since-canceled derivative, G4 's Web Soup ), and of time-filling video mashups on late-night talk shows. [2] [3] [4] It launched at a time of the convergence of television, computers, video cameras, and Internet access—across all devices and across all walks of life. [2]
The show premiered on Comedy Central on June 4, 2009, starring stand-up comedy veteran Daniel Tosh . [5] The first season was a surprise hit, averaging more than one million viewers per episode. [6] [7] Within ten weeks of its premiere, Tosh.0 became the second-most-watched cable network show in its time slot among males aged 18–34, a sought-after advertising demographic . [1] [7]
The show was originally scheduled for only 10 episodes, but as its popularity increased, Comedy Central extended the first season to 16 episodes. [8] In December 2009, it was announced that Comedy Central had renewed the show for a full second season with 25 episodes, and the show has since been consistently renewed as of 2015 [update] . [9] [10] [11] [12] [13]
In 2015, the series was sold into syndication , to air on local stations in major US cities, and in other local markets for late-night weekend spots. [14] Syndication ad-sales and distribution were purchased by Debmar-Mercury and 20th Television .

Overview
Tosh.0 's low-cost production model is oriented upon viral video clips that are freely downloadable from the Internet and freely reusable via American fair use copyright laws, with host Daniel Tosh presenting from a chromakey virtual stage. [6] [15] Daniel Tosh says, "The [clip show] format had been tried a couple dozen times and failed. Our idea [was] to push it as far as we can and see what happens"; [15] and that the staff selects videos of "people whose lives were changed because of a 15-second clip". [6] Executive Producer Charlie Siskel said the show "[looks] at pop culture and all areas of life through the lens of the Internet". [6]
The video clips are primarily selected by the show's full-time researchers and validated "on a case-by-case basis" by Comedy Central’s standards and practices division. [6] Though reportedly approving 95% of all the show's submitted videos, [6] Tosh says this division is surprisingly unpredictable in both its approvals and disapprovals, [15] and that he's as surprised as the audience is at what the company allows on TV. [16] The range of selected clips includes spontaneous cuteness, whimsical performances, romance, accidents, exhibitionism , fetishism , surrealism , stunts, vomit, gore, and other acute bodily harm. [2] [15] Hank Stuever of The Washington Post says the show's decadent tone is formed around the values and maturity of its young adult target audience. [2]

Format
Each episode begins with a cold open of a viral video clip from the Internet. Presenting to a live studio audience seated before his virtual stage, Daniel Tosh makes jokes and commentary about that video, and about a selection of other viral videos and pictures. He may act as if he were commenting on a video sharing site such as YouTube , making as many jokes as possible in 20 seconds. [17] The final video in this section enters a "Video Breakdown" segment, where Tosh discusses the video's elements of action and themes.
Tosh may perform original short sketches related to or parodying these videos. For example, he displayed a video of a man attempting to climb a precariously homemade staircase of milk crates to reach a flagpole, resulting in a great fall with visibly broken bones. Tosh whimsically parodied the tragedy in a fully animated stylistic recreation of Nintendo's original Super Mario Bros. (1985) video game, starring himself as Mario within the game's madcap action of jumping over huge blocks and collecting treasure. [6]
The "Web Redemption" or "CeWEBrity Profile" segments additionally invite the stars of those videos directly onto Tosh.0 , where they are interviewed to explain and recreate the video's subject matter. The segment yields various blends of increased cuteness, humiliation, bullying, parody, black comedy , sympathy, or protectiveness in an attempt to explore and redeem the star and the subject matter. [2] For example, Tosh pretends to spend days trapped in an elevator with Nick White, whose actual 41 hours trapped in a New York elevator had been chronicled by The New Yorker [6] and posted on YouTube in 2008. [18] The "Web Reunion", "Web Remix", or "Web Investigation" segments are formatted similarly; the "Web Retreat" featured Tosh hiking with Paul Vasquez from the viral video Double Rainbow . [19]
Throughout the show, Tosh interacts directly with the live audience, inviting broadcast viewers to actively join his following of millions of Twitter users in "live tweeting" and to submit their own videos. [2] [6] [20] In the "Is it Racist?" segment, Tosh invites viewers to vote on any racial stereotypes presented in a video. In addition to garnering a reported average of 1,200 monthly death threats, [16] Tosh's ability to call the audience to action has yielded the mass vandalism of the show's own Wikipedia article, [21] and has resulted in traffic volumes that have temporarily crashed websites such as CelebrityNetWorth [22] [23] [24] [25] and Comedy Central. [26]
Tosh routinely utilizes the show's screen time for promotion of his stand-up comedy tours, merchandise, and other TV shows—prompting Forbes to describe the show as being "as much marketing [vehicle] as ... [moneymaker]". [4]

Reception

Viewership
The first season was a surprise hit, averaging more than one million viewers per episode. [6] [7] In June 2010, the season premiere was the #1 show on its timeslot among men aged 18–24. With nearly 2 million viewers, the episode was the most-watched episode of the series. [1] This record was quickly broken by the July 7 episode, which had up to 2.4 million viewers, and the July 28 episode would attract 2.7 million viewers, again winning the time slot and being the most-watched show on television that day among men aged 18–24 and 25–34. [15] The July 28 episode was the top cable show that night for adults 18–49. [6] [27] Within ten weeks of its premiere, Tosh.0 became the second-most-watched cable network show in its time slot among males aged 18–34, a sought-after advertising demographic . [1] [7] [15]
In June 2015, Forbes ranked the show's Twitter following of 17 million members as number 43 out of 100 on "The Social 100", its list of the most followed celebrities on Twitter. [28] In 2016, a New York Times study of the 50 TV shows with the most Facebook Likes found that Tosh.0 was "very much of a Northern show, but not necessarily an urban one. It is most popular in Colorado; least so in Mississippi". [29]

Critical reception
The show's core premise has been initially compared to that of the perceived competition of E! 's Talk Soup (and its since-canceled derivative, G4 's Web Soup ), The Dish , Sports Soup , [30] and of time-filling viral video mashups on late-night talk shows. [2] [3] [4] [15]
Hank Stuever of The Washington Post initially gave a mostly negative review of the June 4, 2009 debut episode of Tosh.0 . He found Tosh's stage execution to yield a banal, juvenile, and unnecessary "blooper show" serving as a "cheap example of clearinghouse programming" which adds little to a mashup of viral videos but "clutter, buttressed by a lot of stale references". Stuever thought the concept of the series had potential, concluding that Tosh can "hold his own" within the concept of redeeming the Internet and "undoing the fail". [31] Five years later, Stuever reevaluated the show positively as a now long-time fan, and addressed his retrospective regret of his "prematurely dismissive" impression by writing a new review to serve as "a long-delayed Valentine to [his] secret dirty love, Daniel Tosh". He describes Tosh's performance as being the essential self-rationalizing, misanthropic troll who personifies the audience's worst impulses in "a splendid act of pretending to be the guy who enters the world and immediately sets about disliking it". He describes the content as "a digest of shockingly funny, gross or embarrassing ... moments of terrible decisions and painful outcomes" and Tosh's highly rationalized tone of delivery as hilariously cruel, vicious, venomous, shocking, protective, and occasionally redemptive. Stuever says the show's decadent tone is formed around its target audience and its tentatively developing maturity level, "higher learning[, and] guiding set of ethics"—calling the show a good place to be, and to make fun of, "a-holes". [2] He describes Tosh.0 as "a TV show about the Internet, literally and thematically", with a hilarious use of cruelty "as black as the online soul, and as fleeting and ephemeral", yielding a "blundering exploration of race, class, gender, life". [2]
Kenny Herzog of The A. V. Club praised the show's "high-wire act of being hysterically vicious and accurate in mocking oblivious exhibitionists without purely bullying" and that the show's "strongest moments of pure hilarity come from its extended, performed material". He describes the show as "continually playing Steal the Bacon for unexploited scraps against the absorbent blob that is viral culture". [30]

The Times
The Times is a British daily (Monday to Saturday) national newspaper based in London, England. It began in 1785 under the title The Daily Universal Register , adopting its current name on 1 January 1788. The Times and its sister paper The Sunday Times (founded in 1821) are published by Times Newspapers, since 1981 a subsidiary of News UK , itself wholly owned by News Corp . The Times and The Sunday Times do not share editorial staff, were founded independently and have only had common ownership since 1967.
In 1959 the historian of journalism Allan Nevins analysed the importance of The Times in shaping the views of events of London's elite:
The Times is the first newspaper to have borne that name, lending it to numerous other papers around the world, including The Times of India (founded in 1838), The Straits Times (Singapore) (1845), The New York Times (1851), The Irish Times (1859), Le Temps (France) (1861-1942), the Cape Times (South Africa) (1872), the Los Angeles Times (1881), the Trenton Times (1882), The Seattle Times (1891), The Manila Times (1898), The Daily Times (Malawi) (1900), El Tiempo (Colombia) (1911), The Canberra Times (1926), Times of Malta (1935), and The Washington Times (1982). In these countries, the newspaper is often referred to as The London Times [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] or The Times of London , [9] although the newspaper is of national scope and distribution.
The Times is the originator of the widely used Times Roman typeface, originally developed by Stanley Morison of The Times in collaboration with the Monotype Corporation for its legibility in low-tech printing. In November 2006 The Times began printing headlines in a new font, Times Modern . The Times was printed in broadsheet format for 219 years, but switched to compact size in 2004 in an attempt to appeal more to younger readers and commuters using public transport. The Sunday Times remains a broadsheet.
The Times had an average daily circulation of 446,164 in December 2016; [2] in the same period, The Sunday Times had an average daily circulation of 792,210. [2] An American edition of The Times has been published since 6 June 2006. [10] It has been heavily used by scholars and researchers because of its widespread availability in libraries and its detailed index. A complete historical file of the digitised paper, up to 2010, is online from Gale Cengage Learning. [11] [12]

History

1785 to 1890
The Times was founded by publisher John Walter on 1 January 1785 as The Daily Universal Register , with Walter in the role of editor. Walter had lost his job by the end of 1784 after the insurance company where he was working went bankrupt because of the complaints of a Jamaican hurricane. Being unemployed, Walter decided to set a new business up. It was in that time when Henry Johnson invented the logography, a new typography that was faster and more precise (three years later, it was proved that it was not as efficient as had been said). Walter bought the logography's patent and to use it, he decided to open a printing house, where he would daily produce an advertising sheet. The first publication of the newspaper The Daily Universal Register in Great Britain was 1 January 1785. Unhappy because people always omitted the word Universal , Ellias changed the title after 940 editions on 1 January 1788 to The Times . [13] In 1803, Walter handed ownership and editorship to his son of the same name. Walter Sr had spent sixteen months in Newgate Prison for libel printed in The Times , but his pioneering efforts to obtain Continental news, especially from France, helped build the paper's reputation among policy makers and financiers.
The Times used contributions from significant figures in the fields of politics, science, literature, and the arts to build its reputation. For much of its early life, the profits of The Times were very large and the competition minimal, so it could pay far better than its rivals for information or writers. Beginning in 1814, the paper was printed on the new steam-driven cylinder press developed by Friedrich Koenig . [14] In 1815, The Times had a circulation of 5,000. [15]
Thomas Barnes was appointed general editor in 1817. In the same year, the paper's printer James Lawson, died and passed the business onto his son John Joseph Lawson(1802–1852). Under the editorship of Barnes and his successor in 1841, John Thadeus Delane , the influence of The Times rose to great heights, especially in politics and amongst the City of London . Peter Fraser and Edward Sterling were two noted journalists, and gained for The Times the pompous/satirical nickname 'The Thunderer' (from "We thundered out the other day an article on social and political reform."). The increased circulation and influence of the paper was based in part to its early adoption of the steam-driven rotary printing press. Distribution via steam trains to rapidly growing concentrations of urban populations helped ensure the profitability of the paper and its growing influence. [16]
The Times was the first newspaper to send war correspondents to cover particular conflicts. W. H. Russell , the paper's correspondent with the army in the Crimean War , was immensely influential [17] with his dispatches back to England.
In other events of the nineteenth century, The Times opposed the repeal of the Corn Laws until the number of demonstrations convinced the editorial board otherwise, and only reluctantly supported aid to victims of the Irish Potato Famine . It enthusiastically supported the Great Reform Bill of 1832 , which reduced corruption and increased the electorate from 400,000 people to 800,000 people (still a small minority of the population). During the American Civil War , The Times represented the view of the wealthy classes, favouring the secessionists, but it was not a supporter of slavery.
The third John Walter , the founder's grandson, succeeded his father in 1847. The paper continued as more or less independent, but from the 1850s The Times was beginning to suffer from the rise in competition from the penny press , notably The Daily Telegraph and The Morning Post .
During the 19th century, it was not infrequent for the Foreign Office to approach The Times and ask for continental intelligence, which was often superior to that conveyed by official sources. [ citation needed ]

1890 to 1981
The Times faced financial extinction in 1890 under Arthur Fraser Walter , but it was rescued by an energetic editor, Charles Frederic Moberly Bell . During his tenure (1890–1911), The Times became associated with selling the Encyclopædia Britannica using aggressive American marketing methods introduced by Horace Everett Hooper and his advertising executive, Henry Haxton. Due to legal fights between the Britannica's two owners, Hooper and Walter Montgomery Jackson , The Times severed its connection in 1908 and was bought by pioneering newspaper magnate, Alfred Harmsworth , later Lord Northcliffe.
In editorials published on 29 and 31 July 1914, Wickham Steed , the Times's Chief Editor, argued that the British Empire should enter World War I . [18] On 8 May 1920, also under the editorship of Steed , The Times in an editorial endorsed the anti-Semitic fabrication The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion as a genuine document, and called Jews the world's greatest danger. In the leader entitled "The Jewish Peril, a Disturbing Pamphlet: Call for Inquiry", Steed wrote about The Protocols of the Elders of Zion :
The following year, when Philip Graves , the Constantinople (modern Istanbul ) correspondent of The Times , exposed The Protocols as a forgery, The Times retracted the editorial of the previous year.
In 1922 John Jacob Astor , son of the 1st Viscount Astor , bought The Times from the Northcliffe estate . The paper gained a measure of notoriety in the 1930s with its advocacy of German appeasement ; editor Geoffrey Dawson was closely allied with those in the government who practised appeasement, most notably Neville Chamberlain .
Kim Philby , a double agent with primary allegiance to the Soviet Union , was a correspondent for the newspaper in Spain during the Spanish Civil War of the late 1930s. Philby was admired for his courage in obtaining high-quality reporting from the front lines of the bloody conflict. He later joined British Military Intelligence ( MI6 ) during World War II , was promoted into senior positions after the war ended, and defected to the Soviet Union when discovery was inevitable in 1963. [20]
Between 1941 and 1946 the left-wing British historian E. H. Carr was Assistant Editor. Carr was well known for the strongly pro-Soviet tone of his editorials. [21] In December 1944, when fighting broke out in Athens between the Greek Communist ELAS and the British Army, Carr in a Times leader sided with the Communists, leading Winston Churchill to condemn him and the article in a speech to the House of Commons. [22] As a result of Carr's editorial, The Times became popularly known during that stage of World War II as "the threepenny Daily Worker " (the price of the Communist Party's Daily Worker being one penny). [23]
On 3 May 1966 it resumed printing news on the front page – previously the front page had been given over to small advertisements, usually of interest to the moneyed classes in British society. Also in 1966, the Royal Arms , which had been a feature of the newspaper's masthead since its inception, was abandoned. [24] In 1967 members of the Astor family sold the paper to Canadian publishing magnate Roy Thomson . His Thomson Corporation brought it under the same ownership as The Sunday Times to form Times Newspapers Limited .
An industrial dispute prompted the management to shut the paper for nearly a year from 1 December 1978 to 12 November 1979. [25]
The Thomson Corporation management were struggling to run the business due to the 1979 energy crisis and union demands. Management sought a buyer who was in a position to guarantee the survival of both titles, and had the resources and was committed to funding the introduction of modern printing methods.
Several suitors appeared, including Robert Maxwell , Tiny Rowland and Lord Rothermere ; however, only one buyer was in a position to meet the full Thomson remit, Australian media magnate Rupert Murdoch. Robert Holmes à Court , another Australian magnate had previously tried to buy The Times in 1980.

From 1981
In 1981 The Times and The Sunday Times were bought from Thomson by Rupert Murdoch's News International . [26] The acquisition followed three weeks of intensive bargaining with the unions by company negotiators John Collier and Bill O'Neill . The Royal Arms was reintroduced to the masthead at about this time, but whereas previously it had been that of the reigning monarch, it would now be that of the House of Hanover , who were on the throne when the newspaper was founded.
After 14 years as editor, William Rees-Mogg resigned upon completion of the change of ownership. [27] Murdoch began to make his mark on the paper by appointing Harold Evans as his replacement. [28] One of his most important changes was the introduction of new technology and efficiency measures. Between March 1981 and May 1982, following agreement with print unions, the hot-metal Linotype printing process used to print The Times since the 19th century was phased out and replaced by computer input and photo-composition. This allowed print room staff at The Times and The Sunday Times to be reduced by half. However, direct input of text by journalists ("single-stroke" input) was still not achieved, and this was to remain an interim measure until the Wapping dispute of 1986, when The Times moved from New Printing House Square in Gray's Inn Road (near Fleet Street ) to new offices in Wapping . [29] [30]
Robert Fisk , [31] seven times British International Journalist of the Year, [32] resigned as foreign correspondent in 1988 over what he saw as "political censorship" of his article on the shooting-down of Iran Air Flight 655 in July 1988. He wrote in detail about his reasons for resigning from the paper due to meddling with his stories, and the paper's pro-Israel stance. [33]
In June 1990 The Times ceased its policy of using courtesy titles ("Mr", "Mrs", or "Miss" prefixes) for living persons before full names on first reference, but it continues to use them before surnames on subsequent references. The more formal style is now confined to the "Court and Social" page, though "Ms" is now acceptable in that section, as well as before surnames in news sections.
In November 2003 News International began producing the newspaper in both broadsheet and tabloid sizes. On 13 September 2004 the weekday broadsheet was withdrawn from sale in Northern Ireland . Since 1 November 2004, the paper has been printed solely in tabloid format.
On 6 June 2005 The Times redesigned its Letters page, dropping the practice of printing correspondents' full postal addresses. Published letters were long regarded as one of the paper's key constituents. Author/solicitor David Green of Castle Morris Pembrokeshire has had more letters published on the main letters page than any other known contributor – 158 by 31 January 2008. According to its leading article "From Our Own Correspondents", the reason for removal of full postal addresses was to fit more letters onto the page.
In a 2007 meeting with the House of Lords Select Committee on Communications, which was investigating media ownership and the news, Murdoch stated that the law and the independent board prevented him from exercising editorial control. [34]
In May 2008 printing of The Times switched from Wapping to new plants at Broxbourne on the outskirts of London, and Merseyside and Glasgow, enabling the paper to be produced with full colour on every page for the first time.
On 26 July 2012, to coincide with the official start of the London 2012 Olympics and the issuing of a series of souvenir front covers, The Times added the suffix "of London" to its masthead. [35]

Content
The Times features news for the first half of the paper, the Opinion/Comment section begins after the first news section with world news normally following this. The business pages begin on the centre spread, and are followed by The Register, containing obituaries, Court & Social section, and related material. The sport section is at the end of the main paper. In April 2016 the cover price of The Times became £1.40 on weekdays and £1.50 on Saturdays. [36]

Times2
The Times 's main supplement, every day, is the times2 , featuring various lifestyle columns. It was discontinued on 1 March 2010 but reintroduced on 11 October 2010 after discontinuation was criticised. Its regular features include a puzzles section called Mind Games . Its previous incarnation began on 5 September 2005, before which it was called T2 and previously Times 2 . Regular features include columns by a different columnist each weekday. There was a column by Marcus du Sautoy each Wednesday, for example. The back pages are devoted to puzzles and contain sudoku , " Killer Sudoku ", " KenKen ", word polygon puzzles, and a crossword simpler and more concise than the main "Times Crossword".
The supplement contains arts and lifestyle features, TV and radio listings and reviews.

The Game
The Game is included in the newspaper on Mondays, and details all the weekend's football activity ( Premier League and Football League Championship , League One and League Two. ) The Scottish edition of The Game also includes results and analysis from Scottish Premier League games. During the FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euros there is a daily supplement of The Game. During the summer where there is no international tournament there are no editions of this feature and the transfer window highlights are in the daily Sports section.

Saturday supplements
The Saturday edition of The Times contains a variety of supplements. These supplements were relaunched in January 2009 as: Sport , Weekend (including travel and lifestyle features), Saturday Review (arts, books, TV listings and ideas), The Times Magazine (columns on various topics), and Playlist (an entertainment listings guide).
The Times Magazine features columns touching on various subjects such as celebrities, fashion and beauty, food and drink, homes and gardens or simply writers' anecdotes. Notable contributors include Giles Coren , Food and Drink Writer of the Year in 2005 and Nadiya Hussain , winner of BBC's The Great British Bake Off .

Online presence
The Times and The Sunday Times have had an online presence since March 1999, originally at the-times.co.uk and sunday-times.co.uk , and later at timesonline.co.uk . [37] There are now two websites: thetimes.co.uk is aimed at daily readers, and the thesundaytimes.co.uk site at providing weekly magazine-like content. There are also iPad and Android editions of both newspapers. Since July 2010, News UK has required readers who do not subscribe to the print edition to pay £2 per week to read The Times and The Sunday Times online. [38]
The Times Digital Archive (1785–2008) is freely accessible via Gale databases to readers affiliated with subscribing academic , public , and school libraries.
Visits to the websites have decreased by 87% since the paywall was introduced, from 21 million unique users per month to 2.7 million. [39] In April 2009, the timesonline site had a readership of 750,000 readers per day. [40] In October 2011 there were around 111,000 subscribers to The Times ' digital products. [41]

Ownership
The Times has had the following eight owners since its foundation in 1785:

Readership
At the time of Harold Evans' appointment as editor in 1981, The Times had an average daily sale of 282,000 copies in comparison to the 1.4 million daily sales of its traditional rival The Daily Telegraph . [28] By November 2005 The Times sold an average of 691,283 copies per day, the second-highest of any British " quality " newspaper (after The Daily Telegraph , which had a circulation of 903,405 copies in the period), and the highest in terms of full-rate sales. [42] By March 2014, average daily circulation of The Times had fallen to 394,448 copies, [2] compared to The Daily Telegraph' s 523,048, [43] with the two retaining respectively the second-highest and highest circulations among British "quality" newspapers. In contrast The Sun , the highest-selling "tabloid" daily newspaper in the United Kingdom, sold an average of 2,069,809 copies in March 2014, [44] and the Daily Mail , the highest-selling "middle market" British daily newspaper, sold an average of 1,708,006 copies in the period. [45]
The Sunday Times has a significantly higher circulation than The Times , and sometimes outsells The Sunday Telegraph . In January 2013 The Times had a circulation of 399,339 [46] and The Sunday Times of 885,612. [47]
In a 2009 national readership survey The Times was found to have the highest number of ABC1 25–44 readers and the largest numbers of readers in London of any of the "quality" papers. [48]

Typeface
In 1908, The Times started using the Monotype Modern typeface. [50]
The Times commissioned the serif typeface Times New Roman , created by Victor Lardent at the English branch of Monotype , in 1931. [51] It was commissioned after Stanley Morison had written an article criticizing The Times for being badly printed and typographically antiquated. [52] The font was supervised by Morison and drawn by Victor Lardent, an artist from the advertising department of The Times . Morison used an older font named Plantin as the basis for his design, but made revisions for legibility and economy of space. Times New Roman made its debut in the issue of 3 October 1932. [53] After one year, the design was released for commercial sale. The Times stayed with Times New Roman for 40 years, but new production techniques and the format change from broadsheet to tabloid in 2004 have caused the newspaper to switch font five times since 1972. However, all the new fonts have been variants of the original New Roman font:

Political allegiance
Historically, the paper was not overtly pro- Tory or Whig , but has been a long time bastion of the English Establishment and empire. The Times adopted a stance described as "peculiarly detached" at the 1945 general election ; although it was increasingly critical of the Conservative Party's campaign, it did not advocate a vote for any one party. [57] However, the newspaper reverted to the Tories for the next election five years later. It supported the Conservatives for the subsequent three elections, followed by support for both the Conservatives and the Liberal Party for the next five elections, expressly supporting a Con-Lib coalition in 1974. The paper then backed the Conservatives solidly until 1997, when it declined to make any party endorsement but supported individual (primarily Eurosceptic ) candidates. [58]
For the 2001 general election The Times declared its support for Tony Blair 's Labour government, which was re-elected by a landslide (although not as large as in 1997). It supported Labour again in 2005 , when Labour achieved a third successive win, though with a reduced majority. [59] In 2004, according to MORI , the voting intentions of its readership were 40% for the Conservative Party, 29% for the Liberal Democrats , and 26% for Labour. [60] For the 2010 general election , the newspaper declared its support for the Conservatives once again; the election ended in the Tories taking the most votes and seats but having to form a coalition with the Liberal Democrats in order to form a government as they had failed to gain an overall majority. [61]
This makes it the most varied newspaper in terms of political support in British history. [62] Some columnists in The Times are connected to the Conservative Party such as Daniel Finkelstein , Tim Montgomerie , Matthew Parris and Matt Ridley , but there are also columnists connected to the Labour Party such as David Aaronovitch , Philip Collins , Oliver Kamm and Jenni Russell .
The Times occasionally makes endorsements for foreign elections. In November 2012, it endorsed a second term for Barack Obama although it also expressed reservations about his foreign policy. [63]
The Times , along with the British Film Institute , sponsors the "The Times" bfi London Film Festival . [64] It also sponsors the Cheltenham Literature Festival and the Asia House Festival of Asian Literature at Asia House , London.

In the dystopian future world of George Orwell 's Nineteen Eighty-Four , The Times has been transformed into the organ of the totalitarian ruling party, its editorials—of which several are quoted in the book—reflecting Big Brother 's pronouncements.
Rex Stout 's fictional detective Nero Wolfe is described as fond of solving the London Times ' crossword puzzle at his New York home, in preference to those of American papers.
In the James Bond series by Ian Fleming , James Bond , reads The Times . As described by Fleming in From Russia, with Love : " The Times was the only paper that Bond ever read." [71]
In The Wombles , Uncle Bulgaria read The Times and asked for the other Wombles to bring him any copies that they found amongst the litter. The newspaper played a central role in the episode Very Behind the Times (Series 2, Episode 12).

Wikispecies is a wiki -based online project supported by the Wikimedia Foundation . Its aim is to create a comprehensive free content catalogue of all species ; the project is directed at scientists, rather than at the general public. Jimmy Wales stated that editors are not required to fax in their degrees, but that submissions will have to pass muster with a technical audience. [1] [2] Wikispecies is available under the GNU Free Documentation License and CC BY-SA 3.0 .
Started in September 2004, with biologists across the world invited to contribute, [3] the project had grown a framework encompassing the Linnaean taxonomy with links to Wikipedia articles on individual species by April 2005. [2]

History
Benedikt Mandl co-ordinated the efforts of several people who are interested in getting involved with the project and contacted potential supporters in early summer 2004. Databases were evaluated and the administrators contacted, some of them have agreed on providing their data for Wikispecies. Mandl defined two major tasks:
Advantages and disadvantages were widely discussed by the wikimedia-I mailing list. The board of directors of the Wikimedia Foundation voted by 4 to 0 in favor of the establishment of a Wikispecies. The project was launched in August 2004 and is hosted at species.wikimedia.org. It was officially merged to a sister project of Wikimedia Foundation on September 14, 2004.

Chris Anderson (writer)
Chris Anderson (born July 9, 1961) [2] is a British-American author and entrepreneur. He was with The Economist for seven years before joining WIRED magazine in 2001, where he was the editor-in-chief until 2012. He is known for his 2004 article entitled The Long Tail ; which he later expanded into the 2006 book, The Long Tail: Why the Future of Business Is Selling Less of More . [3] He is the cofounder and current CEO of 3D Robotics , a drone manufacturing company. [4]

Life and work

Early life
Anderson was born in London . His family moved to the United States, when he was five. [1] He enrolled for a degree program in physics from George Washington University and went on to study quantum mechanics and science journalism at the University of California, Berkeley . [5] He later did research at Los Alamos National Laboratory .

Career
He began his career with a six-year period as editor at the two scientific journals, Nature and Science . He then joined The Economist in 1994, where he remained for seven years, during which time he was stationed in London, Hong Kong and New York City in various positions, ranging from Technology Editor to US Business Editor. He took over as editor of WIRED in 2001.
His 2004 article The Long Tail in WIRED was expanded into a book in 2006, titled, The Long Tail: Why the Future of Business Is Selling Less of More . [3] [6] It appeared on the New York Times Nonfiction Best Sellers list. The book argues that products in low demand or that have a low sales volume can collectively build a better market share than its rivals, or exceed the relatively few current bestsellers and blockbusters, provided the store or distribution channel is large enough.
His next book, entitled Free: The Future of a Radical Price (2009) examines the advantages of a strategy where products and services are initially given to customers for free, and how businesses can profit more in the long run. [7] [8] [9] Anderson was accused of plagiarizing content from English Wikipedia for his book. [10] Anderson responded that he had disagreements with the criticism, and reasoned that the mention of citations were avoided due to the changing nature of content in English Wikipedia. However, the whole episode led him to integrate footnotes into the text, [11] and the digital editions of Free were corrected with the revision. Free debuted as #12 on the New York Times Best Seller List. [12] It was also available as a free download for a limited time, and an estimated 200,000 to 300,000 digital copies were downloaded in the first two weeks. [12] The unabridged audiobook remains free. [13]
Anderson's third book, Makers: The New Industrial Revolution (2012), was based on his 2010 article, "Atoms Are the New Bits". [14] The book describes how entrepreneurs using open source design, and 3D printing as a platform for driving resurgence of American manufacturing. [15] The ideas he portrayed; such as crowdsourcing of ideas , utilization of available lower-cost design and manufacturing tools, and reviewing options to outsource capital-intensive manufacturing were highlighted in the February 2012 Harvard Business Review article, "From Do It Yourself to Do It Together". [16]
Anderson was featured and interviewed on The Amp Hour radio show in episode #105 – An Interview with Chris Anderson – Deambulatory Daedal Drones, where he discusses his career, books, and the hardware and drone industry. [17]

Ventures
In 2007, Anderson founded GeekDad , a do-it-yourself blog that later became part of Wired.com. He was the editor until the role was handed over to Ken Denmead, and he now serves as editor emeritus of GeekDad. [18] The same year, Anderson founded Booktour.com, a free online service that connected authors on tour with audiences. In September 2011, Booktour.com folded. [19]
In October 2007, Anderson, who has been described as an "aerial-reconnaissance enthusiast," flew a remote-controlled aircraft allegedly equipped with a camera over Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory , causing security concerns when the aircraft crashed into a tree. [20] The enthusiasm turned inspiration for co-founding 3D Robotics , a 2009 robotics manufacturing spin-off of the DIYdrones.com [21] 3D Robotics produces the Ardupilot series of autopilots, which are based on the Arduino platform.
In May 2007, Anderson was featured as one of the top 100 thinkers in Time Magazine ' s annual list for 2007. [22]

Personal life
Anderson currently lives in Berkeley , California , with his wife and five children. . [23] He met his wife while working at the scientific journal, Nature . He has dual U.S.-U.K. citizenship. [1]

Kathryn Hughes
Kathryn Hughes (born 1959) is a British journalist and biographer. Educated at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford University and the University of East Anglia ; [1] her doctorate in Victorian history [2] was developed into her first book, The Victorian Governess . She is the Director of Creative Non-Fiction at the University of East Anglia , [3] [4]
Hughes' book George Eliot: The Last Victorian was awarded the 1999 James Tait Black Memorial Prize for biography, and her 2005 biography of Isabella Beeton , The Short Life and Long Times of Mrs Beeton was also well-received, [5] and made the long list for the Samuel Johnson Prize . [6] (Hughes's UEA website stated that the book had made the shortlist, but this turned out not to be true). Reviewing Mrs Beeton in the UK daily newspaper The Independent , Frances Spalding wrote: "There is seemingly no aspect of Victorian life that Kathryn Hughes cannot assimilate and understand from the inside. This is living history, in which massive research and impeccable scholarship is handled with invigorating panache". [7]

Entity linking
In natural language processing , entity linking , named entity linking (NEL), [1] named entity disambiguation (NED), named entity recognition and disambiguation (NERD) or named entity normalization ( NEN ) [2] is the task of determining the identity of entities mentioned in text. For example, given the sentence "Paris is the capital of France", the idea is to determine that "Paris" refers to the city of Paris and not to Paris Hilton or any other entity that could be referred as "Paris". NED is different from named entity recognition (NER) in that NER identifies the occurrence or mention of a named entity in text but it does not identify which specific entity it is.
Entity linking requires a knowledge base containing the entities to which entity mentions can be linked. A popular choice for entity linking on open domain text are knowledge-bases based on Wikipedia , [2] [3] in which each page is regarded as a named entity. NED using Wikipedia entities has been also called wikification (see Wikify! an early entity linking system [4] ). A knowledge base may also be induced automatically from training text [5] or manually built. [6]
Named entity mentions can be highly ambiguous, any entity linking method must address this inherent ambiguity . Various approaches to tackle this problem have been tried to date. In the seminal approach of Milne and Witten, supervised learning is employed using the anchor texts of Wikipedia entities as training data. [7] Kulkarni et al. exploited the common property that topically coherent documents refer to entities belonging to strongly related types. [8] Other approaches also collected training data based on unambiguous synonyms. [9]
Entity linking has been used to improve the performance of information retrieval systems [2] and to improve search performance on digital libraries. [10] [11] NED is also a key input for Semantic Search. [12] For example, entity linking has been successfully used to validate the output of Named-entity recognition methods by using an underlying assumption that every text has a specific scope and context, and therefore entities mentioned in that text should have a semantic relationship between them. [13] Semantic similarity measures can then be used to filter out errors by identifying entities out of context, even when multiple interpretations are possible for the same entity.
Entity Linking evaluation campaigns are organized by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) in the context of the Knowledge Base Population task of the Text Analysis Conference.

Toulouse
Toulouse ( UK / t uː ˈ l uː z / ; [4] French pronunciation: [tu.luz] ( listen ) locally: [tuˈluzə] ( listen ) ; Occitan : Tolosa [tuˈluzɔ] , Latin : Tolosa ) is the capital city of the southwestern French department of Haute-Garonne , as well as of the Occitanie region . The city lies on the banks of the River Garonne , 150 kilometres (93 miles) from the Mediterranean Sea, 230 km (143 mi) from the Atlantic Ocean, and 680 km (420 mi) from Paris. It is the fourth-largest city in France with 466,297 inhabitants in January 2014. The Toulouse Metro area is, with 1 312 304 inhabitants as of 2014, France's 4th metropolitan area after Paris, Lyon and Marseille and ahead of Lille and Bordeaux.
Toulouse is the centre of the European aerospace industry, with the headquarters of Airbus , the Galileo positioning system , the SPOT satellite system , the Airbus Group (former EADS ), ATR and the Aerospace Valley . It also hosts the European headquarters of Intel and CNES 's Toulouse Space Centre (CST), the largest space centre in Europe. [5] Thales Alenia Space , and Astrium Satellites also have a significant presence in Toulouse. The University of Toulouse is one of the oldest in Europe (founded in 1229) and, with more than 103,000 students, is the fourth-largest university campus in France, after the Universities of Paris , Lyon and Lille . [6]
The air route between Toulouse Blagnac and Paris Orly is the busiest in Europe, transporting 2.4 million passengers in 2014. [7] According to the rankings of L'Express and Challenges , Toulouse is the most dynamic French city. [8] [9] [10]
The city was the capital of the Visigothic Kingdom in the 5th century and the capital of the province of Languedoc in the late Middle Ages and early modern period (provinces were abolished during the French Revolution ), making it the unofficial capital of the cultural region of Occitania (Southern France). It is now the capital of the Occitanie region , the largest region in metropolitan France.
A city with unique architecture made of pinkish terracotta bricks, which earned it the nickname la Ville Rose ("the Pink City"), Toulouse counts two UNESCO World Heritage Sites , the Canal du Midi (designated in 1996 and shared with other cities), and the Basilica of St. Sernin , the largest remaining Romanesque building in Europe, [11] designated in 1998 because of its significance to the Santiago de Compostela pilgrimage route .

Geography
Toulouse is in the south of France, north of the department of Haute-Garonne, on the axis of communication between the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean.

Hydrography
The city is traversed by the Canal de Brienne , the Canal du Midi and the rivers Garonne , Touch and Hers-Mort .

Climate
Toulouse has a humid subtropical climate (borderline Cfb/Cfa in the Köppen climate classification ) which can be qualified as "submediterranean" due to its proximity to the Mediterranean climate zone.

History

Early history
The Garonne Valley was a central point for trade between the Pyrenees, the Mediterranean and the Atlantic since at least the Iron Age . The historical name of the city, Tolosa (Τώλοσσα in Greek , and of its inhabitants, the Tolosates , first recorded in the 2nd century BC), it is of unknown meaning or origin, possibly from Aquitanian , or from Iberian , [15] but has also been connected to the name of the Gaulish Volcae Tectosages . [16]
Tolosa enters the historical period in the 2nd century BC, when it became a Roman military outpost. After the conquest of Gaul , it was developed as a Roman city of Gallia Narbonensis . In the 5th century, Tolosa fell to the Visigothic kingdom and became one of its major cities, in the early 6th century even serving as its capital, before it fell to the Franks under Clovis in 507 ( Battle of Vouillé ). From this time, Toulouse was the capital of Aquitaine within the Frankish realm.
In 721, Duke Odo of Aquitaine defeated an invading Umayyad Muslim army at the Battle of Toulouse . Odo's victory was a small obstacle to Muslim expansion into Christian Europe , and Muslims finally occupied a large territory including Poitiers. Charles Martel , a decade later, won the Battle of Tours , also called the Battle of Poitiers.
The Frankish conquest of Septimania followed in the 750s, and a quasi-independent County of Toulouse emerged within the Carolingian sub-kingdom of Aquitaine by the late 8th century. The Battle of Toulouse of 844 , pitting Charles the Bald against Pepin II of Aquitaine , was key in the Carolingian Civil War.

County of Toulouse
During the Carolingian era , the town rose in status, becoming the capital of the County of Toulouse .
In the 12th century, consuls took over the running of the town and these proved to be difficult years. In particular, it was a time of religious turmoil. In Toulouse, the Cathars tried to set up a community here, but were routed by Simon de Montfort's troops. [17] The subsequent arrival of the Inquisition led to a period of religious fervour during which time the Dominican Couvent des Jacobins was founded. Governed by Raimond II and a group of city nobles, Toulouse's urban boundaries stretched beyond its walls to the north and as far south as Saint Michel. [ citation needed ]
In the Treaty of Paris of 1229, Toulouse formally submitted to the crown of France. The county's sole heiress Joan was engaged to Alphonse, Count of Poitiers , a younger brother of Louis IX of France . The marriage became legal in 1241, but it remained childless so that after Joan's death the county fell to the crown of France by inheritance. Also in 1229, University of Toulouse was established after the Parisian model , intended as a means to dissolve the heretic movement. [ citation needed ]
Various monastic orders, like the congregation of the order of frères prêcheurs , were started. They found home in Les Jacobins . [ citation needed ] In parallel, a long period of inquisition began inside the Toulouse walls. The fear of repression obliged the notabilities to exile, or to convert themselves. The inquisition lasted nearly 400 years, making Toulouse its capital. Count Raimond VII was convicted of heresy and died in 1249 without an heir. [ citation needed ]

Within the Kingdom of France
In 1271, Toulouse was incorporated into the kingdom of France and declared a " royal city ". With this accolade, it started to transform itself into an intellectual and artistic centre. [ citation needed ] In 1323 the Consistori del Gay Saber was established in Toulouse to preserve the lyric art of the troubadours . Toulouse became the centre of Occitan literary culture for the next hundred years; the Consistori was last active in 1484. [ citation needed ]
But the 14th century was to mark a downturn in the city's fortunes. First came a pogrom against Toulouse's Jewish population by Crusaders in 1320, [18] then, in 1348, the Black Death , then the Hundred Years' War . Famine and floods also took their toll on the city. Despite strong immigration, the population lost 10,000 inhabitants in 70 years. By 1405 Toulouse had only 19,000 people. [19]
It was not until the 15th century that Toulouse started to prosper. [20] Reinforcing its place as an administrative center, the city grew richer, participating in the trade of Bordeaux wine with England, as well as cereals and textiles. A parliament was set up by Charles VII and the city's merchants grew ever wealthier. Their economic well-being was mostly based on a plant-based blue dye known as pastel , made from woad , which they exported throughout Europe. These pastel merchants built grand town houses and, before long, both architecture and the fine arts flourished in the city as never before. [21]
The bubble finally burst in the mid-16th century. Another blue dye arrived from India, known as indigo . It wiped out the pastel trade in one fell swoop. Religious conflict broke out between the Catholics and the Protestant Calvinists . At the same time, buildings were destroyed by fire and there were yet more outbreaks of famine and plague.
In 1761, a Toulouse merchant, Jean Calas , was accused of murdering his own son to prevent his conversion to Catholicism. Calas was put to death a year later. Toulouse's persecution of Protestants such as Calas was widely condemned and religious intolerance did gradually disappear. [ citation needed ]
During the remainder of the 18th century, the city was slowly modernised. This included a period of urban rebuilding, which began in earnest from 1750. New projects included the building of the Jardin Royal. The Grand Rond also dates to this period, along with the Canal de Brienne and the Quai Dillon.

Within the French Republic
The Battle of Toulouse (1814) was one of the final battles of the Napoleonic Wars , four days after Napoleon's surrender of the French Empire to the nations of the Sixth Coalition . Toulouse, the regional capital, proved stoutly defended by Marshal Soult .
In 1856, the Matabiau Station was opened, launching a new age in transportation. Other transport improvements included the widening of streets to form more spacious boulevards. Gradually, Toulouse emerged as a modern French city.
During the early decades of the 20th century, Toulouse witnessed the mass arrival of immigrants from northern France, Italy and Spain. New industries were developed in the city, including aircraft and chemical manufacturing. The French airmail service was set up here as well. During the Second World War , Toulouse played a vital role in the Resistance movement.
In the 1960s, a new wave of immigrants arrived in the city, this time from Algeria. New homes were built and the city's boundaries were extended. Toulouse's industry interests have more recently expanded to include space exploration and electronics. Today, it is France's fourth-largest city.

Population
The population of the city proper (French: commune ) was 466,297 at the January 2014 census, [1] with 1,312,304 inhabitants in the metropolitan area (within the 2010 borders of the metropolitan area), up from 1,169,865 at the January 2006 census (within the same 2010 borders of the metropolitan area). [3] Thus, the metropolitan area registered a population growth rate of +1.34% per year between 2006 and 2011, the highest growth rate of any French metropolitan area larger than 500,000 inhabitants, although it is slightly lower than the growth rate registered between the 1999 and 2006 censuses.
Toulouse is the fourth largest city in France, after Paris, Marseille and Lyon , and the fourth-largest metropolitan area after Paris, Lyon, and Marseille.
Fueled by booming aerospace and high-tech industries, population growth of +1.49% a year in the metropolitan area in the 1990s (compared with +0.37% for metropolitan France ), and a record +1.87% a year in the early 2000s (+0.68% for metropolitan France), which is the highest population growth of any French metropolitan area larger than 500,000 inhabitants, means the Toulouse metropolitan area overtook Lille as the fourth-largest metropolitan area of France at the 2006 census.
A local Jewish group estimates there are about 2,500 Jewish families in Toulouse. A Muslim association has estimated there are some 35,000 Muslims in town. [22]

Government and politics

Community of the Agglomeration of Greater Toulouse
The Community of Agglomeration of Greater Toulouse ( Communauté d'agglomération du Grand Toulouse ) was created in 2001 to better coordinate transport, infrastructure and economic policies between the city of Toulouse and its immediate independent suburbs. It succeeds a previous district which had been created in 1992 with less powers than the current council. It combines the city of Toulouse and 24 independent communes , covering an area of 380 km 2 (147 sq mi), totalling a population of 583,229 inhabitants (as of 1999 census), 67% of whom live in the city of Toulouse proper. As of February 2004 estimate, the total population of the Community of Agglomeration of Greater Toulouse was 651,209 inhabitants, 65.5% of whom live in the city of Toulouse. Due to local political feuds, the Community of Agglomeration only hosts 61% of the population of the metropolitan area, the other independent suburbs having refused to join in. Since 2009, the Community of agglomeration has become an urban community (in French: communauté urbaine).

Local politics
One of the major political figures in Toulouse was Dominique Baudis , the mayor of Toulouse between 1983 and 2001, member of the centrist UDF . [ citation needed ] First known as a journalist famous for his coverage of the war in Lebanon , 36-year-old Dominique Baudis succeeded his father Pierre Baudis in 1983 as mayor of Toulouse. (Pierre Baudis was mayor from 1971 to 1983.) The Baudis dynasty succeeded in turning Toulouse into a center-right stronghold, whereas historically the city had been left-leaning since the 19th century. [ citation needed ]
During his time as mayor , Toulouse's economy and population boomed. [ citation needed ] He tried to strengthen the international role of Toulouse (such as its Airbus operations), as well as revive the cultural heritage of the city. The Occitan cross, flag of Languedoc and symbol of the counts of Toulouse, was chosen as the new flag of the city, instead of the traditional coat of arms of Toulouse (which included the fleur de lis of the French monarchy). Many cultural institutions were created, in order to attract foreign expatriates and emphasise the city's past. For example, monuments dating from the time of the counts of Toulouse were restored, the city's symphonic concert hall ( Halle aux Grains ) was refurbished, a city theater was built, a Museum of Modern Art was founded, the Bemberg Foundation (European paintings and bronzes from the Renaissance to the 20th century) was established, a huge pop music concert venue ( Zénith , the largest in France outside Paris) was built, the space museum and educational park Cité de l'Espace was founded, etc.
To deal with growth, major housing and transportation projects were launched. Perhaps the one for which Baudis [ weasel words ] is most famous is the Toulouse Metro : line A of the underground was opened in 1993, and Baudis succeeded in having work started on line B (which opened in 2007), despite strong local opposition to the anticipated costs. The creation of a system of underground car parking structures in Toulouse city centre was sharply criticised by the Green Party . [23]
In 2000, Dominique Baudis was at the zenith of his popularity, with approval rates of 85%. [ citation needed ] He announced that he would not run for a fourth (6-year) term in 2001. He explained that with 3 terms he was already the longest-serving mayor of Toulouse since the French Revolution ; he felt that change would be good for the city, and that the number of terms should be limited. He endorsed Philippe Douste-Blazy , then UDF mayor of Lourdes as his successor. Baudis has since been appointed president of the CSA ( Conseil supérieur de l'audiovisuel ) in Paris, the French equivalent of the American FCC .
Philippe Douste-Blazy narrowly won in the 2001 elections, which saw the left making its best showing in decades. Douste-Blazy had to deal with a reinvigorated political opposition, as well as with the dramatic explosion of the AZF plant in late 2001.
In March 2004, he entered the national government, and left Toulouse in the hands of his second-in-command Jean-Luc Moudenc , elected mayor by the municipal council. In March 2008, Moudenc was defeated by the Socialist Party's candidate Pierre Cohen .
At the next elections in 2014 Moudenc defeated Cohen in a rematch to re-take the job with more than 52% of the votes.

Sights
The Capitole de Toulouse (mainly 18th century), houses the Hôtel de Ville, the Théâtre du Capitole (opera house), and the Donjon du Capitole (16th century). It is located on the Place du Capitole . Cité de l'espace (City of Space) is a theme park of space exploration. The Médiathèque José Cabanis is a library. The Jardin des Plantes is a large park spanning several blocks, including a museum, cafés, activities for children and a botanical garden . Toulouse has many hôtel particulier (large single family homes usually circling an inner courtyard), the most significant in Toulouse is the Hôtel d'Assézat , which now houses five centuries of European art from the Renaissance to the 19th century.
The Bazacle is a ford across the Garonne, built in the late 12th century and also used for hydroelectricty. The river is crossed by the Pont Neuf from the 16th century.

Religious buildings
Toulouse Cathedral is the seat of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Toulouse . Saint-Sernin Basilica , part of the Way of Saint James UNESCO World Heritage Site , is the largest Romanesque church in Europe. It contains what is widely considered to be the most beautiful pipe organ in France. The Daurade basilica , of the 18th–19th century, was founded as a temple to the Roman god Apollo before conversion to Christianity in 410 AD. The Church of the Jacobins , (French: Ensemble conventuel des Jacobins ) in Toulouse is the burial place of Saint Thomas Aquinas .

Economy
The main industries are aeronautics , space, electronics, information technology and biotechnology . Toulouse hosts the Airbus headquarters and assembly-lines of Airbus A320 , A330 , A350 and A380 . (A320 lines also exist in Hamburg , Germany, Tianjin , China, and Mobile, Alabama , USA.) Airbus has its head office in Blagnac , near Toulouse. [24] [25] Airbus's France division has its main office in Toulouse. [25] Toulouse also hosts the headquarters of ATR , Sigfox and Groupe Latécoère . The Concorde supersonic aircraft was also constructed in Toulouse.

Education
Toulouse has the fourth-largest student population in France after Paris, Lyon and Lille with 103,000 students (2012). [26]

Colleges and universities
The University of Toulouse ( Université de Toulouse ), established in 1229, is located here (now split into three separate universities). Like the universities in Oxford and Paris, the University of Toulouse was established at a time when Europeans were starting to translate the writings of Arabs of Andalus and Greek philosophers. These writings challenged European ideology—inspiring scientific discoveries and advances in the arts—as society began seeing itself in a new way. These colleges were supported by the Church, in hopes of reconciling Greek philosophy and Christian theology.
Toulouse is also the home of Toulouse Business School (TBS), Toulouse School of Economics (TSE), the Institut supérieur européen de gestion group (ISEG Group), the Institut supérieur européen de formation par l'action (ISEFAC), E-Artsup and several engineering schools:
According to the French newspaper "L'Etudiant", Toulouse is the best city in France to study, and according to the British company QS ( Quacquarelli Symonds ), Toulouse is the 46th best student city in the world.

Primary and secondary schools
The most well known high schools in Toulouse are Lycée Pierre-de-Fermat ( fr ) , Lycée Saint-Joseph and Lycée Saint-Sernin . In 2012 a Jewish school was struck by an attack in which a rabbi, his two sons and the daughter of the school's director were murdered by Mohammed Merah .
International schools serving area expatriates are in nearby Colomiers :

Transport

Metro
In addition to an extensive bus system, the Toulouse Metro is a VAL (Véhicule Automatique Léger) metro system made up of driverless (automatic) rubber-tired trains. Line A runs for 12.5 km (7.8 mi) from Balma-Gramont in the north-east to Basso Cambo in the south-west. Line B, which opened in June 2007, serves 20 stations north to south and intersects line A at Jean Jaurès.

Train
The main railway station, with regional and national services, is Toulouse-Matabiau .
Line C has existed since line A was completed. It is not VAL but an urban railway line operated by SNCF . It connects to line A at Arènes . Two other stations located in Toulouse are also served by line C. Lardenne, formerly named "Gare des Capelles", changed its name in September 2003 when line C opened. [27] Le TOEC station opened on 1 September 2003 with the creation of line C, allowing an urban train service in Toulouse and close western suburbs. [27]
Similarly, Line D runs south from Toulouse Matabiau to Muret .

Tramway
The tramway line T1 (operating since December 2010), runs from Beauzelle to Toulouse passing through Blagnac. All urban bus, metro and tram services are operated by Tisséo. Tramway line T2 is a branch of the first line serving notably Toulouse Blagnac airport.

Bicycle
In 2007, a citywide bicycle rental scheme called VélôToulouse was introduced, [28] with bicycles available from automated stations for a daily, weekly, monthly or yearly subscription.

Airports
Airports include:
The Canal du Midi begins in Toulouse and runs up to Sète .

Communications
Toulouse is the home of Bonhoure Radio Tower, a 61-metre high lattice tower used for FM and TV transmission. [29] In 2001 a large (100 km) optical fiber (symmetric 360Gbit/s) network named Infrastructure Métropolitaine de Télécommunications was deployed around the city and suburbs. [30]

Culture
The Théâtre du Capitole is the home of opera and ballet; there has been a theatre on the site since 1736. [31] The Orchestre National du Capitole , long associated with Michel Plasson , plays at the Halle aux Grains. [32]
Le Château d'Eau , [33] an old 19th-century water-tower, was converted as a gallery in 1974 by Jean Dieuzaide, a French photographer from Toulouse and is now one of the oldest public places dedicated to photography in the world. Toulouse's art museums include the Musée des Augustins , the Musée des Abattoirs , the Musée Georges Labit , and the Fondation Bemberg in the Hôtel d'Assézat . The Musée Saint-Raymond is devoted to Antiquity and the Muséum de Toulouse to natural history.
Toulouse is the seat of the Académie des Jeux Floraux , the equivalent of the French Academy for the Occitan-speaking regions of southern France, making Toulouse the unofficial capital of Occitan culture . The traditional Cross of Toulouse , emblem of the County of Toulouse and commonly widespread around all of Occitania during the Middle Ages is the symbol of the city and of the newly founded Midi-Pyrénées région , as well as a popular Occitan symbol.
The city's gastronomic specialties include the Saucisse de Toulouse , a type of sausage , cassoulet Toulousain, a bean and pork stew , and garbure , a cabbage soup with poultry. Also, foie gras , the liver of an overfed duck or goose, is a delicacy mainly made in the Midi-Pyrénées. [ citation needed ]

Sport
Stade Toulousain of the Top 14 is considered [34] [35] one of the most successful rugby union clubs in all of Europe, having been crowned the Heineken Cup champions four times.
Toulouse Olympique represents the city in rugby league , playing in the English/European 2nd tier Championship from 2017.
The city also has a professional football team, Toulouse FC , who play in Ligue 1 , the highest level of football in France, and won the 1957 Coupe de France Final . The club play at the Stadium Municipal , which was a venue during the 1998 FIFA World Cup and 2007 Rugby World Cup , as well as hosting important club rugby games and several Rugby League World Cups . Toulouse was also a host of EuroBasket 1999 .

Notable people
Several notable Toulousains have been scientists, such as Jean Dausset , 1980 winner of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine ; 17th-century mathematician Pierre de Fermat , who spent his life in Toulouse, where he wrote Fermat's Last Theorem and was a lawyer in the city's Parlement ; Paul Sabatier , 1912 winner of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry ; Albert Fert , [36] 2007 winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics who grew up in Toulouse where he attended the Lycée Pierre-de-Fermat ( fr ) and Jean Tirole , owner of the 2014 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences , chairman and founder of the Toulouse School of Economics along with Jean-Jacques Laffont .
Musically, Toulouse is one of the two controversial, disputed birthplaces of Carlos Gardel (the other being Tacuarembo , Uruguay ), probably the most prominent figure in the history of the tango . The city's most renowned songwriter is Claude Nougaro .
Concerning arts, Toulouse is the birthplace of Impressionist painter Henri Martin as well as sculptors Alexandre Falguière and Antonin Mercié . Moreover, Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres and Antoine Bourdelle were trained at the Toulouse fine arts school. Post Impressionist painter Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec's (1864-1901) father was Count Alphonse Charles de Toulouse-Lautrec Monfa (1838-1913) and was part of an aristocratic family of Counts of Toulouse, Odet de Foix, Vimcomte de Lautrec and the Viscounts of Montfa. French graffiti artist Cyril Kongo was born in Toulouse in 1969.
Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse , one of the leaders of the First Crusade , was born in Toulouse. Aviation pioneer Clément Ader and psychiatrist Jean-Étienne Dominique Esquirol were also natives.

GNE (encyclopedia)
GNE (previously known as GNUPedia ) was a project to create a free content encyclopedia (licensed under the GNU Free Documentation License ) under the auspices of the Free Software Foundation . The idea for the project was initially proposed by Richard Stallman in December 2000 [1] and officially started in January 2001, moderated by Héctor Facundo Arena, an Argentinian programmer and GNU activist. [2]

History
Immediately upon its creation, GNUPedia was confronted by confusion with the similar-sounding Nupedia project led by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger , and controversy over whether this constituted a fork of the efforts to produce a free encyclopedia. In addition, Wales already owned the gnupedia.org domain name . [3] [4] The GNUPedia project changed its name to GNE (an abbreviation for "GNE's Not an Encyclopedia", a recursive acronym similar to that of the GNU Project ) and switched to a knowledgebase . [2] GNE was designed to avoid centralization and editors who enforced quality standards, which they viewed as possibly introducing bias. Jonathan Zittrain described GNE as a "collective blog" more than an encyclopedia. [5] Stallman has since lent his support to Wikipedia. [6]
In The Wikipedia Revolution , Andrew Lih explains the reasons behind the demise of GNE:
The GNU Project offers the following explanation about GNE:

Baike.com
Baike.com ( Chinese : 互动百科 ; pinyin : Hùdòng Bǎikē ), formerly Hudong and Hoodong , is a for-profit social network in China, including the world's largest Chinese encyclopedia /news website. [2] [3] It is China's largest wiki site, using paid advertising, [4] with over 7 million articles and more than 5 million volunteers, as of April 2013. [2] [3] [5] However, Baike.com is a news/ neologism encyclopedia, [2] and hence, it does not restrict articles to only long-term, sourced text with balanced point-of-view content. [ citation needed ] The contributors agree to release their writings with perpetual royalty-free license to publish their content, but it is not free for re-use on other websites. [6] As of January 2017, it had more than 16.00 million articles. [7]
Baike.com was exposed with touting and advertising on CCTV's International Consumer Day Gala in March 2017, much opposed to its slogan. [8]

History
Baike.com was founded in 2005 by CEO Pan Haidong , [9] who had moved back to China after earning a Ph.D. in systems engineering from Boston University in 2002. [10]
Baike.com, a 2007 RedHerring 100 Asia company, developed its own wiki software platform, called HDWiki , as a rival to MediaWiki . The system has some social networking -like interactive features, such as user profile, friends and groups. The first version was released in November 2006 and by November 2007 version 3 with added functions, features, and more stability was released. [11]
The HDWiki software is free for non-commercial use, has been downloaded 200,000 times and currently supports over 1,000 other web sites in China (as of December 2007), consisting mostly of tech researchers, open source software groups, government, universities, and high school students. [ citation needed ]
In 2011 it was announced that Draper Fisher Jurvetson had invested $15 million in Baike.com. [10]
On 22 February 2012 Baike.com submitted a complaint to the State Administration for Industry and Commerce asking for a review of the behavior of Baidu , accusing it of being monopolistic. [12]
In December 2012, the company changed its English name from Hudong to Baike.com. [13]

Features
Baike.com is a wiki and lets its users edit and contribute material. Frequent users may accumulate credits redeemable for gifts. [10] It has also included features of social networking sites , including chat forums and fan groups. [2] [14] Baike.com is a for- profit business partially supported by advertising and paid support services. [2] Contributors grant Baike.com a perpetual royalty-free license to publish and re-use the content; it does not release the content under a free license and does not allow re-use on other sites.

Citizendium
Citizendium ( / ˌ s ɪ t ᵻ ˈ z ɛ n d i əm / SIT -i- ZEN -dee-əm ; "the citizens' compendium of everything") [4] is an English-language wiki -based free encyclopedia project launched by Larry Sanger , who had previously co-founded Wikipedia in 2001. [5] [6]
It was first announced in September 2006 as a fork of the English Wikipedia , [7] but that idea was abandoned prior to its March 2007 public launch in favor of emphasizing original articles. The project aims to improve on the Wikipedia model by providing increased reliability. [8] It hopes to achieve this by requiring virtually all contributors to use their real names, by strictly moderating the project for unprofessional behavior, by providing what it calls "gentle expert oversight" of everyday contributors, and also through its "approved articles". Approved articles have undergone a form of peer-review by topic experts with credentials, and are closed to real-time editing. [9] [10]
By 27 October 2011, the site had fewer than 100 active members. [2] As of August 2013 [update] , it had 16,484 articles, of which 165 had achieved editorial approval, and around 10 contributors making at least 20 edits a month. [3] The managing editor was Anthony Sebastian, until the office was vacated in 2016. [11]

Founder viewpoints
Sanger said in a 17 October 2006 press release that Citizendium "will soon attempt to unseat Wikipedia as the go-to destination for general information online". [12] In August 2007, he captioned its pages: "The world needs a more credible free encyclopedia." [13] The project began its pilot phase in October and November 2006.
On 18 January 2007, a change of plans was announced. Sanger announced on the CZ mailing list that only articles marked "CZ Live", those which have been or will soon be worked on by Citizendium contributors, would remain on the site, and all other articles forked from Wikipedia would be deleted. Not all Citizendium contributors were supportive of this change, but Sanger emphasized that this deletion was "an experiment" and a new set of Wikipedia articles could be uploaded if the experiment were deemed unsuccessful. [14]

Planning for succession of editor-in-chief
In May 2009, Sanger reduced his direct activity at Citizendium, and, in a message on 30 July 2009, he reminded those on the Citizendium-l mailing list of his previously declared intention not to serve as editor-in-chief for more than two or three years after the start of the project. [15] Sanger has reiterated his call for the Citizendium community to prepare an orderly process for choosing a new editor-in-chief. Sanger said that he was spending more time on his WatchKnow project, [16] partly because he needs to earn an income—he said the "Citizendium project doesn't earn me a dime"—and partly because the Citizendium community had demonstrated that it could function effectively without his close, daily involvement, and because "there are squeakier wheels in my life just now". He added that stepping aside may "precipitate something of a constitutional crisis, considering that we [Citizendium] never adopted a proper charter". Citizendium finally ratified its charter in September 2010. [17] On 22 September 2010, Sanger stepped down as editor-in-chief [18] and subsequently gave up editorial powers and rights to the project. Sanger did not appoint a successor or interim editor-in-chief, and the project's financial position did not become clear until after his departure. [19]

Nature of the project

Fork of Wikipedia
According to statements and essays on Citizendium, [20] [21] [22] the project was initially intended to begin as a fork of Wikipedia, carrying a copy of each article—under the rules of the GNU Free Documentation License —as it existed on Wikipedia at the time of Citizendium's launch. [23] However, after initiating the idea of not forking, and then soliciting comments on the matter from Citizendium mailing list and web forum members, Sanger said that a complete fork at launch was not a "foregone conclusion". [24] On 18 January 2007, Sanger announced that the pilot would, as an experiment, only carry articles that had been, or would soon be, worked on by Citizendium contributors, instead of a complete set of Wikipedia articles. He stated that the experiment "represents a reconception of our project's basic aim". [14]
No announcement has yet been made on Citizendium editions in languages other than English, but Sanger has stated in his essays that they may be forthcoming after the English-language version is established and successfully working. In a review of Andrew Keen 's book The Cult of the Amateur , Sanger comments ironically on Keen's favorable treatment of Citizendium: "The first example of a 'solution' he offers is the Citizendium, or the Citizens' Compendium, which I like to describe briefly as Wikipedia with editors and real names. But how can Citizendium be a solution to the problems he raises, if it has experts working without pay, and the result is free? If it succeeds, won't it contribute to the decline of reference publishing?" [25]

Project goal
The stated aim of the project is to create a "new compendium of knowledge" based on the contributions of "intellectuals", defined as "educated, thinking people who read about science or ideas regularly". [26] Citizendium aimed to foster an expert culture and a community that encourages participants (to be called "authors") to "respect" the expert contributions (by what he referred to as a "gentle process of guidance").
Experts are required to verify their qualifications openly, for transparency and publicly accepted authority. [27] This contrasts with the open and largely anonymous nature of Wikipedia, [28] where subject specialists have neither any verifiable special knowledge of their subject nor agreed special status. Sanger stated that editors would not have pre-approval rights over edits by ordinary authors, though editors would have somewhat undefined authority over articles that fall within their specific area of expertise.

Policies and structure
Unlike Wikipedia, Citizendium does not allow anonymous editing. Participants must register under their real names with a working email address. Sanger decided that Citizendium administrators would be called "constables", and need a bachelor's degree to qualify. He also instituted a minimum "maturity" requirement—25 years of age—for constables. [27] The "head" constable is the Chief Constable (D. Matt Innis), and the head editor is the Managing Editor . [29]
Originally, Sanger operated as Editor-in-Chief , the "main individual in charge", part of and answerable to a Board of Directors . Sanger stated that final decisions about management structure will not be made "until more of the (future) primary stakeholders are on the scene". [30]
Citizendium articles are subject to an "approval" process after they have achieved reasonable quality. An "editor" can determine when an article is ready to be approved. [27]
The project is being carried out under the auspices of the Citizendium Foundation, [29] and was initially phased under the Tides Center as an incubator project. [31]

Content
Citizendium original articles are available under the Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License (CC BY-SA). [32] "Articles that originated in part from Wikipedia are also available under [the] GNU Free Documentation License [version] 1.2 ." [33] The decision was announced on 21 December 2007, about a year after the launch of the pilot project. [34]

History

Pilot project
The project was announced by Sanger on 15 September 2006, at the Wizards of OS 4 conference in Berlin . He gave no deadline for the full launch of the wiki . [35] [36] However, on 2 October 2006, Sanger released a pilot project announcement that envisioned a fully functioning wiki within "one to two months".
In an apparent attempt to quicken the pace of the project, on 2 October 2006, Citizendium web forum moderator Peter Hitchmough suggested what he called an " alpha test " of the concept. Hitchmough proposed the forking of a limited number of Wikipedia articles to a site where Citizendium web forum and mailing list members could "rewrite a complete section" of Wikipedia content. [37]
Larry Sanger reacted enthusiastically to the idea and at first suggested his already existing Textop wiki as the site for the alpha test. Sanger later posted that Textop would not be a good choice, but showed continued interest in the proposal. He envisioned a "restricted-access" wiki where the idea could be tried and requested further discussion. [38]
No access to the pilot version of Citizendium, even read-only, was allowed to the general public. Sanger stated: "Only invited people will be able to view and edit the pilot project wiki." [39] Sanger also said that constables for the pilot project will be chosen by the chief constable. [40]
In a press release on 17 October 2006, Sanger announced: "the fledgling Citizendium Foundation will launch a six-week pilot project open to potential contributors by invitation". Several editors and other project leaders were named. It was also announced that the Citizendium Foundation had "started the process of applying for 501(c) (3) status [non-profit status]" and had "received a firm commitment for a significant seed grant from a foundation, as well as small personal donations". [12] In a follow-up post to the press release, Sanger said that the initial group allowed access to the pilot would consist of "ten editors, three constables, six authors, and me." [41]
The pilot project began operations on 23 October 2006. [42] On 8 November, Larry Sanger reported that 263 user names had access to the pilot wiki, 183 articles on the wiki were "live" (meaning "someone is or intends to be working on them") and there were about 300 total edits to the wiki on 7 November. [43]
In a 17 January 2007 post to the Citizendium forum, Sanger stated that "we have had only 10–20 (very) active people out of 500 accounts created". As a result, Sanger decided to delete all articles besides those marked "CZ live" from the pilot project in an attempt to motivate greater participation. [44] On 22 January 2007, Citizendium experimented with a new self-registration procedure: read/write access was granted automatically after creation of the account. [45] There were a few instances of vandalism after this change, though the vandalism was quickly reverted. [46] On 19 January, Sanger announced the formal organization of Citizendium as a legal non-profit organization. [47]
On 16 February 2007, in response to rising site vandalism, automatic account creation [45] was put on hold while increased protections were being put in place to counter vandalism. [48] The next day, page moves were limited to constables as an additional measure against vandalism. [49] In addition, Sanger continued the process of un-forking the Citizendium from Wikipedia by inviting contributors to delete any Wikipedia content that had changed only superficially since it was imported.

Inauguration
On 25 March 2007, Citizendium ended its pilot phase and went live, into its beta phase, and the site became publicly readable. [50] The launch coincided with a feature-length Associated Press article that ran widely, with a title in USA Today of "Citizendium aims to be better Wikipedia". [51]
The day prior to launch, Sanger released an essay, "Why the Citizendium Will (Probably) Succeed" in which he stated that activity at Citizendium grew from 100 edits a day in the first month to over 500 prior to launch. [52] After the launch, on 27 March 2007, a press release quotes Sanger as saying "You don't have to choose between content and accountability. We have shown that we can create open and credible content. We can, in fact, be open to all sorts of participants, but still hold people to higher standards of content and behavior as a community." [53]
Sometime after the launch, it was noted that Citizendium's family-friendly policy would mean the project would likely tend to avoid articles on slang terms for sexual activity, and particularly explicit articles on sexual practices. [54] The Citizendium has a "professionalism" policy for editors, which Sanger said is different from most online communities. [55]
On 29 June 2007, Sanger announced an initiative via the project-wide mailing list that he dubbed "Citizendium 2.0". Characterizing his comments as a "project planning document", Sanger detailed a series of initiatives designed to launch Citizendium into its next phase of development. The document outlined plans for a judicial board, an advisory board, a personnel manager, a new chairman of the editorial council, wider participation in the project by volunteers, a system of subpages for articles, and an expanded article checklist. [56]

Later developments
At the project's first anniversary in September 2007, Citizendium included 3000 articles written and revised by 2000 people. [57] A number of media reports appeared in late October and early November 2007 about the anniversary of Citizendium. A story in the Financial Times quoted Larry Sanger predicting strong growth for the project: "At some point, possibly very soon, the Citizendium will grow explosively – say, quadruple the number of its active contributors, or even grow by an order of magnitude. And it will experience that growth over the course of a month or two, and its growth will continue to accelerate from that higher rate." [58] (See chart at right; active contributors slowly went upwards during the remainder of 2007, then bubbled higher in the first quarter of 2008, but after that point steadily declined.)
Citizendium was honored on 5 December 2007, as an award finalist of the Society for New Communications Research. The Society describes itself as a nonprofit global think-tank "dedicated to the advanced study of new communications tools, technologies and emerging modes of communication, and their effect on traditional media, professional communications, business, culture and society". The Society chose Citizendium for an award because it considered it "a leading organization" in these respects. [59]
Library writer Walt Crawford noted in April 2009 that Citizendium appeared to be in an "extended lull", with a constant rate of creation of new articles at around 13–14 per day and a decline in the number of active authors. [60] In August 2009, Richard Waters wrote in the Financial Times technology blog: "At best, Citizendium could be called a qualified success. Launched in March 2007, as of August 2009 it had 11,810 articles – 2,999,674 fewer than the English-language version of Wikipedia." [61] Mathieu O'Neil, Principal Researcher at the Australian Department of Broadband, Communication and the Digital Economy, wrote in a March 2010 article on crowdsourcing that "new participants to Wikipedia know that their contributions will have a significant audience; becoming a Wikipedia editor is trivial and instantaneous; since it lacks this immediate quality, Citizendium failed to attract the crowd". [62]
The project had a core of 25 contributors who made more than 100 edits a month, with 90 participants making at least one edit, during March 2010. Median word count dropped from 468 words per article in October 2007 to 151 in May 2010. [63] In June 2010, the number of users making 1, 20 or 100 edits per month all were at their lowest point since the project went public in March 2007. [63] By October 2011, only about a dozen members made edits on a typical day. [2] In September 2015, only seven editors had been active in the previous 30 days. [64]
In November 2016, a referendum was held to abolish the governing Citizendium Charter and the Council in favour of Wikipedia-style discussion and consensus. It attracted nine votes, and was passed. A new Managing Editor was to be elected at the same time, but there were no nominations. [65]

Internet
The Internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks that use the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link devices worldwide. It is a network of networks that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail , telephony , and peer-to-peer networks for file sharing .
The origins of the Internet date back to research commissioned by the United States federal government in the 1960s to build robust, fault-tolerant communication via computer networks. [1] The primary precursor network, the ARPANET , initially served as a backbone for interconnection of regional academic and military networks in the 1980s. The funding of the National Science Foundation Network as a new backbone in the 1980s, as well as private funding for other commercial extensions, led to worldwide participation in the development of new networking technologies, and the merger of many networks. [2] The linking of commercial networks and enterprises by the early 1990s marks the beginning of the transition to the modern Internet, [3] and generated a sustained exponential growth as generations of institutional, personal , and mobile computers were connected to the network. Although the Internet was widely used by academia since the 1980s, the commercialization incorporated its services and technologies into virtually every aspect of modern life.
Internet use grew rapidly in the West from the mid-1990s and from the late 1990s in the developing world . [4] In the two decades since then, Internet use has grown 100-times, measured for the period of one year, to over one third of the world population . [5] [6] Most traditional communications media, including telephony, radio, television, paper mail and newspapers are being reshaped or redefined by the Internet, giving birth to new services such as email , Internet telephony , Internet television , online music , digital newspapers, and video streaming websites. Newspaper, book, and other print publishing are adapting to website technology, or are reshaped into blogging , web feeds and online news aggregators . The Internet has enabled and accelerated new forms of personal interactions through instant messaging , Internet forums , and social networking . Online shopping has grown exponentially both for major retailers and small businesses and entrepreneurs , as it enables firms to extend their " brick and mortar " presence to serve a larger market or even sell goods and services entirely online . Business-to-business and financial services on the Internet affect supply chains across entire industries.
The Internet has no centralized governance in either technological implementation or policies for access and usage; each constituent network sets its own policies. [7] Only the overreaching definitions of the two principal name spaces in the Internet, the Internet Protocol address space and the Domain Name System (DNS), are directed by a maintainer organization, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). The technical underpinning and standardization of the core protocols is an activity of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), a non-profit organization of loosely affiliated international participants that anyone may associate with by contributing technical expertise. [8]

Terminology
The term Internet , when used to refer to the specific global system of interconnected Internet Protocol (IP) networks, is a proper noun [9] and may be written with an initial capital letter . In common use and the media, it is often not capitalized, viz. the internet. Some guides specify that the word should be capitalized when used as a noun, but not capitalized when used as an adjective. [10] The Internet is also often referred to as the Net , as a short form of network . Historically, as early as 1849, the word internetted was used uncapitalized as an adjective, meaning interconnected or interwoven . [11] The designers of early computer networks used internet both as a noun and as a verb in shorthand form of internetwork or internetworking, meaning interconnecting computer networks. [12]
The terms Internet and World Wide Web are often used interchangeably in everyday speech; it is common to speak of " going on the Internet " when invoking a web browser to view web pages . However, the World Wide Web or the Web is only one of a large number of Internet services. The Web is a collection of interconnected documents (web pages) and other web resources , linked by hyperlinks and URLs . [13] As another point of comparison, Hypertext Transfer Protocol , or HTTP, is the language used on the Web for information transfer, yet it is just one of many languages or protocols that can be used for communication on the Internet. [14] The term Interweb is a portmanteau of Internet and World Wide Web typically used sarcastically to parody a technically unsavvy user.

History
Research into packet switching started in the early 1960s, [15] and packet switched networks such as the ARPANET , CYCLADES , [16] [17] the Merit Network , [18] NPL network , [19] Tymnet , and Telenet , were developed in the late 1960s and 1970s using a variety of protocols . [20] The ARPANET project led to the development of protocols for internetworking , by which multiple separate networks could be joined into a single network of networks. [21] ARPANET development began with two network nodes which were interconnected between the Network Measurement Center at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science directed by Leonard Kleinrock , and the NLS system at SRI International (SRI) by Douglas Engelbart in Menlo Park , California, on 29 October 1969. [22] The third site was the Culler-Fried Interactive Mathematics Center at the University of California, Santa Barbara , followed by the University of Utah Graphics Department. In an early sign of future growth, fifteen sites were connected to the young ARPANET by the end of 1971. [23] [24] These early years were documented in the 1972 film Computer Networks: The Heralds of Resource Sharing .
Early international collaborations on the ARPANET were rare. European developers were concerned with developing the X.25 networks. [25] Notable exceptions were the Norwegian Seismic Array ( NORSAR ) in June 1973, followed in 1973 by Sweden with satellite links to the Tanum Earth Station and Peter T. Kirstein 's research group in the United Kingdom, initially at the Institute of Computer Science , University of London and later at University College London . [26] [27] [28] In December 1974, RFC 675 ( Specification of Internet Transmission Control Program ), by Vinton Cerf, Yogen Dalal, and Carl Sunshine, used the term internet as a shorthand for internetworking and later RFCs repeated this use. [29] Access to the ARPANET was expanded in 1981 when the National Science Foundation (NSF) funded the Computer Science Network (CSNET). In 1982, the Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP) was standardized, which permitted worldwide proliferation of interconnected networks.
TCP/IP network access expanded again in 1986 when the National Science Foundation Network (NSFNet) provided access to supercomputer sites in the United States for researchers, first at speeds of 56 kbit/s and later at 1.5 Mbit/s and 45 Mbit/s. [30] Commercial Internet service providers (ISPs) emerged in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The ARPANET was decommissioned in 1990. By 1995, the Internet was fully commercialized in the U.S. when the NSFNet was decommissioned, removing the last restrictions on use of the Internet to carry commercial traffic. [31] The Internet rapidly expanded in Europe and Australia in the mid to late 1980s [32] [33] and to Asia in the late 1980s and early 1990s. [34] The beginning of dedicated transatlantic communication between the NSFNET and networks in Europe was established with a low-speed satellite relay between Princeton University and Stockholm, Sweden in December 1988. [35] Although other network protocols such as UUCP had global reach well before this time, this marked the beginning of the Internet as an intercontinental network.
Public commercial use of the Internet began in mid-1989 with the connection of MCI Mail and Compuserve 's email capabilities to the 500,000 users of the Internet. [36] Just months later on January 1, 1990, PSInet launched an alternate Internet backbone for commercial use; one of the networks that would grow into the commercial Internet we know today. In March 1990, the first high-speed T1 (1.5 Mbit/s) link between the NSFNET and Europe was installed between Cornell University and CERN , allowing much more robust communications than were capable with satellites. [37] Six months later Tim Berners-Lee would begin writing WorldWideWeb , the first web browser after two years of lobbying CERN management. By Christmas 1990, Berners-Lee had built all the tools necessary for a working Web: the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) 0.9, [38] the HyperText Markup Language (HTML), the first Web browser (which was also a HTML editor and could access Usenet newsgroups and FTP files), the first HTTP server software (later known as CERN httpd ), the first web server , [39] and the first Web pages that described the project itself. In 1991 the Commercial Internet eXchange was founded, allowing PSInet to communicate with the other commercial networks CERFnet and Alternet. Since 1995 the Internet has tremendously impacted culture and commerce, including the rise of near instant communication by email, instant messaging , telephony ( Voice over Internet Protocol or VoIP), two-way interactive video calls , and the World Wide Web [40] with its discussion forums , blogs, social networking , and online shopping sites. Increasing amounts of data are transmitted at higher and higher speeds over fiber optic networks operating at 1-Gbit/s, 10-Gbit/s, or more.
The Internet continues to grow, driven by ever greater amounts of online information and knowledge, commerce, entertainment and social networking . [43] During the late 1990s, it was estimated that traffic on the public Internet grew by 100 percent per year, while the mean annual growth in the number of Internet users was thought to be between 20% and 50%. [44] This growth is often attributed to the lack of central administration, which allows organic growth of the network, as well as the non-proprietary nature of the Internet protocols, which encourages vendor interoperability and prevents any one company from exerting too much control over the network. [45] As of 31 March 2011, the estimated total number of Internet users was 2.095 billion (30.2% of world population). [46] It is estimated that in 1993 the Internet carried only 1% of the information flowing through two-way telecommunication, by 2000 this figure had grown to 51%, and by 2007 more than 97% of all telecommunicated information was carried over the Internet. [47]

Governance
The Internet is a global network comprising many voluntarily interconnected autonomous networks. It operates without a central governing body. The technical underpinning and standardization of the core protocols ( IPv4 and IPv6 ) is an activity of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), a non-profit organization of loosely affiliated international participants that anyone may associate with by contributing technical expertise. To maintain interoperability, the principal name spaces of the Internet are administered by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). ICANN is governed by an international board of directors drawn from across the Internet technical, business, academic, and other non-commercial communities. ICANN coordinates the assignment of unique identifiers for use on the Internet, including domain names , Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, application port numbers in the transport protocols, and many other parameters. Globally unified name spaces are essential for maintaining the global reach of the Internet. This role of ICANN distinguishes it as perhaps the only central coordinating body for the global Internet. [48]
Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) allocate IP addresses:
The National Telecommunications and Information Administration , an agency of the United States Department of Commerce , continues to have final approval over changes to the DNS root zone . [49] [50] [51] The Internet Society (ISOC) was founded in 1992 with a mission to "assure the open development, evolution and use of the Internet for the benefit of all people throughout the world" . [52] Its members include individuals (anyone may join) as well as corporations, organizations , governments, and universities. Among other activities ISOC provides an administrative home for a number of less formally organized groups that are involved in developing and managing the Internet, including: the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), Internet Architecture Board (IAB), Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG), Internet Research Task Force (IRTF), and Internet Research Steering Group (IRSG). On 16 November 2005, the United Nations-sponsored World Summit on the Information Society in Tunis established the Internet Governance Forum (IGF) to discuss Internet-related issues.

Infrastructure
The communications infrastructure of the Internet consists of its hardware components and a system of software layers that control various aspects of the architecture.

Routing and service tiers
Internet service providers establish the worldwide connectivity between individual networks at various levels of scope. End-users who only access the Internet when needed to perform a function or obtain information, represent the bottom of the routing hierarchy. At the top of the routing hierarchy are the tier 1 networks , large telecommunication companies that exchange traffic directly with each other via peering agreements. Tier 2 and lower level networks buy Internet transit from other providers to reach at least some parties on the global Internet, though they may also engage in peering. An ISP may use a single upstream provider for connectivity, or implement multihoming to achieve redundancy and load balancing. Internet exchange points are major traffic exchanges with physical connections to multiple ISPs. Large organizations, such as academic institutions, large enterprises, and governments, may perform the same function as ISPs, engaging in peering and purchasing transit on behalf of their internal networks. Research networks tend to interconnect with large subnetworks such as GEANT , GLORIAD , Internet2 , and the UK's national research and education network , JANET . Both the Internet IP routing structure and hypertext links of the World Wide Web are examples of scale-free networks . [53] Computers and routers use routing tables in their operating system to direct IP packets to the next-hop router or destination. Routing tables are maintained by manual configuration or automatically by routing protocols . End-nodes typically use a default route that points toward an ISP providing transit, while ISP routers use the Border Gateway Protocol to establish the most efficient routing across the complex connections of the global Internet.

Access
Common methods of Internet access by users include dial-up with a computer modem via telephone circuits, broadband over coaxial cable , fiber optics or copper wires, Wi-Fi , satellite and cellular telephone technology ( 3G , 4G ). The Internet may often be accessed from computers in libraries and Internet cafes . Internet access points exist in many public places such as airport halls and coffee shops. Various terms are used, such as public Internet kiosk , public access terminal , and Web payphone . Many hotels also have public terminals, though these are usually fee-based. These terminals are widely accessed for various usages, such as ticket booking, bank deposit, or online payment. Wi-Fi provides wireless access to the Internet via local computer networks. Hotspots providing such access include Wi-Fi cafes , where users need to bring their own wireless devices such as a laptop or PDA . These services may be free to all, free to customers only, or fee-based.
Grassroots efforts have led to wireless community networks . Commercial Wi-Fi services covering large city areas are in place in New York , London , Vienna , Toronto , San Francisco , Philadelphia , Chicago and Pittsburgh . The Internet can then be accessed from such places as a park bench. [54] Apart from Wi-Fi, there have been experiments with proprietary mobile wireless networks like Ricochet , various high-speed data services over cellular phone networks, and fixed wireless services. High-end mobile phones such as smartphones in general come with Internet access through the phone network. Web browsers such as Opera are available on these advanced handsets, which can also run a wide variety of other Internet software. More mobile phones have Internet access than PCs, though this is not as widely used. [55] An Internet access provider and protocol matrix differentiates the methods used to get online.

Structure
Many computer scientists describe the Internet as a "prime example of a large-scale, highly engineered, yet highly complex system ". [56] The structure was found to be highly robust to random failures, [57] yet, very vulnerable to intentional attacks. [58] The Internet structure and its usage characteristics have been studied extensively and the possibility of developing alternative structures has been investigated. [59]

Protocols
While the hardware components in the Internet infrastructure can often be used to support other software systems, it is the design and the standardization process of the software that characterizes the Internet and provides the foundation for its scalability and success. The responsibility for the architectural design of the Internet software systems has been assumed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). [60] The IETF conducts standard-setting work groups, open to any individual, about the various aspects of Internet architecture. Resulting contributions and standards are published as Request for Comments (RFC) documents on the IETF web site. The principal methods of networking that enable the Internet are contained in specially designated RFCs that constitute the Internet Standards . Other less rigorous documents are simply informative, experimental, or historical, or document the best current practices (BCP) when implementing Internet technologies.
The Internet standards describe a framework known as the Internet protocol suite . This is a model architecture that divides methods into a layered system of protocols, originally documented in RFC 1122 and RFC 1123 . The layers correspond to the environment or scope in which their services operate. At the top is the application layer , space for the application-specific networking methods used in software applications. For example, a web browser program uses the client-server application model and a specific protocol of interaction between servers and clients, while many file-sharing systems use a peer-to-peer paradigm. Below this top layer, the transport layer connects applications on different hosts with a logical channel through the network with appropriate data exchange methods.
Underlying these layers are the networking technologies that interconnect networks at their borders and exchange traffic across them. The Internet layer enables computers to identify and locate each other via Internet Protocol (IP) addresses , and routes their traffic via intermediate (transit) networks. Last, at the bottom of the architecture is the link layer , which provides logical connectivity between hosts on the same network link, such as a local area network (LAN) or a dial-up connection . The model, also known as TCP/IP , is designed to be independent of the underlying hardware used for the physical connections, which the model does not concern itself with in any detail. Other models have been developed, such as the OSI model , that attempt to be comprehensive in every aspect of communications. While many similarities exist between the models, they are not compatible in the details of description or implementation. Yet, TCP/IP protocols are usually included in the discussion of OSI networking.
The most prominent component of the Internet model is the Internet Protocol (IP), which provides addressing systems, including IP addresses , for computers on the network. IP enables internetworking and, in essence, establishes the Internet itself. Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4) is the initial version used on the first generation of the Internet and is still in dominant use. It was designed to address up to ~4.3 billion (10 9 ) hosts. However, the explosive growth of the Internet has led to IPv4 address exhaustion , which entered its final stage in 2011, [61] when the global address allocation pool was exhausted. A new protocol version, IPv6, was developed in the mid-1990s, which provides vastly larger addressing capabilities and more efficient routing of Internet traffic. IPv6 is currently in growing deployment around the world, since Internet address registries ( RIRs ) began to urge all resource managers to plan rapid adoption and conversion. [62]
IPv6 is not directly interoperable by design with IPv4. In essence, it establishes a parallel version of the Internet not directly accessible with IPv4 software. Thus, translation facilities must exist for internetworking or nodes must have duplicate networking software for both networks. Essentially all modern computer operating systems support both versions of the Internet Protocol. Network infrastructure, however, has been lagging in this development. Aside from the complex array of physical connections that make up its infrastructure, the Internet is facilitated by bi- or multi-lateral commercial contracts, e.g., peering agreements , and by technical specifications or protocols that describe the exchange of data over the network. Indeed, the Internet is defined by its interconnections and routing policies.

Services
The Internet carries many network services , most prominently mobile apps such as social media apps, the World Wide Web , electronic mail , multiplayer online games , Internet telephony , and file sharing services.

World Wide Web
Many people use the terms Internet and World Wide Web , or just the Web , interchangeably, but the two terms are not synonymous. The World Wide Web is the primary application that billions of people use on the Internet, and it has changed their lives immeasurably. [63] [64] However, the Internet provides many other services. The Web is a global set of documents , images and other resources, logically interrelated by hyperlinks and referenced with Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs). URIs symbolically identify services, servers , and other databases, and the documents and resources that they can provide. Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the main access protocol of the World Wide Web. Web services also use HTTP to allow software systems to communicate in order to share and exchange business logic and data.
World Wide Web browser software, such as Microsoft 's Internet Explorer , Mozilla Firefox , Opera , Apple 's Safari , and Google Chrome , lets users navigate from one web page to another via hyperlinks embedded in the documents. These documents may also contain any combination of computer data , including graphics, sounds, text , video , multimedia and interactive content that runs while the user is interacting with the page. Client-side software can include animations, games , office applications and scientific demonstrations. Through keyword -driven Internet research using search engines like Yahoo! and Google , users worldwide have easy, instant access to a vast and diverse amount of online information. Compared to printed media, books, encyclopedias and traditional libraries, the World Wide Web has enabled the decentralization of information on a large scale.
The Web has also enabled individuals and organizations to publish ideas and information to a potentially large audience online at greatly reduced expense and time delay. Publishing a web page, a blog, or building a website involves little initial cost and many cost-free services are available. However, publishing and maintaining large, professional web sites with attractive, diverse and up-to-date information is still a difficult and expensive proposition. Many individuals and some companies and groups use web logs or blogs, which are largely used as easily updatable online diaries. Some commercial organizations encourage staff to communicate advice in their areas of specialization in the hope that visitors will be impressed by the expert knowledge and free information, and be attracted to the corporation as a result.
One example of this practice is Microsoft , whose product developers publish their personal blogs in order to pique the public's interest in their work. [ original research? ] Collections of personal web pages published by large service providers remain popular and have become increasingly sophisticated. Whereas operations such as Angelfire and GeoCities have existed since the early days of the Web, newer offerings from, for example, Facebook and Twitter currently have large followings. These operations often brand themselves as social network services rather than simply as web page hosts. [ citation needed ]
Advertising on popular web pages can be lucrative, and e-commerce which is the sale of products and services directly via the Web, continues to grow. Online advertising is a form of marketing and advertising which uses the Internet to deliver promotional marketing messages to consumers. It includes email marketing, search engine marketing (SEM), social media marketing, many types of display advertising (including web banner advertising), and mobile advertising . In 2011, Internet advertising revenues in the United States surpassed those of cable television and nearly exceeded those of broadcast television . [65] :19 Many common online advertising practices are controversial and increasingly subject to regulation.
When the Web developed in the 1990s, a typical web page was stored in completed form on a web server, formatted in HTML , complete for transmission to a web browser in response to a request. Over time, the process of creating and serving web pages has become dynamic, creating a flexible design, layout, and content. Websites are often created using content management software with, initially, very little content. Contributors to these systems, who may be paid staff, members of an organization or the public, fill underlying databases with content using editing pages designed for that purpose while casual visitors view and read this content in HTML form. There may or may not be editorial, approval and security systems built into the process of taking newly entered content and making it available to the target visitors.

Communication
Email is an important communications service available on the Internet. The concept of sending electronic text messages between parties in a way analogous to mailing letters or memos predates the creation of the Internet. Pictures, documents, and other files are sent as email attachments . Emails can be cc-ed to multiple email addresses .
Internet telephony is another common communications service made possible by the creation of the Internet. VoIP stands for Voice-over- Internet Protocol , referring to the protocol that underlies all Internet communication. The idea began in the early 1990s with walkie-talkie -like voice applications for personal computers. In recent years many VoIP systems have become as easy to use and as convenient as a normal telephone. The benefit is that, as the Internet carries the voice traffic, VoIP can be free or cost much less than a traditional telephone call, especially over long distances and especially for those with always-on Internet connections such as cable or ADSL . VoIP is maturing into a competitive alternative to traditional telephone service. Interoperability between different providers has improved and the ability to call or receive a call from a traditional telephone is available. Simple, inexpensive VoIP network adapters are available that eliminate the need for a personal computer.
Voice quality can still vary from call to call, but is often equal to and can even exceed that of traditional calls. Remaining problems for VoIP include emergency telephone number dialing and reliability. Currently, a few VoIP providers provide an emergency service, but it is not universally available. Older traditional phones with no "extra features" may be line-powered only and operate during a power failure; VoIP can never do so without a backup power source for the phone equipment and the Internet access devices. VoIP has also become increasingly popular for gaming applications, as a form of communication between players. Popular VoIP clients for gaming include Ventrilo and Teamspeak . Modern video game consoles also offer VoIP chat features.

Data transfer
File sharing is an example of transferring large amounts of data across the Internet. A computer file can be emailed to customers, colleagues and friends as an attachment. It can be uploaded to a website or File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server for easy download by others. It can be put into a "shared location" or onto a file server for instant use by colleagues. The load of bulk downloads to many users can be eased by the use of " mirror " servers or peer-to-peer networks. In any of these cases, access to the file may be controlled by user authentication , the transit of the file over the Internet may be obscured by encryption , and money may change hands for access to the file. The price can be paid by the remote charging of funds from, for example, a credit card whose details are also passed – usually fully encrypted – across the Internet. The origin and authenticity of the file received may be checked by digital signatures or by MD5 or other message digests. These simple features of the Internet, over a worldwide basis, are changing the production, sale, and distribution of anything that can be reduced to a computer file for transmission. This includes all manner of print publications, software products, news, music, film, video, photography, graphics and the other arts. This in turn has caused seismic shifts in each of the existing industries that previously controlled the production and distribution of these products.
Streaming media is the real-time delivery of digital media for the immediate consumption or enjoyment by end users. Many radio and television broadcasters provide Internet feeds of their live audio and video productions. They may also allow time-shift viewing or listening such as Preview, Classic Clips and Listen Again features. These providers have been joined by a range of pure Internet "broadcasters" who never had on-air licenses. This means that an Internet-connected device, such as a computer or something more specific, can be used to access on-line media in much the same way as was previously possible only with a television or radio receiver. The range of available types of content is much wider, from specialized technical webcasts to on-demand popular multimedia services. Podcasting is a variation on this theme, where – usually audio – material is downloaded and played back on a computer or shifted to a portable media player to be listened to on the move. These techniques using simple equipment allow anybody, with little censorship or licensing control, to broadcast audio-visual material worldwide.
Digital media streaming increases the demand for network bandwidth. For example, standard image quality needs 1 Mbit/s link speed for SD 480p, HD 720p quality requires 2.5 Mbit/s, and the top-of-the-line HDX quality needs 4.5 Mbit/s for 1080p. [66]
Webcams are a low-cost extension of this phenomenon. While some webcams can give full-frame-rate video, the picture either is usually small or updates slowly. Internet users can watch animals around an African waterhole, ships in the Panama Canal , traffic at a local roundabout or monitor their own premises, live and in real time. Video chat rooms and video conferencing are also popular with many uses being found for personal webcams, with and without two-way sound. YouTube was founded on 15 February 2005 and is now the leading website for free streaming video with a vast number of users. It uses a flash -based web player to stream and show video files. Registered users may upload an unlimited amount of video and build their own personal profile. YouTube claims that its users watch hundreds of millions, and upload hundreds of thousands of videos daily. Currently, YouTube also uses an HTML5 player. [67]

Social impact
The Internet has enabled new forms of social interaction, activities, and social associations. This phenomenon has given rise to the scholarly study of the sociology of the Internet .

Users
Internet usage has seen tremendous growth. From 2000 to 2009, the number of Internet users globally rose from 394 million to 1.858 billion. [72] By 2010, 22 percent of the world's population had access to computers with 1 billion Google searches every day, 300 million Internet users reading blogs, and 2 billion videos viewed daily on YouTube . [73] In 2014 the world's Internet users surpassed 3 billion or 43.6 percent of world population, but two-thirds of the users came from richest countries, with 78.0 percent of Europe countries population using the Internet, followed by 57.4 percent of the Americas. [74]
The prevalent language for communication on the Internet has been English. This may be a result of the origin of the Internet, as well as the language's role as a lingua franca . Early computer systems were limited to the characters in the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII), a subset of the Latin alphabet .
After English (27%), the most requested languages on the World Wide Web are Chinese (25%), Spanish (8%), Japanese (5%), Portuguese and German (4% each), Arabic, French and Russian (3% each), and Korean (2%). [70] By region, 42% of the world's Internet users are based in Asia, 24% in Europe, 14% in North America, 10% in Latin America and the Caribbean taken together, 6% in Africa, 3% in the Middle East and 1% in Australia/Oceania. [75] The Internet's technologies have developed enough in recent years, especially in the use of Unicode , that good facilities are available for development and communication in the world's widely used languages. However, some glitches such as mojibake (incorrect display of some languages' characters) still remain.
In an American study in 2005, the percentage of men using the Internet was very slightly ahead of the percentage of women, although this difference reversed in those under 30. Men logged on more often, spent more time online, and were more likely to be broadband users, whereas women tended to make more use of opportunities to communicate (such as email). Men were more likely to use the Internet to pay bills, participate in auctions, and for recreation such as downloading music and videos. Men and women were equally likely to use the Internet for shopping and banking. [76] More recent studies indicate that in 2008, women significantly outnumbered men on most social networking sites, such as Facebook and Myspace, although the ratios varied with age. [77] In addition, women watched more streaming content, whereas men downloaded more. [78] In terms of blogs, men were more likely to blog in the first place; among those who blog, men were more likely to have a professional blog, whereas women were more likely to have a personal blog. [79]
According to forecasts by Euromonitor International , 44% of the world's population will be users of the Internet by 2020. [80] Splitting by country, in 2012 Iceland, Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands, and Denmark had the highest Internet penetration by the number of users , with 93% or more of the population with access. [81]
Several neologisms exist that refer to Internet users: Netizen (as in as in "citizen of the net") [82] refers to those actively involved in improving online communities , the Internet in general or surrounding political affairs and rights such as free speech , [83] [84] Internaut refers to operators or technically highly capable users of the Internet, [85] [86] digital citizen refers to a person using the Internet in order to engage in society, politics, and government participation. [87]

Usage
The Internet allows greater flexibility in working hours and location, especially with the spread of unmetered high-speed connections. The Internet can be accessed almost anywhere by numerous means, including through mobile Internet devices . Mobile phones, datacards , handheld game consoles and cellular routers allow users to connect to the Internet wirelessly . Within the limitations imposed by small screens and other limited facilities of such pocket-sized devices, the services of the Internet, including email and the web, may be available. Service providers may restrict the services offered and mobile data charges may be significantly higher than other access methods.
Educational material at all levels from pre-school to post-doctoral is available from websites. Examples range from CBeebies , through school and high-school revision guides and virtual universities , to access to top-end scholarly literature through the likes of Google Scholar . For distance education , help with homework and other assignments, self-guided learning, whiling away spare time, or just looking up more detail on an interesting fact, it has never been easier for people to access educational information at any level from anywhere. The Internet in general and the World Wide Web in particular are important enablers of both formal and informal education . Further, the Internet allows universities, in particular, researchers from the social and behavioral sciences, to conduct research remotely via virtual laboratories, with profound changes in reach and generalizability of findings as well as in communication between scientists and in the publication of results. [88]
The low cost and nearly instantaneous sharing of ideas, knowledge, and skills have made collaborative work dramatically easier, with the help of collaborative software . Not only can a group cheaply communicate and share ideas but the wide reach of the Internet allows such groups more easily to form. An example of this is the free software movement , which has produced, among other things, Linux , Mozilla Firefox , and OpenOffice.org . Internet chat, whether using an IRC chat room, an instant messaging system, or a social networking website, allows colleagues to stay in touch in a very convenient way while working at their computers during the day. Messages can be exchanged even more quickly and conveniently than via email. These systems may allow files to be exchanged, drawings and images to be shared, or voice and video contact between team members.
Content management systems allow collaborating teams to work on shared sets of documents simultaneously without accidentally destroying each other's work. Business and project teams can share calendars as well as documents and other information. Such collaboration occurs in a wide variety of areas including scientific research, software development, conference planning, political activism and creative writing. Social and political collaboration is also becoming more widespread as both Internet access and computer literacy spread.
The Internet allows computer users to remotely access other computers and information stores easily from any access point. Access may be with computer security , i.e. authentication and encryption technologies, depending on the requirements. This is encouraging new ways of working from home, collaboration and information sharing in many industries. An accountant sitting at home can audit the books of a company based in another country, on a server situated in a third country that is remotely maintained by IT specialists in a fourth. These accounts could have been created by home-working bookkeepers, in other remote locations, based on information emailed to them from offices all over the world. Some of these things were possible before the widespread use of the Internet, but the cost of private leased lines would have made many of them infeasible in practice. An office worker away from their desk, perhaps on the other side of the world on a business trip or a holiday, can access their emails, access their data using cloud computing , or open a remote desktop session into their office PC using a secure virtual private network (VPN) connection on the Internet. This can give the worker complete access to all of their normal files and data, including email and other applications, while away from the office. It has been referred to among system administrators as the Virtual Private Nightmare, [89] because it extends the secure perimeter of a corporate network into remote locations and its employees' homes.

Social networking and entertainment
Many people use the World Wide Web to access news, weather and sports reports, to plan and book vacations and to pursue their personal interests. People use chat , messaging and email to make and stay in touch with friends worldwide, sometimes in the same way as some previously had pen pals . Social networking websites such as Facebook , Twitter , and Myspace have created new ways to socialize and interact. Users of these sites are able to add a wide variety of information to pages, to pursue common interests, and to connect with others. It is also possible to find existing acquaintances, to allow communication among existing groups of people. Sites like LinkedIn foster commercial and business connections. YouTube and Flickr specialize in users' videos and photographs. While social networking sites were initially for individuals only, today they are widely used by businesses and other organizations to promote their brands, to market to their customers and to encourage posts to " go viral ". "Black hat" social media techniques are also employed by some organizations, such as spam accounts and astroturfing .
A risk for both individuals and organizations writing posts (especially public posts) on social networking websites, is that especially foolish or controversial posts occasionally lead to an unexpected and possibly large-scale backlash on social media from other Internet users. This is also a risk in relation to controversial offline behavior, if it is widely made known. The nature of this backlash can range widely from counter-arguments and public mockery, through insults and hate speech , to, in extreme cases, rape and death threats . The online disinhibition effect describes the tendency of many individuals to behave more stridently or offensively online than they would in person. A significant number of feminist women have been the target of various forms of harassment in response to posts they have made on social media, and Twitter in particular has been criticised in the past for not doing enough to aid victims of online abuse. [90]
For organizations, such a backlash can cause overall brand damage , especially if reported by the media. However, this is not always the case, as any brand damage in the eyes of people with an opposing opinion to that presented by the organization could sometimes be outweighed by strengthening the brand in the eyes of others. Furthermore, if an organization or individual gives in to demands that others perceive as wrong-headed, that can then provoke a counter-backlash.
Some websites, such as Reddit , have rules forbidding the posting of personal information of individuals (also known as doxxing ), due to concerns about such postings leading to mobs of large numbers of Internet users directing harassment at the specific individuals thereby identified. In particular, the Reddit rule forbidding the posting of personal information is widely understood to imply that all identifying photos and names must be censored in Facebook screenshots posted to Reddit. However, the interpretation of this rule in relation to public Twitter posts is less clear, and in any case, like-minded people online have many other ways they can use to direct each other's attention to public social media posts they disagree with.
Children also face dangers online such as cyberbullying and approaches by sexual predators , who sometimes pose as children themselves. Children may also encounter material which they may find upsetting, or material which their parents consider to be not age-appropriate. Due to naivety, they may also post personal information about themselves online, which could put them or their families at risk unless warned not to do so. Many parents choose to enable Internet filtering , and/or supervise their children's online activities, in an attempt to protect their children from inappropriate material on the Internet. The most popular social networking websites, such as Facebook and Twitter, commonly forbid users under the age of 13. However, these policies are typically trivial to circumvent by registering an account with a false birth date, and a significant number of children aged under 13 join such sites anyway. Social networking sites for younger children, which claim to provide better levels of protection for children, also exist. [91]
The Internet has been a major outlet for leisure activity since its inception, with entertaining social experiments such as MUDs and MOOs being conducted on university servers, and humor-related Usenet groups receiving much traffic. [ citation needed ] Many Internet forums have sections devoted to games and funny videos. [ citation needed ] The Internet pornography and online gambling industries have taken advantage of the World Wide Web, and often provide a significant source of advertising revenue for other websites. [92] Although many governments have attempted to restrict both industries' use of the Internet, in general, this has failed to stop their widespread popularity. [93]
Another area of leisure activity on the Internet is multiplayer gaming . [94] This form of recreation creates communities, where people of all ages and origins enjoy the fast-paced world of multiplayer games. These range from MMORPG to first-person shooters , from role-playing video games to online gambling . While online gaming has been around since the 1970s, modern modes of online gaming began with subscription services such as GameSpy and MPlayer . [95] Non-subscribers were limited to certain types of game play or certain games. Many people use the Internet to access and download music, movies and other works for their enjoyment and relaxation. Free and fee-based services exist for all of these activities, using centralized servers and distributed peer-to-peer technologies. Some of these sources exercise more care with respect to the original artists' copyrights than others.
Internet usage has been correlated to users' loneliness. [96] Lonely people tend to use the Internet as an outlet for their feelings and to share their stories with others, such as in the " I am lonely will anyone speak to me " thread.
Cybersectarianism is a new organizational form which involves: "highly dispersed small groups of practitioners that may remain largely anonymous within the larger social context and operate in relative secrecy, while still linked remotely to a larger network of believers who share a set of practices and texts, and often a common devotion to a particular leader. Overseas supporters provide funding and support; domestic practitioners distribute tracts, participate in acts of resistance, and share information on the internal situation with outsiders. Collectively, members and practitioners of such sects construct viable virtual communities of faith, exchanging personal testimonies and engaging in the collective study via email, on-line chat rooms, and web-based message boards." [97] In particular, the British government has raised concerns about the prospect of young British Muslims being indoctrinated into Islamic extremism by material on the Internet, being persuaded to join terrorist groups such as the so-called " Islamic State ", and then potentially committing acts of terrorism on returning to Britain after fighting in Syria or Iraq.
Cyberslacking can become a drain on corporate resources; the average UK employee spent 57 minutes a day surfing the Web while at work, according to a 2003 study by Peninsula Business Services. [98] Internet addiction disorder is excessive computer use that interferes with daily life. Nicholas G. Carr believes that Internet use has other effects on individuals , for instance improving skills of scan-reading and interfering with the deep thinking that leads to true creativity. [99]

Electronic business
Electronic business ( e-business ) encompasses business processes spanning the entire value chain : purchasing, supply chain management , marketing , sales , customer service, and business relationship. E-commerce seeks to add revenue streams using the Internet to build and enhance relationships with clients and partners. According to International Data Corporation , the size of worldwide e-commerce, when global business-to-business and -consumer transactions are combined, equate to $16 trillion for 2013. A report by Oxford Economics adds those two together to estimate the total size of the digital economy at $20.4 trillion, equivalent to roughly 13.8% of global sales. [100]
While much has been written of the economic advantages of Internet-enabled commerce , there is also evidence that some aspects of the Internet such as maps and location-aware services may serve to reinforce economic inequality and the digital divide . [101] Electronic commerce may be responsible for consolidation and the decline of mom-and-pop , brick and mortar businesses resulting in increases in income inequality . [102] [103] [104]
Author Andrew Keen , a long-time critic of the social transformations caused by the Internet, has recently focused on the economic effects of consolidation from Internet businesses. Keen cites a 2013 Institute for Local Self-Reliance report saying brick-and-mortar retailers employ 47 people for every $10 million in sales while Amazon employs only 14. Similarly, the 700-employee room rental start-up Airbnb was valued at $10 billion in 2014, about half as much as Hilton Hotels , which employs 152,000 people. And car-sharing Internet startup Uber employs 1,000 full-time employees and is valued at $18.2 billion, about the same valuation as Avis and Hertz combined, which together employ almost 60,000 people. [105]

Telecommuting
Telecommuting is the performance within a traditional worker and employer relationship when it is facilitated by tools such as groupware , virtual private networks , conference calling , videoconferencing , and voice over IP (VOIP) so that work may be performed from any location, most conveniently the worker's home. It can be efficient and useful for companies as it allows workers to communicate over long distances, saving significant amounts of travel time and cost. As broadband Internet connections become commonplace, more workers have adequate bandwidth at home to use these tools to link their home to their corporate intranet and internal communication networks.

Crowdsourcing
The Internet provides a particularly good venue for crowdsourcing , because individuals tend to be more open in web-based projects where they are not being physically judged or scrutinized and thus can feel more comfortable sharing. [ citation needed ]

Collaborative publishing
Wikis have also been used in the academic community for sharing and dissemination of information across institutional and international boundaries. [106] In those settings, they have been found useful for collaboration on grant writing , strategic planning , departmental documentation, and committee work. [107] The United States Patent and Trademark Office uses a wiki to allow the public to collaborate on finding prior art relevant to examination of pending patent applications. Queens , New York has used a wiki to allow citizens to collaborate on the design and planning of a local park. [108] The English Wikipedia has the largest user base among wikis on the World Wide Web [109] and ranks in the top 10 among all Web sites in terms of traffic. [110]

Politics and political revolutions
The Internet has achieved new relevance as a political tool. The presidential campaign of Howard Dean in 2004 in the United States was notable for its success in soliciting donation via the Internet. Many political groups use the Internet to achieve a new method of organizing for carrying out their mission, having given rise to Internet activism , most notably practiced by rebels in the Arab Spring . [111] [112] The New York Times suggested that social media websites, such as Facebook and Twitter, helped people organize the political revolutions in Egypt, by helping activists organize protests, communicate grievances, and disseminate information. [113]
The potential of the Internet as a civic tool of communicative power was explored by Simon R. B. Berdal in his 2004 thesis:
Berdal, therefore, extends the Habermasian notion of the public sphere to the Internet, and underlines the inherent global and civic nature that interwoven Internet technologies provide. To limit the growing civic potential of the Internet, Berdal also notes how "self-protective measures" are put in place by those threatened by it:
Incidents of politically motivated Internet censorship have now been recorded in many countries, including western democracies.

Philanthropy
The spread of low-cost Internet access in developing countries has opened up new possibilities for peer-to-peer charities, which allow individuals to contribute small amounts to charitable projects for other individuals. Websites, such as DonorsChoose and GlobalGiving , allow small-scale donors to direct funds to individual projects of their choice. A popular twist on Internet-based philanthropy is the use of peer-to-peer lending for charitable purposes. Kiva pioneered this concept in 2005, offering the first web-based service to publish individual loan profiles for funding. Kiva raises funds for local intermediary microfinance organizations which post stories and updates on behalf of the borrowers. Lenders can contribute as little as $25 to loans of their choice, and receive their money back as borrowers repay. Kiva falls short of being a pure peer-to-peer charity, in that loans are disbursed before being funded by lenders and borrowers do not communicate with lenders themselves. [115] [116]
However, the recent spread of low-cost Internet access in developing countries has made genuine international person-to-person philanthropy increasingly feasible. In 2009, the US-based nonprofit Zidisha tapped into this trend to offer the first person-to-person microfinance platform to link lenders and borrowers across international borders without intermediaries. Members can fund loans for as little as a dollar, which the borrowers then use to develop business activities that improve their families' incomes while repaying loans to the members with interest. Borrowers access the Internet via public cybercafes, donated laptops in village schools, and even smart phones, then create their own profile pages through which they share photos and information about themselves and their businesses. As they repay their loans, borrowers continue to share updates and dialogue with lenders via their profile pages. This direct web-based connection allows members themselves to take on many of the communication and recording tasks traditionally performed by local organizations, bypassing geographic barriers and dramatically reducing the cost of microfinance services to the entrepreneurs. [117]

Security
Internet resources, hardware, and software components are the target of criminal or malicious attempts to gain unauthorized control to cause interruptions, commit fraud, engage in blackmail or access private information.

Malware
Malicious software used and spread on the Internet includes computer viruses which copy with the help of humans, computer worms which copy themselves automatically, software for denial of service attacks , ransomware , botnets , and spyware that reports on the activity and typing of users. Usually, these activities constitute cybercrime . Defense theorists have also speculated about the possibilities of cyber warfare using similar methods on a large scale. [ citation needed ]

Surveillance
The vast majority of computer surveillance involves the monitoring of data and traffic on the Internet. [118] In the United States for example, under the Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act , all phone calls and broadband Internet traffic (emails, web traffic, instant messaging, etc.) are required to be available for unimpeded real-time monitoring by Federal law enforcement agencies. [119] [120] [121] Packet capture is the monitoring of data traffic on a computer network . Computers communicate over the Internet by breaking up messages (emails, images, videos, web pages, files, etc.) into small chunks called "packets", which are routed through a network of computers, until they reach their destination, where they are assembled back into a complete "message" again. Packet Capture Appliance intercepts these packets as they are traveling through the network, in order to examine their contents using other programs. A packet capture is an information gathering tool, but not an analysis tool. That is it gathers "messages" but it does not analyze them and figure out what they mean. Other programs are needed to perform traffic analysis and sift through intercepted data looking for important/useful information. Under the Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act all U.S. telecommunications providers are required to install packet sniffing technology to allow Federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies to intercept all of their customers' broadband Internet and voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) traffic. [122]
The large amount of data gathered from packet capturing requires surveillance software that filters and reports relevant information, such as the use of certain words or phrases, the access of certain types of web sites, or communicating via email or chat with certain parties. [123] Agencies, such as the Information Awareness Office , NSA , GCHQ and the FBI , spend billions of dollars per year to develop, purchase, implement, and operate systems for interception and analysis of data. [124] Similar systems are operated by Iranian secret police to identify and suppress dissidents. The required hardware and software was allegedly installed by German Siemens AG and Finnish Nokia . [125]

Censorship
Some governments, such as those of Burma , Iran , North Korea , the Mainland China , Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates restrict access to content on the Internet within their territories, especially to political and religious content, with domain name and keyword filters. [130]
In Norway, Denmark, Finland, and Sweden, major Internet service providers have voluntarily agreed to restrict access to sites listed by authorities. While this list of forbidden resources is supposed to contain only known child pornography sites, the content of the list is secret. [131] Many countries, including the United States, have enacted laws against the possession or distribution of certain material, such as child pornography , via the Internet, but do not mandate filter software. Many free or commercially available software programs, called content-control software are available to users to block offensive websites on individual computers or networks, in order to limit access by children to pornographic material or depiction of violence.

Performance
As the Internet is a heterogeneous network, the physical characteristics, including for example the data transfer rates of connections, vary widely. It exhibits emergent phenomena that depend on its large-scale organization. [ citation needed ]

Outages
An Internet blackout or outage can be caused by local signalling interruptions. Disruptions of submarine communications cables may cause blackouts or slowdowns to large areas, such as in the 2008 submarine cable disruption . Less-developed countries are more vulnerable due to a small number of high-capacity links. Land cables are also vulnerable, as in 2011 when a woman digging for scrap metal severed most connectivity for the nation of Armenia. [132] Internet blackouts affecting almost entire countries can be achieved by governments as a form of Internet censorship , as in the blockage of the Internet in Egypt , whereby approximately 93% [133] of networks were without access in 2011 in an attempt to stop mobilization for anti-government protests . [134]

Energy use
In 2011, researchers estimated the energy used by the Internet to be between 170 and 307 GW, less than two percent of the energy used by humanity. This estimate included the energy needed to build, operate, and periodically replace the estimated 750 million laptops, a billion smart phones and 100 million servers worldwide as well as the energy that routers, cell towers, optical switches, Wi-Fi transmitters and cloud storage devices use when transmitting Internet traffic. [135] [136]

Wikipedia Review
Wikipedia Review is an Internet forum and blog for the discussion of Wikimedia projects, in particular the content and conflicts of Wikipedia . [4] [5] An InformationWeek Grok on Google blog described Wikipedia Review as "one of a number of Wikipedia watchdog" websites, "dedicated to scrutinizing Wikipedia and reporting on its flaws". [6] It provides an independent forum to discuss Wikipedia editors and their influence on Wikipedia content. At its peak, participants included current Wikipedia editors, former Wikipedia editors, a few users banned from Wikipedia, and people who have never edited. [7]

Background
The site was founded in November 2005 by "Igor Alexander", and hosted by ProBoards . [2] On 19 February 2006 it moved to its own domain name using Invision Power Board software. [3] [8] The site requires registration using a valid e-mail address to post. It blacklists email providers which allow anonymity, which it says is to discourage the operation of multiple accounts by a single user . [9]
Wikipedia Review has been cited for its discussion and evaluation of concepts surrounding wiki -editing, such as the Palo Alto Research Company 's WikiDashboard, [10] [11] as well as used as an evaluation subject for the tool. [12]

Commentary
Seth Finkelstein wrote in The Guardian that Wikipedia Review has provided a focal point for investigation into Wikipedia-related matters such as the " Essjay controversy ". [14] [15] Cade Metz, writing for The Register , credited Wikipedia Review with the discovery of a private mailing list that led to the resignation of a Wikipedia administrator; he also wrote that a Wikipedia proposal called "BADSITES" intended to ban the mention of Wikipedia Review and similar sites on Wikipedia. [16] [17] The Independent noted that "allegations against certain administrators came to a head on a site called Wikipedia Review, where people debate the administrators' actions." [18] The Irish technology website Silicon Republic suggested visiting Wikipedia Review in order to "follow disputes, discussions, editors and general bureaucracy on Wikipedia". [19] Philip Coppens used posts made on Wikipedia Review to help construct a report, published in Nexus Magazine , on WikiScanner and allegations that intelligence agencies had been using Wikipedia to spread disinformation . [20]

Content and structure
Wikipedia Review's publicly accessible forums are broken up into four general topic areas:

Salt Lake City Weekly
Salt Lake City Weekly (usually shortened to City Weekly ) is a free alternative weekly tabloid -paged newspaper published in Salt Lake City, Utah . It began as Private Eye . City Weekly is published and dated for every Thursday by Copperfield Publishing Inc. of which John Saltas is majority owner and president.

History
John Saltas founded what would become Salt Lake City Weekly in June 1984. He called his monthly publication Private Eye because it contained news and promotions for bars and dance clubs, which due to Utah State liquor laws were all private clubs. Saltas originally mailed the Private Eye as a newsletter to private club members. State law forbade private clubs from advertising at the time, so Saltas' newsletter was the only way for clubs to provide promotional information.
In 1988 Private Eye became a bi-weekly newspaper although it was available mostly in clubs. Distribution of the paper broadened as new liquor rule interpretations at the Utah Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control (DABC) allowed mainstream media to carry club advertisements as long as they weren't "soliciting" members. Private Eye thus ended its mailed period and was available for free in public distribution outlets for the first time. In 1989, Private Eye was admitted to the Association of Alternative Newsweeklies (AAN), the organization's 40th member. [2]

Private Eye Weekly
In 1992 Private Eye Weekly emerged as a weekly tabloid -style alternative paper with distribution outlets in Salt Lake City, Ogden, Park City and Utah County. Saltas hired his first editor, then- KSL-TV journalist Tom Walsh, a veteran writer with experience from the alternative Phoenix New Times , who took a significant salary cut because of his enthusiasm for the new paper. [2]
Early contributors to Private Eye included Ben Fulton (who served as editor-in-chief until spring 2007), Christopher Smart (currently a reporter for The Salt Lake Tribune ), Mary Dickson, Katharine Biele, Lynn Packer, and notable Utah defense attorney Ron Yengich .
From 1992 onward, reporter Lynn Packer scooped many stories about then-Salt Lake City Mayor Deedee Corradini , and Bonneville Pacific, an energy company. [3] Ron Yengich's relationship with the paper would end days after he was retained as Corradini's attorney in 1996. Yengich had mocked the mayor in a Private Eye column just days before becoming her representative. [4]
Tom Walsh left the paper in June 1996 to become executive of another alternative weekly, the Miami New Times . [2] Private Eye hosted the annual AAN convention on 29–31 May 1996, after Walsh had announced his resignation.
During 1996, the newspaper's page count outgrew the capacity of independent Salt Lake City presses, so the paper made printing arrangements with the publisher of the Ogden Standard-Examiner . Content for City Weekly is sent via computer to the press in Ogden, Utah , and bundles of printed papers are trucked south to Salt Lake City for distribution. The paper also began posting all content online in 1996, originally using the URL www.avenews.com. City Weekly is currently available at www.cityweekly.net , and starting in 2005 began posting additional information on a sister-commerce site, cwlistings.com .
In the early 1990s the paper began giving out yearly awards based on reader votes and staff input. The categories and pages devoted to the "Best of Utah" issues expanded over time, and these issues are typically the year's largest. Many establishments proudly display City Weekly "Best of..." awards, and often have several years' worth mounted above the cash register.
In 1996 the paper began recognizing local music in the "SLAMMY awards" (Salt Lake Area Music & More). As with the "Best of Utah" issues, locals are encouraged to vote for their favorite local bands and albums in different categories. The paper also hosts a party featuring several of the winners.

Salt Lake City Weekly
In 1997 the growing paper changed its name to Salt Lake City Weekly , abbreviated to City Weekly on the masthead. Many people misunderstood the paper's original name, assuming that the Private Eye was a detective agency . [5]
The paper published stories of the 2002 Winter Olympics bribery scandal . Discoveries that International Olympic Committee members apparently accepted gifts in return for votes to select Salt Lake City as the Olympic host erupted into an internationally significant story in 1999 and 2000.
During the late 1990s, a suit to allow club and liquor advertising began making its way through local courts. City Weekly had tried and failed to persuade the state's Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control to lift Utah's peculiar restrictions on liquor advertising. National media like Wall Street Journal and USA Today were published without constraints on their advertising. [6] The case dragged on for years in Utah District Court before Judge David Sam , who rejected the claim that advertising liquor in Utah was bound by national precedent. [7] The Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals overturned this ruling on 24 July 2001, when the court remanded plaintiff's request for appeal on the district court's ruling to deny preliminary injunction . [8] The Tenth Circuit stated that the plaintiffs satisfied requirements for an injunction, forcing the state to allow liquor advertising. In August the Utah Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission began drafting amendments to legalize liquor advertising in print, in restaurants, and on billboards. The LDS Church thought that the Commission's proposed changes went too far and urged retention of the old rules. [9] Saltas chided the Church in an editorial, but offered them a free full-page ad so they could explain their position against liquor advertising. The Church had not previously advertised in the paper, which was often considered anti-Mormon , but they accepted Saltas' offer. On 29 November 2001, City Weekly published the LDS statement. The same issue carried the paper's first liquor ad, for Jim Beam . Saltas told the Tribune that the timing was "just an ironic coincidence." [10]
In October 2002, editor Christopher Smart left City Weekly for a reporting position with The Salt Lake Tribune . Saltas named John Yewell as editor; his tenure lasted nine months. Associate editor Ben Fulton was named editor pro-tem, and later was given the post. Fulton ran the paper until April 2007, garnering several awards, including a Hearst Award for long-form journalism, as well as several first-place awards from the Utah Chapter Society of Professional Journalists and the Utah Press Association.
As the paper gained popularity and staff, the load on John Saltas decreased. In 2003 he stepped aside as publisher, naming Jim Rizzi, who had been hired in 2002 as a vice-president, as his successor. After being uninvolved with the paper's operations for several months, Saltas was asked to contribute a weekly column. Saltas now writes a light-hearted, somewhat blog -like column called "Private Eye", discussing his favorite Utah Jazz players, his Greek heritage, and jokes that he would soon be fired.
In April 2007 Holly Mullen was announced as the paper's new editor. She had been an area journalist for nine years, most recently (until January 2007) as a columnist for The Salt Lake Tribune. In addition to her renown as a liberal reporter and writer, she is now noted as the wife of former Salt Lake City Mayor Ted Wilson . On 26 February 2009, Mullen informed her friends through her Facebook profile that she had parted ways with the paper. At the same time, longtime City Weekly Managing Editor Jerre Wroble was promoted to the Editor position; she left the paper in 2013, replaced in 2014 by Rachel Piper. She returned to guide the paper for a year (January 2015-5 May 2016) when Piper departed. [11]
Salt Lake City Weekly is currently available at over 2,000 locations, including sites outside the Salt Lake Valley (such as the Tooele Valley). The paper is found online at www.cityweekly.net. The 55,000 weekly Circulation for City Weekly is independently audited by Verified Audit and has been so for nearly 20 years.
In 2009, the Utah SPJ awarded Salt Lake City Weekly 13 journalism awards:
John Saltas became the publisher again in May 2012. [13] His General Manager was Andy Sutcliffe until 2015.

Publishers

City Weekly
In its origin as a publication promoting Salt Lake City-area nightlife during a time when state alcohol regulations were more strict, City Weekly developed a reputation for its tendency to challenge established viewpoints—a reputation which now extends to the paper's coverage of local politics.
Apart from covering scandals about former Democratic Salt Lake City Mayor Deedee Corradini , the paper controversially editorialized against her and her associates. The paper often listed her actions as "misses" in the "Hits & Misses" column on the opinion page.
City Weekly attacks on district attorney Neal Gunnarson so upset him that he stole hundreds of copies of the paper from the racks in 1997. Technically, this is theft because only the first copy of each publication is free; additional copies are one dollar each. An article appearing in the issue posited that Gunnarson was being too soft on Mayor Corradini, claiming that his weak prosecution didn't "pass the smell test."
During the 1999 mayoral elections, the scandal-ridden Corradini declined to seek re-election. City Weekly endorsed Rocky Anderson in a crowded primary. Anderson had been retained by the paper as an attorney on occasion. Facing Stuart Reid, a member of Corradini's administration, Anderson won, but the paper remained neutral during his 2003 re-election. However, during Anderson's second term, he was visiting another city and crossed a police picket line in order to attend a scheduled meeting. He later remarked to a reporter that the line was not a picket line, but a demonstration, so there was no harm in crossing. This did not sit well with John Saltas, who viewed it as a repudiation of a useful labor negotiating tactic, and since that time Saltas has made several critical comments toward the Mayor in his columns.
In 2004, City Weekly published a series of articles criticizing embattled Salt Lake County mayor Nancy Workman . Workman was acquitted of criminal charges for misuse of County funds, but was forced out as a candidate by vote of the Salt Lake County Republican Party Central Committee. The Central Committee then proceeded to nominate and accept by acclamation candidate and developer Ellis Ivory. In the ensuing election Ivory was defeated by Democrat Peter Corroon .

Relationships to other Salt Lake papers
City Weekly comments extensively on local media through a "media beat" column and letters from the editor. In 2006 the major newspapers (through their joint publishing arm, MediaOne, formerly the Newspaper Agency Corporation ) launched In Utah This Week , a free weekly events-oriented newspaper. Throughout the alternative newspaper industry, such publications produced by a city daily are referred to as Fake Alts, or FauxAlts. In Utah This Week ceased publication a few years later.
Saltas has mocked the Tribune 's byline "Utah's Independent Voice" by calling the paper "Utah's co-dependent voice." The paper, he points out, is published with the same MediaOne facilities as the two paper's joint operating agreement . Thus City Weekly casts the paper as being "less independent than it pretends to be."
The 2002 Tribune acquisition by Dean Singleton , owner of the nation's 7th largest newspaper chain, prompted an exposé . City Weekly asserted that increased cooperation and expansion of the two daily papers under Singleton's Tribune leadership hurt surrounding papers' viability. The Tribune has hired two former reporters of the City Weekly, while City Weekly has hired several former Tribune reporters over the same time span, with moves in both directions affirming the legitimacy of news reporting in City Weekly. After emerging from bankruptcy in 2010, MediaNews Group lost control of the Tribune to a hedge fund, Alden Global Capital. As of May 2016, sale of The Tribune to a local businessman is being negotiated. [14]

Current features
City Weekly tends to be geared toward a younger, more urban, and more liberal audience than the area's other papers. Its features include its reviews of art films (Scott Renshaw), restaurants (Ted Scheffler), local music groups, scheduled art shows and events, and television (Bill Frost). Founder Saltas writes a stream-of-thought column called "Private Eye." Katharine Biele writes an opinion-briefs feature called "Hits & Misses". Until 2014 the paper had a satire column called "Deep End" written by D.P. Sorensen who, among other things, jokingly claimed to have been Mitt Romney 's missionary companion. It also carries syndicated columns "News Quirks" by Roland Sweet, and the Straight Dope , by Chicago-based Cecil Adams, Free Will Astrology and comics such as Tom Tomorrow 's This Modern World , and Keith Knight 's K Chronicles . The paper has also expanded its online content in recent years, including featured blogs from Gavin Sheehan .
City Weekly publishes a number of special issues each year, including the Best of Utah guide and the City Weekly Music Awards (formerly SLAMMys ) issue (see also Music of Utah ).

Bibcode
The bibcode (also known as the refcode ) is a compact identifier used by several astronomical data systems to uniquely specify literature references.

Adoption
The Bibliographic Reference Code (refcode) was originally developed to be used in SIMBAD and the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED), but it became a de facto standard and is now used more widely, for example, by the NASA Astrophysics Data System who coined and prefer the term "bibcode". [1] [2]

Format
The code has a fixed length of 19 characters and has the form
where YYYY is the four-digit year of the reference and JJJJJ is a code indicating where the reference was published. In the case of a journal reference, VVVV is the volume number, M indicates the section of the journal where the reference was published (e.g., L for a letters section), PPPP gives the starting page number, and A is the first letter of the last name of the first author. Periods ( . ) are used to fill unused fields and to pad fields out to their fixed length if too short; padding is done on the right for the publication code and on the left for the volume number and page number. [1] [2] Page numbers greater than 9999 are continued in the M column. The 6-digit article ID numbers (in lieu of page numbers) used by the Physical Review publications since the late 1990s are treated as follows: The first two digits of the article ID, corresponding to the issue number, are converted to a lower-case letter (01 = a etc.) and inserted into column M . The remaining four digits are used in the page field. [2]

Examples
Some examples of the code are:

International Standard Book Number
The International Standard Book Number ( ISBN ) is a unique [a] [b] numeric commercial book identifier .
An ISBN is assigned to each edition and variation (except reprintings) of a book. For example, an e-book , a paperback and a hardcover edition of the same book would each have a different ISBN. The ISBN is 13 digits long if assigned on or after 1 January 2007, and 10 digits long if assigned before 2007. The method of assigning an ISBN is nation-based and varies from country to country, often depending on how large the publishing industry is within a country.
The initial ISBN configuration of recognition was generated in 1967 based upon the 9-digit Standard Book Numbering ( SBN ) created in 1966. The 10-digit ISBN format was developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and was published in 1970 as international standard ISO 2108 (the SBN code can be converted to a ten digit ISBN by prefixing it with a zero).
Occasionally, a book may appear without a printed ISBN if it is printed privately or the author does not follow the usual ISBN procedure; however, this can be rectified later. [1]
Another identifier, the International Standard Serial Number (ISSN), identifies periodical publications such as magazines ; and the International Standard Music Number (ISMN) covers for musical scores.

History
The Standard Book Numbering (SBN) code is a 9-digit commercial book identifier system created by Gordon Foster , Emeritus Professor of Statistics at Trinity College, Dublin , [2] for the booksellers and stationers WHSmith and others in 1965. [3] The ISBN configuration of recognition was generated in 1967 in the United Kingdom by David Whitaker [4] (regarded as the "Father of the ISBN" [5] ) and in 1968 in the US by Emery Koltay [4] (who later became director of the U.S. ISBN agency R.R. Bowker ). [5] [6] [7]
The 10-digit ISBN format was developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and was published in 1970 as international standard ISO 2108. [3] [4] The United Kingdom continued to use the 9-digit SBN code until 1974. ISO has appointed the International ISBN Agency as the registration authority for ISBN worldwide and the ISBN Standard is developed under the control of ISO Technical Committee 46/Subcommittee 9 TC 46/SC 9 . The ISO on-line facility only refers back to 1978. [8]
An SBN may be converted to an ISBN by prefixing the digit "0". For example, the second edition of Mr. J. G. Reeder Returns , published by Hodder in 1965, has "SBN 340 01381 8" – 340 indicating the publisher, 01381 their serial number, and 8 being the check digit. This can be converted to ISBN 0-340-01381-8 ; the check digit does not need to be re-calculated.
Since 1 January 2007, ISBNs have contained 13 digits, a format that is compatible with " Bookland " European Article Number EAN -13s. [9]

Overview
An ISBN is assigned to each edition and variation (except reprintings) of a book. For example, an ebook, a paperback, and a hardcover edition of the same book would each have a different ISBN. [10] The ISBN is 13 digits long if assigned on or after 1 January 2007, and 10 digits long if assigned before 2007. An International Standard Book Number consists of 4 parts (if it is a 10 digit ISBN) or 5 parts (for a 13 digit ISBN):
A 13-digit ISBN can be separated into its parts ( prefix element , registration group , registrant , publication and check digit ), and when this is done it is customary to separate the parts with hyphens or spaces. Separating the parts ( registration group , registrant , publication and check digit ) of a 10-digit ISBN is also done with either hyphens or spaces. Figuring out how to correctly separate a given ISBN number is complicated, because most of the parts do not use a fixed number of digits. [13]

How ISBNs are issued
ISBN issuance is country-specific, in that ISBNs are issued by the ISBN registration agency that is responsible for that country or territory regardless of the publication language. The ranges of ISBNs assigned to any particular country are based on the publishing profile of the country concerned, and so the ranges will vary depending on the number of books and the number, type, and size of publishers that are active. Some ISBN registration agencies are based in national libraries or within ministries of culture and thus may receive direct funding from government to support their services. In other cases, the ISBN registration service is provided by organisations such as bibliographic data providers that are not government funded. In Canada, ISBNs are issued at no cost with the stated purpose of encouraging Canadian culture. [14] In the United Kingdom, United States, and some other countries, where the service is provided by non-government-funded organisations, the issuing of ISBNs requires payment of a fee.

United States: In the United States, the privately held company R.R. Bowker issues ISBNs. [4] There is a charge that varies depending upon the number of ISBNs purchased, with prices starting at $125.00 for a single number. Access is immediate when requested via their website. [28]
Publishers and authors in other countries obtain ISBNs from their respective national ISBN registration agency. A directory of ISBN agencies is available on the International ISBN Agency website.

Registration group identifier
The registration group identifier is a 1- to 5-digit number that is valid within a single prefix element (i.e. one of 978 or 979). [11] Registration group identifiers have primarily been allocated within the 978 prefix element. [29] The single-digit group identifiers within the 978 prefix element are: 0 or 1 for English-speaking countries; 2 for French-speaking countries; 3 for German-speaking countries; 4 for Japan; 5 for Russian-speaking countries; and 7 for People's Republic of China. An example 5-digit group identifier is 99936, for Bhutan . The allocated group IDs are: 0–5, 600–621, 7, 80–94, 950–989, 9926–9989, and 99901–99976. [30] Books published in rare languages typically have longer group identifiers. [31]
Within the 979 prefix element, the registration group identifier 0 is reserved for compatibility with International Standard Music Numbers (ISMNs), but such material is not actually assigned an ISBN. [11] The registration group identifiers within prefix element 979 that have been assigned are 10 for France, 11 for the Republic of Korea, and 12 for Italy. [32]
The original 9-digit standard book number (SBN) had no registration group identifier, but prefixing a zero (0) to a 9-digit SBN creates a valid 10-digit ISBN.

Registrant element
The national ISBN agency assigns the registrant element ( cf. Category:ISBN agencies ) and an accompanying series of ISBNs within that registrant element to the publisher; the publisher then allocates one of the ISBNs to each of its books. In most countries, a book publisher is not required by law to assign an ISBN; however, most bookstores only handle ISBN bearing publications. [ citation needed ]
A listing of more than 900,000 assigned publisher codes is published, and can be ordered in book form ( € 1399, US$ 1959). The web site of the ISBN agency does not offer any free method of looking up publisher codes. [33] Partial lists have been compiled (from library catalogs) for the English-language groups: identifier 0 and identifier 1 .
Publishers receive blocks of ISBNs, with larger blocks allotted to publishers expecting to need them; a small publisher may receive ISBNs of one or more digits for the registration group identifier, several digits for the registrant, and a single digit for the publication element. Once that block of ISBNs is used, the publisher may receive another block of ISBNs, with a different registrant element. Consequently, a publisher may have different allotted registrant elements. There also may be more than one registration group identifier used in a country. This might occur once all the registrant elements from a particular registration group have been allocated to publishers.
By using variable block lengths, registration agencies are able to customise the allocations of ISBNs that they make to publishers. For example, a large publisher may be given a block of ISBNs where fewer digits are allocated for the registrant element and many digits are allocated for the publication element; likewise, countries publishing many titles have few allocated digits for the registration group identifier and many for the registrant and publication elements. [34] Here are some sample ISBN-10 codes, illustrating block length variations.

Pattern for English language ISBNs
English-language registration group elements are 0 and 1 (2 of more than 220 registration group elements). These two registration group elements are divided into registrant elements in a systematic pattern, which allows their length to be determined, as follows: [35]

Check digits
A check digit is a form of redundancy check used for error detection , the decimal equivalent of a binary check bit . It consists of a single digit computed from the other digits in the number. The method for the ten digit code is an extension of that for SBNs, the two systems are compatible, and SBN prefixed with "0" will give the same check-digit as without – the digit is base eleven, and can be 0-9 or X. The system for thirteen digit codes is not compatible and will, in general, give a different check digit from the corresponding 10 digit ISBN, and does not provide the same protection against transposition. This is because the thirteen digit code was required to be compatible with the EAN format, and hence could not contain an "X".

ISBN-10 check digits
The 2001 edition of the official manual of the International ISBN Agency says that the ISBN-10 check digit [36] – which is the last digit of the ten-digit ISBN – must range from 0 to 10 (the symbol X is used for 10), and must be such that the sum of all the ten digits, each multiplied by its (integer) weight, descending from 10 to 1, is a multiple of 11 .
For example, for an ISBN-10 of 0-306-40615-2:
Formally, using modular arithmetic , we can say:
It is also true for ISBN-10's that the sum of all the ten digits, each multiplied by its weight in ascending order from 1 to 10, is a multiple of 11. For this example:
Formally, we can say:
The two most common errors in handling an ISBN (e.g., typing or writing it) are a single altered digit or the transposition of adjacent digits. It can be proved that all possible valid ISBN-10's have at least two digits different from each other. It can also be proved that there are no pairs of valid ISBN-10's with eight identical digits and two transposed digits. (These are true only because the ISBN is less than 11 digits long, and because 11 is a prime number .) The ISBN check digit method therefore ensures that it will always be possible to detect these two most common types of error, i.e. if either of these types of error has occurred, the result will never be a valid ISBN – the sum of the digits multiplied by their weights will never be a multiple of 11. However, if the error occurs in the publishing house and goes undetected, the book will be issued with an invalid ISBN. [37]
In contrast, it is possible for other types of error, such as two altered non-transposed digits, or three altered digits, to result in a valid ISBN number (although it is still unlikely).

ISBN-10 check digit calculation
Modular arithmetic is convenient for calculating the check digit using modulus 11. Each of the first nine digits of the ten-digit ISBN—excluding the check digit itself—is multiplied by a number in a sequence from 10 to 2, and the remainder of the sum, with respect to 11, is computed. The resulting remainder, plus the check digit, must equal a multiple of 11 (either 0 or 11). Therefore, the check digit is (11 minus the remainder of the sum of the products modulo 11) modulo 11. Taking the remainder modulo 11 a second time accounts for the possibility that the first remainder is 0. Without the second modulo operation the calculation could end up with 11 – 0 = 11 which is invalid. (Strictly speaking the first "modulo 11" is unneeded, but it may be considered to simplify the calculation.)
For example, the check digit for an ISBN-10 of 0-306-40615- ? is calculated as follows:
Thus the check digit is 2, and the complete sequence is ISBN 0-306-40615-2. The value x 10 {\displaystyle x_{10}} required to satisfy this condition might be 10; if so, an 'X' should be used.
It is possible to avoid the multiplications in a software implementation by using two accumulators. Repeatedly adding t into s computes the necessary multiples:
The modular reduction can be done once at the end, as shown above (in which case s could hold a value as large as 496, for the invalid ISBN 99999-999-9-X), or s and t could be reduced by a conditional subtract after each addition.

ISBN-13 check digit calculation
The 2005 edition of the International ISBN Agency's official manual [38] describes how the 13-digit ISBN check digit is calculated. The ISBN-13 check digit, which is the last digit of the ISBN, must range from 0 to 9 and must be such that the sum of all the thirteen digits, each multiplied by its (integer) weight, alternating between 1 and 3, is a multiple of 10 .
Formally, using modular arithmetic , we can say:
The calculation of an ISBN-13 check digit begins with the first 12 digits of the thirteen-digit ISBN (thus excluding the check digit itself). Each digit, from left to right, is alternately multiplied by 1 or 3, then those products are summed modulo 10 to give a value ranging from 0 to 9. Subtracted from 10, that leaves a result from 1 to 10. A zero (0) replaces a ten (10), so, in all cases, a single check digit results.
For example, the ISBN-13 check digit of 978-0-306-40615- ? is calculated as follows:
Thus, the check digit is 7, and the complete sequence is ISBN 978-0-306-40615-7.
In general, the ISBN-13 check digit is calculated as follows.
Let
Then
This check system – similar to the UPC check digit formula – does not catch all errors of adjacent digit transposition. Specifically, if the difference between two adjacent digits is 5, the check digit will not catch their transposition. For instance, the above example allows this situation with the 6 followed by a 1. The correct order contributes 3×6+1×1 = 19 to the sum; while, if the digits are transposed (1 followed by a 6), the contribution of those two digits will be 3×1+1×6 = 9. However, 19 and 9 are congruent modulo 10, and so produce the same, final result: both ISBNs will have a check digit of 7. The ISBN-10 formula uses the prime modulus 11 which avoids this blind spot, but requires more than the digits 0-9 to express the check digit.
Additionally, if the sum of the 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, and 12th digits is tripled then added to the remaining digits (1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th, and 13th), the total will always be divisible by 10 (i.e., end in 0).

ISBN-10 to ISBN-13 conversion
The conversion is quite simple as one only needs to prefix "978" to the existing number and calculate the new checksum using the ISBN-13 algorithm.

Errors in usage
Publishers and libraries have varied policies about the use of the ISBN check digit. Publishers sometimes fail to check the correspondence of a book title and its ISBN before publishing it; that failure causes book identification problems for libraries, booksellers, and readers. [39] For example, ISBN 0-590-76484-5 is shared by two books – Ninja gaiden® : a novel based on the best-selling game by Tecmo (1990) and Wacky Laws (1997), both published by Scholastic .
Most libraries and booksellers display the book record for an invalid ISBN issued by the publisher. The Library of Congress catalogue contains books published with invalid ISBNs, which it usually tags with the phrase "Cancelled ISBN". [40] However, book-ordering systems such as Amazon.com will not search for a book if an invalid ISBN is entered to its search engine. [ citation needed ] OCLC often indexes by invalid ISBNs, if the book is indexed in that way by a member library.

eISBN
Only the term "ISBN" should be used; the terms "eISBN" and "e-ISBN" have historically been sources of confusion and should be avoided. If a book exists in one or more digital ( e-book ) formats, each of those formats must have its own ISBN. In other words, each of the three separate EPUB , Amazon Kindle , and PDF formats of a particular book will have its own specific ISBN. They should not share the ISBN of the paper version, and there is no generic "eISBN" which encompasses all the e-book formats for a title. [41]

EAN format used in barcodes, and upgrading
Currently the barcodes on a book's back cover (or inside a mass-market paperback book's front cover) are EAN-13 ; they may have a separate barcode encoding five digits for the currency and the recommended retail price . [42] For 10 digit ISBNs, the number "978", the Bookland "country code", is prefixed to the ISBN in the barcode data, and the check digit is recalculated according to the EAN13 formula (modulo 10, 1x and 3x weighting on alternate digits).
Partly because of an expected shortage in certain ISBN categories, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) decided to migrate to a thirteen-digit ISBN (ISBN-13). The process began 1 January 2005 and was planned to conclude 1 January 2007. [43] As of 2011, all the 13-digit ISBNs began with 978. As the 978 ISBN supply is exhausted, the 979 prefix was introduced. Part of the 979 prefix is reserved for use with the Musicland code for musical scores with an ISMN . 10 digit ISMN codes differed visually as they began with an "M" letter; the bar code represents the "M" as a zero (0), and for checksum purposes it counted as a 3. All ISMNs are now 13 digits commencing 979-0; 979-1 to 979-9 will be used by ISBN.
Publisher identification code numbers are unlikely to be the same in the 978 and 979 ISBNs, likewise, there is no guarantee that language area code numbers will be the same. Moreover, the ten-digit ISBN check digit generally is not the same as the thirteen-digit ISBN check digit. Because the GTIN-13 is part of the Global Trade Item Number (GTIN) system (that includes the GTIN-14, the GTIN-12, and the GTIN-8), the 13-digit ISBN falls within the 14-digit data field range. [44]
Barcode format compatibility is maintained, because (aside from the group breaks) the ISBN-13 barcode format is identical to the EAN barcode format of existing 10-digit ISBNs. So, migration to an EAN-based system allows booksellers the use of a single numbering system for both books and non-book products that is compatible with existing ISBN based data, with only minimal changes to information technology systems. Hence, many booksellers (e.g., Barnes & Noble ) migrated to EAN barcodes as early as March 2005. Although many American and Canadian booksellers were able to read EAN-13 barcodes before 2005, most general retailers could not read them. The upgrading of the UPC barcode system to full EAN-13, in 2005, eased migration to the ISBN-13 in North America.

Bloomberg Businessweek
Bloomberg Businessweek is an American weekly business magazine published by Bloomberg L.P. Businessweek was founded in 1929, the magazine was created to provide information and interpretation about what was happening in the business world. [2] It is headquartered in New York City . Megan Murphy was appointed editor of the magazine in November 2016. [3]

History
Businessweek was first published in September 1929, weeks before the stock market crash of 1929 . The magazine provided information and opinions on what was happening in the business world at the time. Early sections of the magazine included marketing, labor, finance, management and Washington Outlook, which made Businessweek one of the first publications to cover national political issues that directly impacted the business world. [4]
Businessweek was originally published to be a resource for business managers. However, in the 1970s, the magazine shifted its strategy and added consumers outside of the business world. [5] Since 1975, Businessweek has carried more annual advertising pages than any other magazine in the United States. [6]
Stephen B. Shepard served as editor-in-chief from 1984 until 2005 when he was chosen to be the founding dean of the CUNY Graduate School of Journalism . Under Shepard, Businessweek ' s readership grew to more than six million in the late 1980s. [7] He was succeeded by Stephen J. Adler of The Wall Street Journal . [8]

Bloomberg L.P. acquisition
Businessweek suffered a decline during the late-2000s recession as advertising revenues fell one-third by the start of 2009 and the magazine's circulation fell to 936,000. In July 2009, it was reported that McGraw-Hill was trying to sell Businessweek and had hired Evercore Partners to conduct the sale. Because of the magazine's liabilities, it was suggested that it might change hands for the nominal price of $1 to an investor who was willing to incur losses turning the magazine around. [9]
In late 2009, Bloomberg L.P. bought the magazine—for a reported price between $2 million to $5 million plus assumption of liabilities—and renamed it Bloomberg BusinessWeek . [10] [11] It is now believed McGraw-Hill received the high end of the speculated price, at $5 million, along with the assumption of debt. Currently, the magazine still loses $30 million per year, about half of the $60 million it was reported losing in 2009. [12] Adler resigned as editor-in-chief and was replaced by Josh Tyrangiel , who had been deputy managing editor of Time magazine. [13] In early 2010, the magazine title was restyled Bloomberg Businessweek (with a lowercase "w") as part of a redesign. [14]

Recent history
Megan Murphy is the third editor of the magazine in the eight years of Bloomberg ownership. The magazine is reportedly losing between $20-$30 million a year. [3] The magazine is to undergo substantial changes in the second quarter of 2017.

Business school rankings
Since 1988, Businessweek has published annual rankings of United States business school MBA programs. [15] In 2006, it also started publishing annual rankings of undergraduate business programs. [16]

Additional versions
International editions of Businessweek were available on newsstands in Europe and Asia until 2005 when publication of regional editions was suspended to help increase foreign readership of customized European and Asian versions of Businessweek's website. [17] However, the same year the Russian edition was launched in collaboration with Rodionov Publishing House. [18]
At the same time, Businessweek partnered with InfoPro Management, a publishing and market research company based in Beirut, Lebanon , to produce the Arabic version of the magazine in 22 Arab countries. [19]
In 2011, Bloomberg Businessweek continued the magazine's international expansion and announced plans to introduce a Polish-language edition called Bloomberg Businessweek Polska , as well as a Chinese edition which was relaunched in November 2011. [20] [21] [22]
Bloomberg Businessweek launched an iPad version of the magazine using Apple's subscription billing service in 2011. [23] [24] The iPad edition was the first to use this subscription method, which allows one to subscribe via an iTunes account. [25] There are over 100,000 subscribers to the iPad edition of Businessweek . [26]

Honors and awards
In 2011, Adweek named Bloomberg Businessweek as the top business magazine in the country. [27] In 2012, Bloomberg Businessweek won the general excellence award for general-interest magazines at the National Magazine Awards . [28] Also in 2012, Bloomberg Businessweek editor Josh Tyrangiel was named magazine editor of the year by Ad Age . [29] In 2014, Bloomberg Businessweek won a Society of American Business Editors and Writers Best in Business award for magazines, general excellence. [30]

Social Science Research Network
The Social Science Research Network ( SSRN ) is a website devoted to the rapid dissemination of scholarly research in the social sciences and humanities . In January 2013, SSRN was ranked the top open-access repository in the world by Ranking Web of Repositories (an initiative of the Cybermetrics Lab , a research group belonging to the Spanish National Research Council ). [1] In May 2016, SSRN was bought from Social Science Electronic Publishing Inc. by Elsevier . [2]

History
SSRN was founded in 1994 by Michael Jensen and Wayne Marr, both financial economists .
In May 2016, SSRN was bought from Social Science Electronic Publishing Inc. by Elsevier . [2]
In July 2016 there were reports of papers being removed from SSRN without notice; revision comments from SSRN indicated this was due to copyright concerns. [3] SSRN CEO Gregg Gordon characterized the issue as a mistake affecting about 20 papers. [4]

Operations
In economics, and to some degree in law (especially in the field of law and economics ), many papers are now first published as preprints on SSRN and/or other paper distribution networks such as Research Papers in Economics (RePEc) or bepress before being submitted to an academic journal .
SSRN, like other preprint services, circulates publications throughout the scholarly community at an early stage, permitting the author to incorporate comments into the final version of the paper before its publication in a journal. Moreover, even if access to the published paper is restricted, access to the original working paper remains open through SSRN, so long as the author decides to keep the paper up. Often authors take papers down at the request of publishers, particularly if they are published by commercial or university presses which depend on payment for paper copies or on-line access.
Academic papers in PDF format can be uploaded directly to the SSRN site by authors and are then available for worldwide free downloading. Publishers and institutions can upload papers and charge a fee for readers to download them. [5] Users can also subscribe to abstracting email journals covering a broad range of subject matters. These e-journals then periodically distribute emails containing abstracts (with links to the full text where applicable) of papers recently submitted to SSRN in the respective field.
On SSRN, authors and papers are ranked by their number of downloads, which has become an informal indicator of popularity on prepress and open access sites. [6]
SSRN has mirror sites at the European Corporate Governance Institute (London), Korea University (Seoul), Stanford Law School (California) and University of Chicago Booth School of Business (Illinois). [5]

Kuro5hin
Kuro5hin ( K5 ) ( / k ə ˈ r oʊ ʒ ən / [8] [9] corrosion [10] ) was a collaborative discussion website founded by Rusty Foster in 1999. [11] Articles were created and submitted by users and submitted to a queue for evaluation. Site members could vote for or against publishing an article and once the article had reached a certain number of votes, it was published to the site or deleted from the queue. [12] The site has been described as "a free-for-all of news and opinion written by readers". [13]
The site was founded by Rusty Foster in December 1999, having been inspired by Slashdot . [10] Kuro5hin's membership once numbered in the tens of thousands, [12] but its popularity declined significantly from its peak in the early 2000s. [14]
On May 1, 2016, the site was closed down permanently with all content taken offline. [15] However, according to Foster, it may return in the form of an archive of static content at a later date. [16]

Overview
All content was generated and selected by the users themselves, with the exception of site news written by the administrators. Registered users would submit stories to the submissions queue where other users would vote +1 FP ( front page ), +1, 0, or -1. If the story reached a predetermined threshold score, it was posted to the front page or to the relevant section, depending on the proportion of "FP votes". If it failed to make the threshold, other factors (such as number of comments, type of comments, and their ratings) could still cause the story to be posted to a section or to the front page. Otherwise, it was dropped. [17] [18] [19]
One feature of the story queue was edit mode , in which a story was protected from voting for a period of time during which the author could make changes. Comments could still be made on the story to suggest changes before voting began. These comments were distinguished as being editorial or topical .
A further section was known as the diaries . Having no editing or moderation vetting, diaries were essentially weblogs . [20] and formed the source of most of Kuro5hin's content by volume. However, unlike the edited article sections, they were not widely syndicated. Other users would also comment on these diaries in the same way as stories but with without the editorial or topical stipulation.

History
Rusty Foster named Kuro5hin — pronounced corrosion — as a pun on his first name. [10] The site was powered by the Scoop collaborative system, originally written by Rusty himself, [21] with the motto "Technology and Culture, from the Trenches".

Outages
In July 2000, the site was temporarily closed due to comment spam and denial of service attacks. [22]

Financial difficulties
In January 2002, OSDN ended the advertising affiliate agreement with Kuro5hin. [23] In June of that year, Foster suggested he might be forced to sell or shut down the site due to lack of funds. He solicited donations to support the site, and some users were critical of a perceived lack of active management and functional improvement. [ citation needed ]

Subscription
On March 25, 2004, Foster closed off new user accounts because a photoshopped pornographic image of his wife had been posted. [24] On July 13, Foster reopened new user accounts and informed the community that he was abandoning the idea of user sponsorship. [25] [ non-primary source needed ] This user sponsorship initiative never came to pass.

Harvard Law School
Harvard Law School (also known as Harvard Law or HLS ) is one of the professional graduate schools of Harvard University , located in Cambridge , Massachusetts . Founded in 1817, it is the oldest continually-operating law school in the United States and is generally considered to be one of the most prestigious in the world. [2] [3] The school is ranked third by the U.S. News & World and Report . Its acceptance rate was 15.4% in the 2013–14 admissions cycle, and its yield rate of 66.2% was the second-highest of any law school in the United States . [4] [5] It is ranked first in the 2016 QS World University Rankings . [6] Harvard Law admitted 16.5% of applicants in its most recent class, [7] compared to 9.2% at Yale [8] and 11.2% at Stanford . [9]
The school has a considerably larger class size than most law schools – each class in the three-year J.D. program has approximately 560 students, the largest of the top 150 ranked law schools in the United States. [10] With a current enrollment of 1,990, [11] HLS has about as many students as its three closest-ranked peer institutions: first-ranked Yale, second-ranked Stanford, and fourth-ranked Chicago , combined. The first-year (1L) class is broken into seven sections of approximately 80 students, who take most first-year classes together. Harvard's uniquely large class size and its prestige have led the law school to graduate a great many distinguished alumni in the judiciary, government, and the business world.
According to Harvard Law's 2015 ABA -required disclosures, 95.33% of the Class of 2014 passed the Bar exam. [12] Harvard Law School graduates have accounted for 568 judicial clerkships in the past three years, [ when? ] including one-quarter of all Supreme Court clerkships , [13] more than any other law school in the United States.
Harvard Law School's founding is traditionally linked to the funding of Harvard's first professorship in law, paid for from a bequest from the estate of Isaac Royall, Jr. , a wealthy slaveholder. Today, it is home to the largest academic law library in the world. [14] [15] The current dean of Harvard Law School is Martha Minow , who assumed the role on July 1, 2009. The law school has 328 faculty members. [16]

Harvard Law School's founding is traced to the establishment of a "law department" at Harvard in 1817. [17] Dating the founding to the year of the creation of the law department makes Harvard Law the oldest continuously-operating law school in the nation. William & Mary Law School opened first in 1779, but closed due to the American Civil War , reopening in 1920. [18] The University of Maryland School of Law was chartered in 1816, but did not begin classes until 1824, and also closed during the Civil War. [19]
The founding of the law department came two years after the establishment of Harvard's first endowed professorship in law, funded by a bequest from the estate of wealthy slaveowner Isaac Royall, Jr. , in 1817. [20] Royall left roughly 1,000 acres of land in Massachusetts to Harvard when he died in exile in Nova Scotia, where he fled as a British loyalist during the American Revolution , in 1781, “to be appropriated towards the endowing a Professor of Laws . . . or a Professor of Physick and Anatomy, whichever the said overseers and Corporation [of the college] shall judge to be best.” [21] The value of the land, when fully liquidated in 1809, was $2,938; the Harvard Corporation allocated $400 from the income generated by those funds to create the Royall Professorship of Law in 1815. [21] The dean of the law school traditionally held the Royall chair, deans Elena Kagan and Martha Minow declined the Royall chair due to its origins in the proceeds of slavery.
Royall's Medford estate, the Isaac Royall House , is now a museum which features the only remaining slave quarters in the northeast United States.
The Royall family coat-of-arms , which shows three stacked wheat sheaves, was adopted as the school crest in 1936, topped with the university motto ( Veritas , Latin "truth"). [22] In March 2016, following requests by students, the school decided to remove the emblem because of its association with slavery. [23]

Growth and the Langdell curriculum
By 1827, the school, with one faculty member, was struggling. Nathan Dane , a prominent alumnus of the college, then endowed the Dane Professorship of Law, insisting that it be given to then Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story . For a while, the school was called "Dane Law School." [24] In 1829, John H. Ashmun, son of Eli Porter Ashmun and brother of George Ashmun , accepted a professorship and closed his Northampton Law School , with many of his students following him to Harvard. [25] Story's belief in the need for an elite law school based on merit and dedicated to public service helped build the school's reputation at the time, although the contours of these beliefs have not been consistent throughout its history. Enrollment remained low through the 19th century as university legal education was considered to be of little added benefit to apprenticeships in legal practice.
In the 1870s, under Dean Christopher Columbus Langdell , HLS introduced what has become the standard first-year curriculum for American law schools – including classes in contracts , property , torts , criminal law , and civil procedure . At Harvard, Langdell also developed the case method of teaching law, now the dominant pedagogical model at U.S. law schools. Langdell's notion that law could be studied as a "science" gave university legal education a reason for being distinct from vocational preparation. Critics at first defended the old lecture method because it was faster and cheaper and made fewer demands on faculty and students. Advocates said the case method had a sounder theoretical basis in scientific research and the inductive method. Langdell's graduates became leading professors at other law schools where they introduced the case method. The method was facilitated by casebooks. From its founding in 1900, the Association of American Law Schools promoted the case method in law schools that sought accreditation . [26] [27]

20th century: institutional criticism
Throughout most of the 20th century, HLS was often believed to be a competitive environment. For example, Dean Berring of University of California, Berkeley School of Law once stated that he "view[ed] Harvard Law School as a samurai ring where you can test your swordsmanship against the swordsmanship of the strongest intellectual warriors from around the nation." [28] When Langdell developed the original law school curriculum, Harvard University President Charles Eliot told him to make it "hard and long." [29] [30] The school's competitive culture gave rise to the urban legend of a dean at the school telling incoming students, "Look to your left, look to your right, because one of you won't be here by the end of the year." [31] Scott Turow 's memoir One L and John Jay Osborn 's novel The Paper Chase describe such an environment.
In addition, Eleanor Kerlow's book Poisoned Ivy: How Egos, Ideology, and Power Politics Almost Ruined Harvard Law School criticized the school for a 1980s political dispute between newer and older faculty members over accusations of insensitivity to minority and feminist issues. Divisiveness over such issues as political correctness lent the school the title "Beirut on the Charles." [32]
In Broken Contract: A Memoir of Harvard Law School, Richard Kahlenberg criticized the school for driving students away from public interest and toward work in high-paying law firms. Kahlenberg's criticisms are supported by Granfield and Koenig's study, which found that "students [are directed] toward service in the most prestigious law firms, both because they learn that such positions are their destiny and because the recruitment network that results from collective eminence makes these jobs extremely easy to obtain." [33] The school has also been criticized for its large first year class sizes (at one point there were 140 students per classroom; in 2001 there were 80), a cold and aloof administration, [34] and an inaccessible faculty. The latter stereotype is a central plot element of The Paper Chase and appears in Legally Blonde .
In response to the above criticisms, HLS eventually implemented the once-criticized [30] but now dominant approach pioneered by Dean Robert Hutchins at Yale Law School , of shifting the competitiveness to the admissions process while making law school itself a more cooperative experience. Robert Granfield and Thomas Koenig's 1992 study of Harvard Law students that appeared in The Sociological Quarterly found that students "learn to cooperate with rather than compete against classmates," and that contrary to "less eminent" law schools, students "learn that professional success is available for all who attend, and that therefore, only neurotic 'gunners' try to outdo peers." [33]

21st century
Under Kagan, the second half of the 2000s saw significant academic changes since the implementation of the Langdell curriculum. In 2006, the faculty voted unanimously to approve a new first-year curriculum, placing greater emphasis on problem-solving, administrative law, and international law. The new curriculum was implemented in stages over the next several years, [35] [36] with the last new course, a first year practice-oriented problem solving workshop, being instituted in January 2010. In late 2008, the faculty decided that the school should move to an Honors/Pass/Low Pass (H/P/LP) grading system, much like those in place at Yale and Stanford Law Schools. The system applied to half the courses taken by students in the Class of 2010 and fully started with the Class of 2011. [37]
In 2009, Kagan was appointed solicitor general of the United States by President Barack Obama and resigned the deanship. On June 11, 2009, Harvard University president, Drew Gilpin Faust named Martha Minow as the new dean. She assumed the position on July 1, 2009. On January 3, 2017, Minow announced that she would conclude her tenure as dean at the end of the academic year. [38]

Reputation
HLS is currently ranked third by the U.S. News & World and Report . Its acceptance rate was 15.4% in the 2013–14 admissions cycle, and its yield rate of 66.2% was the second-highest of any law school in the United States . [4] [5] It ranked first, with a perfect overall assessment score of 100.0, on the 2016 QS World University Rankings. [39]

Employment
More than 120 from the last five graduating classes have obtained tenure -track law teaching positions. [40] Adjusted for student body size, this puts Harvard in second place among U.S. law schools , about 2 percentage points ahead of Stanford and Chicago (which tied for third place) but behind Yale.
According to the Employment Summary for 2014 Graduates, 90% were employed in bar passage required jobs and another 4.4% were employed in J.D. advantage jobs. [41]

Costs
The total cost of attendance (indicating the cost of tuition, fees, and living expenses) at Harvard Law for the 2014–2015 academic year is $81,900. [43]

Shield retirement
In 2016, the governing body of the university, the Harvard Corporation , voted to retire the law school's 80 year old shield. The shield, depicting three wheat sheaves, was based in part upon the coat of arms of Isaac Royall Jr. , a university benefactor who had endowed the first professorship in the law school. The shield had become a source of contention among a group of law school students, who objected to the Royall family's history as slave-owners. [44] [45]
The president of the university and dean of the law school, acting upon the recommendation of a committee formed to study the issue, ultimately agreed with its majority decision, [46] that the shield was inconsistent with the values of both the university and the law school. Their recommendation was ultimately adopted by the Harvard Corporation and on March 15, 2016, the shield was ordered retired. [47] [48]

Student Organizations and Journals
Harvard Law School has more than 90 student organizations that are active on campus. [49] These organizations include the student-edited journals, Harvard Law Record , and the HLS Drama Society, which organizes the annual Harvard Law School Parody , as well as other political, social, service, and athletic groups.

Harvard Law Review
Students of the Juris Doctor (JD) program are involved in preparing and publishing the Harvard Law Review , one of the most highly cited university law reviews , as well as a number of other law journals and an independent student newspaper. The Harvard Law Review was first published in 1887 and has been staffed and edited by some of the school's most notable alumni. [50] In addition to the journal, the Harvard Law Review Association also publishes The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation , the most widely followed authority for legal citation formats in the United States. The student newspaper , the Harvard Law Record , has been published continuously since the 1940s, making it one of the oldest law school newspapers in the country, and has included the exploits of fictional law student Fenno for decades. The Harvard Law School Forum on Corporate Governance and Financial Regulation, formerly known as the Harvard Law School Corporate Governance Blog , is one of the most widely read law websites in the country.

JSTOR
JSTOR ( / ˈ dʒ eɪ s t ɔːr / JAY -stor ; [3] short for Journal Storage ) is a digital library founded in 1995. Originally containing digitized back issues of academic journals , it now also includes books and primary sources, and current issues of journals. [4] It provides full-text searches of almost 2,000 journals. [5] As of 2013, more than 8,000 institutions in more than 160 countries had access to JSTOR; [5] most access is by subscription, but some older public domain content is freely available to anyone. [6] JSTOR's revenue was $69 million in 2014. [7]

History
William G. Bowen , president of Princeton University from 1972 to 1988, founded JSTOR. [8] JSTOR originally was conceived as a solution to one of the problems faced by libraries, especially research and university libraries , due to the increasing number of academic journals in existence. Most libraries found it prohibitively expensive in terms of cost and space to maintain a comprehensive collection of journals. By digitizing many journal titles, JSTOR allowed libraries to outsource the storage of journals with the confidence that they would remain available long-term. Online access and full-text search ability improved access dramatically.
Bowen initially considered using CD-ROMs for distribution. [9] However, Ira Fuchs , Princeton University's vice-president for Computing and Information Technology, convinced Bowen that CD-ROM was an increasingly outdated technology and that network distribution could eliminate redundancy and increase accessibility. (For example, all Princeton's administrative and academic buildings were networked by 1989; the student dormitory network was completed in 1994; and campus networks like the one at Princeton were, in turn, linked to larger networks such as BITNET and the Internet .) JSTOR was initiated in 1995 at seven different library sites, and originally encompassed ten economics and history journals. JSTOR access improved based on feedback from its initial sites, and it became a fully searchable index accessible from any ordinary web browser . Special software was put in place [ where? ] to make pictures and graphs clear and readable. [10]
With the success of this limited project, Bowen and Kevin Guthrie, then-president of JSTOR, wanted to expand the number of participating journals. They met with representatives of the Royal Society of London and an agreement was made [ by whom? ] to digitize the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society dating from its beginning in 1665. The work of adding these volumes to JSTOR was completed by December 2000. [10]
The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation funded JSTOR initially. Until January 2009 JSTOR operated as an independent, self-sustaining nonprofit organization with offices in New York City and in Ann Arbor , Michigan . Then JSTOR merged with the nonprofit Ithaka Harbors, Inc. [11] - a nonprofit organization founded in 2003 and "dedicated to helping the academic community take full advantage of rapidly advancing information and networking technologies." [1]

Content
JSTOR content is provided by more than 900 publishers. [5] The database contains more than 1,900 journal titles, [5] in more than 50 disciplines. Each object is uniquely identified by an integer value, starting at 1 .
In addition to the main site, the JSTOR labs group operates an open service that allows access to the contents of the archives for the purposes of corpus analysis at its Data for Research service. [12] This site offers a search facility with graphical indication of the article coverage and loose integration into the main JSTOR site. Users may create focused sets of articles and then request a dataset containing word and n-gram frequencies and basic metadata. They are notified when the dataset is ready and may download it in either XML or CSV formats. The service does not offer full-text, although academics may request that from JSTOR, subject to a non-disclosure agreement.
JSTOR Plant Science [13] is available in addition to the main site. JSTOR Plant Science provides access to content such as plant type specimens, taxonomic structures, scientific literature, and related materials and aimed at those researching, teaching, or studying botany, biology, ecology, environmental, and conservation studies. The materials on JSTOR Plant Science are contributed through the Global Plants Initiative (GPI) [14] and are accessible only to JSTOR and GPI members. Two partner networks are contributing to this: the African Plants Initiative, which focuses on plants from Africa, and the Latin American Plants Initiative, which contributes plants from Latin America.
JSTOR launched its Books at JSTOR program in November 2012, adding 15,000 current and backlist books to its site. The books are linked with reviews and from citations in journal articles. [15]

Access
JSTOR is licensed mainly to academic institutions, public libraries, research institutions, museums, and schools. More than 7,000 institutions in more than 150 countries have access. [4] JSTOR has been running a pilot program of allowing subscribing institutions to provide access to their alumni, in addition to current students and staff. The Alumni Access Program officially launched in January 2013. [16] Individual subscriptions also are available to certain journal titles through the journal publisher. [17] Every year, JSTOR blocks 150 million attempts by non-subscribers to read articles. [18]
Inquiries have been made about the possibility of making JSTOR open access . According to Harvard Law professor Lawrence Lessig , JSTOR had been asked "how much would it cost to make this available to the whole world, how much would we need to pay you? The answer was $250 million". [19]

Aaron Swartz incident
In late 2010 and early 2011, Internet activist Aaron Swartz used MIT 's data network to bulk-download a substantial portion of JSTOR's collection of academic journal articles. [20] [21] When the bulk-download was discovered, a video camera was placed in the room to film the mysterious visitor and the relevant computer was left untouched. Once video was captured of the visitor, the download was stopped and Swartz identified. Rather than pursue a civil lawsuit against him, in June 2011 they reached a settlement wherein he surrendered the downloaded data. [20] [21]
The following month, federal authorities charged Swartz with several " data theft "-related crimes, including wire fraud , computer fraud, unlawfully obtaining information from a protected computer , and recklessly damaging a protected computer. [22] [23] Prosecutors in the case claimed that Swartz acted with the intention of making the papers available on P2P file-sharing sites . [21] [24]
Swartz surrendered to authorities, pleaded not guilty to all counts, and was released on $100,000 bail. In September 2012, U.S. attorneys increased the number of charges against Swartz from four to thirteen, with a possible penalty of 35 years in prison and $1 million in fines. [25] [26] The case still was pending when Swartz committed suicide in January 2013. [27] Prosecutors dropped the charges after his death. [28]

Limitations
The availability of most journals on JSTOR is controlled by a " moving wall ," which is an agreed-upon delay between the current volume of the journal and the latest volume available on JSTOR. This time period is specified by agreement between JSTOR and the publisher of the journal, which usually is three to five years. Publishers may request that the period of a "moving wall" be changed or request discontinuation of coverage. Formerly, publishers also could request that the "moving wall" be changed to a "fixed wall"—a specified date after which JSTOR would not add new volumes to its database. As of November 2010 [update] , "fixed wall" agreements were still in effect with three publishers of 29 journals made available online through sites controlled by the publishers. [29]
In 2010, JSTOR started adding current issues of certain journals through its Current Scholarship Program. [30]

Increasing public access
Beginning September 6, 2011, JSTOR made public domain content freely available to the public. [31] [32] This "Early Journal Content" program constitutes about 6% of JSTOR's total content, and includes over 500,000 documents from more than 200 journals that were published before 1923 in the United States, and before 1870 in other countries. [31] [32] [33] JSTOR stated that it had been working on making this material free for some time. The Swartz controversy and Greg Maxwell's protest torrent of the same content led JSTOR to "press ahead" with the initiative. [31] [32] As of 2017, JSTOR does not have plans to extend it to other public domain content, stating that "We do not believe that just because something is in the public domain, it can always be provided for free". [34]
In January 2012, JSTOR started a pilot program, "Register & Read," offering limited no-cost access (not open access ) to archived articles for individuals who register for the service. At the conclusion of the pilot, in January 2013, JSTOR expanded Register & Read from an initial 76 publishers to include about 1,200 journals from over 700 publishers. [35] Registered readers may read up to three articles online every two weeks, but may not print or download PDFs. [36]
This is done by placing up to 3 items on a "shelf". The "Shelf" is under "My JSTOR" below "My Profile". The 3 works can then be read online at any time. An item cannot be removed from the shelf until it has been there for 14 days. Removing an old work from the shelf creates space for a new one, but doing so means the old work can no longer be accessed until it is shelved again.
JSTOR is conducting a pilot program with Wikipedia , whereby established editors are given reading privileges through the Wikipedia Library, as with a university library. [37] [38]

Use
In 2012, JSTOR users performed nearly 152 million searches, with more than 113 million article views and 73.5 million article downloads. [5] JSTOR has been used as a resource for linguistics research to investigate trends in language use over time and also to analyze gender differences in scholarly publishing. [39] [40]

Maastricht University
Maastricht University (abbreviated as UM ; [4] Dutch : Universiteit Maastricht [5] ) is a public university in Maastricht , the Netherlands . Founded in 1976, the university is the second youngest of the 13 Dutch universities.
In 2013, nearly 16,000 students studied at Maastricht University, 47% of whom were foreign students, with over 3,200 employees. [3] About half of the bachelor 's programmes are fully offered in English , while the other half is taught wholly or partly in Dutch . Most of the master 's and doctoral programmes are in English. In 2013, Maastricht University was the second Dutch university to be rewarded the ‘Distinctive Quality Feature for Internationalisation’ by the Accreditation Organisation of the Netherlands and Flanders (NVAO).
Besides traditional programmes, Maastricht University also has an honours liberal arts college: University College Maastricht and a Maastricht Science Programme in the same liberal arts tradition. The satellite University College Venlo opened in 2015.

History
Maastricht University was officially established in 1976. Faced with a shortage of medical professionals, the Dutch government decided in the late 1960s that a new public institution of higher education was needed in order to expand the country's medical training facilities. Political leaders in the province of Limburg , most notably Sjeng Tans, the chairman of the Labour Party and former member of the Limburg provincial council and Maastricht city council, successfully lobbied for the new medical school to be established in Maastricht. This academic institution would be vital to sustain the intellectual life of the city, and indeed the whole province. Moreover, it was argued that the establishment of a university in Maastricht could contribute to the government's restructuring efforts in this part of the Netherlands, which was experiencing economic challenges following the collapse of the Limburg coal mining industry . [6]
The newly established school chose not to await official recognition but to start its educational programme in September 1974, adopting an innovative approach to academic education in the form of problem-based learning . About 50 students enrolled in the first academic year. By the end of 1975, the Dutch Parliament eventually passed the statute needed for the institution to acquire national educational funds and to be able to award academic degrees. [7] The new university, named Rijksuniversiteit Limburg (State University of Limburg), was officially established on the 9th of January 1976, when Queen Juliana of the Netherlands signed the university’s founding charter at a ceremony in the Basilica of Saint Servatius . Sjeng Tans became the university's first president.
Soon after its establishment, the university gained political support to increase its funding and to expand into other academic fields. The Faculty of Law was created in 1981, followed by the Faculty of Economics in 1984. In 1994, the Faculty of Arts and Culture and one year later the Faculty of Psychology were established. The Faculty of Humanities and Sciences started in 2005, containing a variety of organisational units, such as the Department of Knowledge Engineering and the Maastricht Graduate School of Governance. Together with the Faculty of Health, Medicine and Life Sciences (established in 2007 as a merger between the Faculty of Health Sciences and the Faculty of Medicine) Maastricht University currently has six faculties.
The university was renamed Universiteit Maastricht in 1996 and added its English-language name in 2008. As of 2010, Maastricht University consists of six faculties offering 17 bachelor programmes, 56 master programmes and several Ph.D. programmes.

Organisation

Governance
At the central level, the university is governed by the Executive Board, consisting of a President, a Vice-President and a Rector. The Executive Board appoints faculty deans, other administrators and professors and has general management responsibilities. [8] It is advised by the Supervisory Council that vets for instance the budget. The University Council, an elected body representing all members of staff and students at the university, has a limited number of decision-making powers as well as general advising responsibilities regarding the university’s teaching and research programmes and in organisational and budgetary matters.
Maastricht University's teaching and research programmes are primarily carried out along the lines of faculties . [9] Within faculties, teaching and research activities may be further decentralised through departments, schools, institutes or colleges. The names of organisational (sub)units, however, do not necessarily indicate their position within the university’s organisational hierarchy. In 2009, for example, the Faculty of Economics and Business Administration was renamed School of Business and Economics, even though it maintains the rank of a faculty. [10]
The Board of Deans, consisting of all faculty deans and the Rector, acts as a coordinating and consulting body at the central level and is responsible for awarding doctoral degrees and honorary doctorates. [11]

Faculties

Faculty of Health, Medicine and Life Sciences
The Faculty of Health, Medicine and Life Sciences (FHML) was established in 2007 as a merger between the Faculty of Health Sciences and the Faculty of Medicine. The latter was the first faculty to be established at Maastricht University. In 1980 the Faculty of Health Sciences was founded. The broad range of disciplines it offered in healthcare sciences , made the faculty unique, not only in the Netherlands, but also in Europe. The format allowed students to integrate their discipline and research work into all areas related to society, health and disease. A one-year master's program in global health is available.
The two united faculties have developed into a community of approximately 1950 students, with a staff of around 1200 (academics, administrative and support staff). Since 1992 staff and students are based in the Randwyck district, near the University Hospital ( Academisch Ziekenhuis Maastricht or AZM) which opened in 1991.

Faculty of Psychology and Neuroscience
Founded in 1995, the Faculty of Psychology and Neuroscience (FPN) is specialised in two contemporary approaches in psychology: cognitive psychology and biological psychology . It is home to around 1,500 students and 250 staff. [12] The faculty offers a Dutch and English bachelor's programme in psychology, two English-taught master's programmes and one research master's programme. The one-year master´s programme in psychology offers specialisations in neuropsychology , developmental psychology , cognitive neuroscience , health and social psychology, psychology and law, work and organisational psychology . In conjunction with the Faculty of Health, Medicine and Life Sciences, the two-year research master Cognitive and Clinical Neuroscience offers four different specialisations: cognitive neuroscience, fundamental neuroscience, neuropsychology and psychopathology . The selective two-year master programme Forensic Psychology in English, offers theoretical, research and skills courses, to educate students to become scientist-practitioners in the field of forensic psychology and psychiatry. The faculty's unique research infrastructure – including hypermodern high field MRI scanners – allows for groundbreaking research into the brain and behaviour.

School of Business and Economics
The School of Business and Economics (SBE) was founded in 1984. It is currently the biggest faculty within UM in terms of student numbers. Of the 4,200 students enrolled, more than 60% come from abroad. [13] As a business school, SBE is accredited by EQUIS , AACSB and the Association of MBAs . According to the school's website, this Triple Crown accreditation has only been achieved by 1% of business schools worldwide. [14] SBE offers bachelor's programmes (B.Sc.) in International Business, Economics and Business Economics, Fiscal Economics, and Econometrics and Operations, as well as a number of master's programmes, executive master's programmes and MBA 's. SBE students are represented by SCOPE Maastricht , the School's general student association.

Faculty of Law
Maastricht University’s Faculty of Law (FL) was founded in 1981. [15] It started with a programme in Dutch law , designed in line with UM’s problem-based learning principles. Ninety students enrolled in the first year. In the 1990s, the faculty introduced a new programme entitled the European Law School (ELS), which focused on European, comparative and international law. The programme was taught partly in English. A fully English-language ELS programme was established in 2007. It was the first English-language bachelor’s programme in law in the Netherlands. [15] The faculty currently consists of about 2,500 students and 150 members of staff. It offers four bachelor’s ( LL.B. ) programmes: Dutch law, tax law, the Dutch-language ELS and the English-language ELS. In addition, the faculty offers seven master’s ( LL.M. ) programmes and three advanced master’s programmes, most of which are taught in English.
In research, the faculty has built a reputation in the areas of international, European and comparative law. [16] The faculty participates in two national research schools, the School of Human Rights and the Ius Commune Research School, and is home to several research institutes: the Institute for Transnational Legal Research (METRO), the Maastricht Centre for Human Rights, the Institute for Globalisation and International Regulation (IGIR), the Montesquieu Institute Maastricht, the Institute for Corporate Law, Governance and Innovation Policies (ICGI), and the Maastricht European Private Law Institute (M-EPLI).
The faculty was initially located at the Nieuwenhof béguinage, currently home to University College Maastricht. With the number of students growing quickly, the faculty moved to its current location in 1990. This building, the former seat of the provincial government of Limburg , consists of tutorial rooms, lecture halls as well as staff offices. The building underwent major renovation works around 2009, which included a new common room and lunch counter for students, a garden terrace, and an additional lecture hall in the former ballroom.

Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences
The Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, also known as FASoS, was founded in 1994. Currently FASoS hosts approximately 2000 students and around 240 staff members. Over 70% of the students are non-Dutch. Research and education is internationally oriented and all of the programmes are offered in English. The faculty is located in the centre of Maastricht, in four buildings on the Grote Gracht. [17]
The Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences offers two three-year bachelors programmes: Cultuurwetenschappen/Arts and Culture; and European Studies, and eight one-year masters programmes: European Studies; Globalisation and Development Studies; European Public Affairs; European Studies on Society, Science and Technology; Arts and Heritage; Policy, Management and Culture; Media Culture; Art, Literature and Society; and Politics and Society. Furthermore, two two-year research masters are offered: Cultures of Arts, Science and Technology; and European Studies. [18]
The Research Institute for Arts and Social Sciences encompasses all research of the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences. The Research Institute comprises four programmes: 1. Politics and Culture in Europe, 2. Science, Technology and Society, 3. Cultural Memory and Diversity and 4. Globalisation, Transnationalism and Development. The research area overlaps both the humanities and the social sciences. The faculty has a graduate school with an intake of about 10 PhD candidates each year. [19]

Faculty of Humanities and Sciences
The Faculty of Humanities and Sciences (FHS) consists of:

Tuition and Financial Assistance
Tuition fees at Maastricht University vary, depending on nationality and study programme. Regular tuition fees for public universities in the Netherlands are determined annually by law. Statutory tuition fees currently amount to €1,835 annually for both bachelor's and master's programmes. [20] Under European regulations, regular tuition levels are also applicable to foreign students from the European Economic Area , which includes all European Union member states. All other students pay institutional tuition fees, ranging from €8,500 to €9,500 annually for bachelor's programmes and €13,000 or more annually for master's programmes. Institutional fees will be raised incrementally over the next few years. [21] Since 2012, students at the University College pay a surcharge on top of the statutory or institutional tuition fees [20] to fund additional facilities, a student grants programme and student organisations at the college. [22] An earlier plan to introduce a separate institutional fee at the University College was shelved after criticism from staff and students. [23]
Ph.D. candidates ('promovendi') at Maastricht University do not pay tuition as they have the rank of junior members of the academic staff. [24] Ph.D. candidates are employed by the university or faculty on full-time, four-year contracts with regular, entry-level wages and employee benefits. Ph.D. appointments usually involve teaching responsibilities and limited administrative duties.
The Limburg University Fund, a fundraising foundation associated with the UM, administers a scholarship fund for students from emerging markets. A special fund was created to support students from Southeast Asian countries hit by the 2004 tsunami. [25]

Academic Life

Staff
Maastricht University's academic staff consists of about 1,900 members with a male/female ratio of 54/46. The number of support staff members amounts to 1,600, of which about 62% is female. [26] Nearly 20% of UM's staff members hold a foreign nationality. [26] About 12% of professors at Maastricht University are women. Regarding the number of female professors, the university ranks lower than comparable universities in the Netherlands even though the number has been on the increase over the past years. [27]

Teaching
Maastricht University awards degrees at all levels up to the title of doctor .
Teaching at Maastricht University is founded on the educational principles of problem-based learning (PBL). According to its website, UM is the only university which applies the problem-based learning approach in all its educational programmes. [28] In 1974, Maastricht's newly established Faculty of Medicine was only the second in the world to adopt the problem-based learning method. As PBL was originally designed for medical education, other faculties have developed a PBL approach that corresponds with the needs of their academic disciplines.
At the heart of Maastricht's PBL philosophy is the idea that students are personally responsible for their own academic education. [28] A typical UM course revolves around so-called 'tutorial groups'. [29] A tutorial group usually consists of 14 to 16 students, meeting once or twice a week to discuss self-identified problems on the basis of cases or situations described in the course manual. Each tutorial meeting consists of two parts: a post-discussion, where problems which have been identified at the previous session are discussed on the basis of assigned literature and sometimes with additional library research, followed by a pre-discussion of topics to be discussed at the next meeting. The tutorial group is chaired by a student member, who is expected to structure the discussion and ensure that every member of the group is able to participate. The instructor, typically named 'tutor', [30] plays only a limited role during tutorials. Tutors will monitor discussions, provide feedback, and, where needed, help students in identifying relevant problems. Courses usually take seven weeks of tutorials followed by a final exam, but may also include writing or speaking assignments.
Even though traditional lecture-based teaching is at odds with the primarily self-guiding PBL approach, it has become customary in many programmes at Maastricht to include at least some lectures in courses to supplement the tutorial-based structure. Also, electronic learning methods are increasingly being used. As PBL courses are intensive, students can take only two or three courses at a time depending on the number of credit hours per course. The university's Language Centre offers an introduction to Maastricht's PBL approach for international students. [31]

Rankings and reputation
According to Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2015/16 , Maastricht University occupied 88th position in the world rank. The university's medical and health care faculties reached 45th place worldwide in 2014. [35] QS World University Rankings 2014 ranked Maastricht University as the 118th best university in the world (3 up from the previous year), while Academic Ranking of World Universities (or Shanghai Ranking ) counted Maastricht among the world's top 300 universities, since 2011.
In the QS Top 50 Under 50 , which ranks the top 50 universities under 50 years old around the world, Maastricht University reached 6th place in 2014. [36] In a similar list published by Times Higher Education ( THE 100 Under 50 universities 2016 ), Maastricht University was placed 4th in the world. [37]

Notable Professors
In addition to these, four Distinguished University Professors have been appointed since 2014, mainly working in research:

Research
Research at Maastricht University concentrates on three major themes: Quality of Life, Learning and Innovation and Europe and a Globalising World.Examples of issues addressed through UM research are: healthy ageing, climate change, demographic changes, sustainability, the impact of technological developments, population ageing, healthy and affordable food, and the European integration process. A lot of this research is conducted in multidisciplinary teams and in institutes such as CARIM, the School for Cardiovascular Diseases.
A noted research platform is Brains Unlimited: a scanning lab at the Maastricht Health Campus, offering three MRI scanners with ultrahigh magnetic fields, including one of only four 9.4 Tesla scanners worldwide. Professor Rainer Goebel, director of the affiliated Maastricht Brain Imaging Centre (M-Bic), has been rewarded several large international research grants. The internationally renowned Tissue Regeneration group of Professor Clemens van Blitterswijk announced its coming to Maastricht University in February 2014. His coming fits in the large investment programme Kennis-As Limburg, that aims to strengthen the provincial knowledge economy. So does the Institute of Nanoscopy, led by Professor Peter Peters.
In 2011 the number of dissertations at the University of Maastricht reached 213; the number of scientific publications 3,567. [40] Most PhD programmes take place in faculty research units (so-called graduate schools ) or associated institutes. [41]

UM research and graduate schools

Independent research institutes, connected to UM

Knowledge transfer, entrepreneurship
As elsewhere, ongoing research at Maastricht University is translated into practice, leading to new products to be launched on the market. UM cooperates with businesses and socially relevant organisations through various programmes and institutes, like Maastricht Centre for Entrepreneurship , Service Science Factory , BioMedbooster , BioPartner Center Maastricht , Contract Research Centre and SME Portal Maastricht University . UM Holding is the corporate venture firm of UM spin-off companies and participations.
Brainport 2020 is the name of a programme that aims at campus development in four locations in the province of Limburg, in cooperation with the local government, business sector and knowledge institutions in the region:

Campuses
Maastricht University is located in buildings in two separate locations in Maastricht. The arts, humanities and social science departments are housed in a number of historic buildings in the city center, while psychology, the medical and life sciences are based in the modern Randwyck campus on the outskirts of the city.

City Centre Campus
The university’s arts, humanities and social sciences faculties are located in Maastricht’s city centre, west of the river Meuse. Most of the university’s inner city properties have official monumental status. As many of these buildings were facing abandonment at the time of their acquirement, the development of an urban university campus has contributed to the preservation and liveliness of Maastricht’s historic city centre. [42]

University buildings in Jekerkwartier
The first building that was obtained by the university was the former Jesuit monastery and seminary at Tongersestraat, largely dating from the 1930s. Here, in 1974 the newly established medical school started. After the Faculty of Medicine moved to premises closer to the newly constructed university hospital, the Jesuit monastery became home to the Faculty of Economy, which is now the university's largest academic unit in terms of student numbers. The building was expanded in the 1990s to include the university restaurant ( mensa in Dutch) and a large lecture hall designed by Dutch architect Jo Coenen .
The Faculty of Law is housed in the building known as Oud Gouvernement in Bouillonstraat, which was completed in 1935 as the provincial government building. It was acquired by the UM in 1986 after the provincial government had moved to its new premises on the river Meuse in the southeastern part of the city. Opposite lies Slijpe Court , a 17th-century mansion that in 2002 was refurbished to house the Department of Knowledge Engineering of the Faculty of Humanities and Science.
The university's administrative headquarters is located at Minderbroedersberg , in a former Franciscan monastery, which dates back to 1699 and was later used as a court house and prison. The UM acquired the building in order to make it their administrative center in 1999. The Minderbroedersberg, with its Aula (main hall), also serves as the university's primary location for official academic ceremonies, such as Ph.D. conferrals.
At the bottom of the hill lies the former convent of the Bonnefanten , now the university’s Student Service Center, as well as a visitor center, including a gift shop. This building, which dates back to 1627, served as a convent for nuns originally from Liège who were referred to as " bons enfants ", "good children". In the twentieth century, the city's art museum was established here and later took its name from the building, Bonnefantenmuseum . In 1979 the building became the main branch of the university library, until the library moved to its current location. The oldest part of the library building at Grote Looiersstraat was constructed in 1755 and served as the city’s poor house and military hospital. In the 1970s, the city’s public library was built in the garden. In 1999 the city library moved to its current location at Centre Ceramique. The old library was then acquired by the UM. After major renovation and expansion works, the university library relocated here in 2003.
University College Maastricht is located at Zwingelput in a 15th-century béguinage , named Nieuwenhof . Maastricht Science College has its new home since 2012 in the renovated Hustinx Mansion in Kapoenstraat, which has a richly ornamented façade and a courtyard that is now covered.

University buildings elsewhere in the city centre
Several other university institutions are housed in buildings elsewhere in the city centre. In Abtstraat, close to Jekerkwartier, UM owns two buildings that are used both by the faculties of law and economics. The UM Language Centre is based in an old canon's house at Sint Servaasklooster. The Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences currently occupies three adjacent buildings on Grote Gracht. Soiron Mansion , built by the architect Matthias Soiron for his two brothers, canons of Saint Servatius Church , the former Ursuline school buildings and Tilly Court , built for the military governor of Maastricht, both date from the 18th century.

Randwyck Campus
The Randwyck campus was developed from the 1970s onwards and has become the center for the university's psychology, health, medicine and life science activities. Here, plans for the Maastricht Health Campus are aimed at strengthening the scientific and economic impact of Randwyck.
The focal point for the Randwyck campus is the academic hospital (azM), which moved here from its original location on the West bank of the Meuse river in 1992. Some of university buildings are physically connected to the hospital, built in the 1990s. The university and the AZM work together in the Maastricht University Medical Center+, established in 2008.
In 2008, local housing association Servatius started construction of the ambitious campus project 'Campus Maastricht', to be built at a site near the university hospital. The costly project, designed by Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava , would provide for an athletic centre, student housing, guesthouses, retail facilities and office space. The project was canceled by Servatius because the costs were unrealistic.

Satellite Campuses
In recent years, the university has opened offices in the northern Limburg city of Venlo , the Belgian capital of Brussels and the city of Bangalore, India .
The Maastricht University, Campus Venlo is located in a 1930s building at Deken van Oppensingel, close to the center of Venlo . Maastricht University currently offers two Master's programmes at this campus ( Global Supply Chain Management , and Health Food Innovation Management ). Courses at University College Venlo started in September 2015. [43]

Student Life
In 2013, nearly 16,000 students studied at Maastricht University, 47% of whom were foreign. Students in Maastricht can affiliate with a number of student associations, international associations or debating societies. They present themselves during the annual INKOM, the general introduction week for new Maastricht students. Furthermore, Maastricht offers several cultural and sports activities in and around the city.

Student housing
Like most other Dutch universities, UM itself does not provide regular student housing. However, the university participates in a student housing foundation, offering mediation services to students. About 2,700 rooms and apartments offered through the Maastricht student housing foundation are provided by local housing associations Woonpunt, Servatius and Maasvallei. Some 8,000 other accommodations are provided by private landlords. [44] Most units are located in houses or small apartment complexes across the historic city centre or in its immediate surrounding neighbourhoods. Many foreign exchange students live at the UM Guesthouse in Annadal, which provides short-term housing.

Student Service Centre
UM's Student Service Centre is located in the former Bonnefanten monastery and offers financial, legal and other forms of advise to students. Part of the Student Service Centre is the Studium Generale cultural programma, offering lectures on a broad range of topics and other cultural activities to members of the university community and the general public. [45]

Observant and BreakingMaas
The university's independent newspaper, Observant , is published on a weekly basis and distributed throughout the university. It provides news, background articles, columns and educational information in Dutch and English, directed primarily at the university community. [46]
Since 2012 a television programme named BreakingMaas provides news and entertainment for students in English. The programme is available on the local TV broadcaster RTV Maastricht as well as on YouTube and Facebook .

San Antonio Express-News
The San Antonio Express-News is a daily newspaper of San Antonio , Texas . It is ranked as the fourth-largest daily newspaper in the state of Texas in terms of circulation (third-largest for Sunday circulation), and is one of the leading news sources of South Texas , with offices in Austin , Brownsville , Laredo , and Mexico City . The Express-News is owned by the Hearst Corporation .

History
The paper was first published in 1865 as a weekly tabloid-style newspaper under the name San Antonio Express . At that time, the city had already had a number of other newspapers in a number of different languages. However, all the other publications went out of business, leaving only the Express to serve the city.
In December 1866, the Express made the move from a weekly paper to a daily newspaper, and expanded into a full newspaper by the early 1870s. The early days of the Express was marked by several leadership changes which almost doomed the paper, until a brand new company, the Express Printing Company, took control in 1875. The Express eventually became a daily morning newspaper in 1878.
In January 1881 a new rival newspaper, the Evening Light , was first published by A. W. Gifford and J. P. Newcomb , who had been an early investor in the Express . [3] The Evening Light was published as an afternoon paper, as opposed to the morning Express . At first, the editors of the Express chose to ignore the upstart paper, but the Light soon grew in popularity at the turn of the 20th century. In 1906 the Daily Light was sold to E. B. Chandler, and in 1909 the Daily Light Publishing Company bought the San Antonio Gazette . From then until 1911 the paper was referred to as the Light and Gazette . Edward S. O'Reilly, known as Tex, was at one time managing editor. In 1911 Harrison L. Beach and Charles S. Diehl, veteran correspondents of national standing, moved to San Antonio and bought the Light and Gazette . Once again it was known as the Light . Diehl was a founder of the AP wire service. Beach and Diehl installed leased wire news service and published the first full stock market reports in a San Antonio paper. The Light became liberal-Democratic in its political views. While Beach and Diehl ran the paper, circulation increased from 11,000 to 25,000 copies daily. In 1918, the Express ownership, now renamed Express Publishing Company, launched its own afternoon paper, the San Antonio Evening News . Soon thereafter, a rivalry developed between workers of the Express and the News . In fact, some News workers dubbed a new office building as the News-Express building. In 1924, however, William Randolph Hearst bought the Light and instituted Hearst policies, and by 1945 the circulation was approximately 70,000.
The 1920s was marked by expansion by Express Publishing as the company started one of the city's first radio stations, WOAI , in 1922. Meanwhile, the company's future owners, in the form of William Randolph Hearst , purchased the Light . As the two rival companies entered the 1950s, the Express and the News both had higher readership numbers than the Light . However, the Light skyrocketed to the top of the market when it acquired a number of popular comic strips, like Dick Tracy . Over at Express Publishing , the company diversified further as they acquired a couple more radio stations, and a television station which they renamed KENS-TV . Those call letters were intended to stand for, K-Express News Station. In the 1960s, Express Publishing was sold to the Harte-Hanks newspaper group.
In 1973, with the Light beating the Express and the News in circulation numbers, a new ownership group emerged. Australian native Rupert Murdoch of News Corp bought the Express and the News from Harte-Hanks. Murdoch re-formatted the News as a more tabloid-styled paper, while the Express retained its original, conservative format. The Light was now forced to compete against two different styles of newspaper while at the same time trying to combat the growing costs of an afternoon circulation.
By September of 1984, the Express and the News merged into the Express-News and afternoon service was slowly discontinued, while the Light started getting into the morning circulation business in order to keep up. But under News Corp. , the Express-News adopted a more mainstream format and expanded its services to communities outside Bexar County . As a result, the Express-News became San Antonio's leading newspaper for good. By 1992, News Corp had diversified into movies and television and was looking to sell the Express-News . The Hearst Corporation, which still owned the Light , agreed to either sell or close the newspaper and acquire the Express-News in order to keep its stake in the San Antonio market. The Light never found a buyer and it went out of business in January 1993.
On February 13, 2016, the paper broke the news of the death of US Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia . [4]

Current business
Today, this Hearst Corp. newspaper is led by Publisher Susan Lynch Pape, who is also Hearst's Texas Group chief financial officer at the "Houston Chronicle" and the "San Antonio Express-News." Mike Leary is Senior Vice President and Editor of the "San Antonio Express-News." Jamie Stockwell is the managing editor.
In 2016, ExpressNews.com, the paper's subscriber website, was awarded an EPPY Award from Editor & Publisher for its digital storytelling and a narrative story about a man and his family's battle with ALS. Also that year, the site earned top prize in its division for best newspaper website in the National Headliner Awards.
In 2004, The Express-News earned its first-ever "Newspaper of the Year" honors from the Texas Associated Press Managing Editors. The Express-News was honored as the best daily paper in its big-city circulation category, topping competitors in Houston , Dallas , Fort Worth , and Austin .
The Express-News is a critic of the border wall pushed by U.S. President Donald Trump . The publication claims that the proposed barrier is based on misconceptions, one being that illegal aliens enter the United States by escaping detection or with the use of bogus documentation. Of the approximately 11 million estimated to lack legal credentials, The Express-News reported that 40 percent have overstayed visas and did not sneak through the border. The Express-News also notes that a considerable number of illegal aliens are not Mexicans. And the newspaper said that a border wall would keep more illegals from leaving the United States than prevent others from entering. The paper predicted that Trump administration policies will "never keep out the 40 percent of the 11 million unauthorized immigrants who enter legally but subsequently overstay (or otherwise violate) the terms of their visas." [5]
Opposed to crackdowns on illegal immigration, The Express-News in March 2017 quickly condemned U.S. Representative Steve King of Iowa's 4th congressional district after the Republican lawmaker used the term "somebody else's  babies" in what was considered a pejorative sense. On its editorial page, the newspaper said that "somebody else's babies" cannot be shunned aside but constitute the near majority of Texans: crop gatherers, cook and wait staff in restaurants, those repairing and replacing roofs, military personnel, and others credentialed in the professions, such as education, law, and medicine. "'Somebody else's babies' is old hat here and, demographically, this is Texas' certain future. ... We have to make it work. History says that mostly we do. American's success is grounded in its ability to assimilate a whole lot of 'somebody else's babies'. This mixing is our civilization," The Express-News concluded. [6]

Financial Times
The Financial Times ( FT ) is an English-language international daily newspaper with a special emphasis on business and economic news.
The paper, published and owned by Nikkei Inc. in Tokyo , was founded in 1888 by James Sheridan and Horatio Bottomley , and merged in 1945 with its closest rival, the Financial News (which had been founded in 1884).
The Financial Times has an average daily readership of 2.2 million people worldwide ( PwC audited figures, November 2011). FT.com has 4.5 million registered users and over 285,000 digital subscribers, as well as 600,000 paying users. FT Chinese has more than 1.7 million registered users. [2] The world editions of the Financial Times newspaper had a combined average daily circulation of 234,193 copies (88,000 for the UK edition) in January 2014. [3] In February 2014 the combined sale of the world editions of the Financial Times was 224,000 copies. In October 2013 the combined paid print and digital circulation of the Financial Times reached nearly 629,000 copies (282,000 for print and 387,000 for online sales), the highest circulation in its 125-year history. [4] In December 2016 print sales for the paper stood at 193,211. [1]
On 23 July 2015 Nikkei Inc. agreed to buy the Financial Times from Pearson for £844m ($1.32 billion). [5] On 30 November 2015 Nikkei completed the acquisition. [6]

History
The FT was launched as the London Financial Guide on 10 January 1888, renaming itself the Financial Times on 13 February the same year. Describing itself as the friend of "The Honest Financier, the Bona Fide Investor, the Respectable Broker, the Genuine Director, and the Legitimate Speculator", it was a four-page journal. The readership was the financial community of the City of London , its only rival being the slightly older and more daring Financial News . On 2 January 1893 the FT began printing on light salmon pink paper to distinguish it from the similarly named Financial News : at the time it was also cheaper to print on unbleached paper (several other more general newspapers such as The Sporting Times had the same policy), but nowadays it is more expensive as the paper has to be dyed specially. [7]
After 57 years of rivalry the Financial Times and the Financial News were merged in 1945 by Brendan Bracken to form a single six-page newspaper. The Financial Times brought a higher circulation while the Financial News provided much of the editorial talent. The Lex column was also introduced from Financial News . [8]
Pearson bought the paper in 1957. [9] Over the years the paper grew in size, readership and breadth of coverage. It established correspondents in cities around the world, reflecting early moves in the world economy towards globalisation . As cross-border trade and capital flows increased during the 1970s, the FT began international expansion, facilitated by developments in technology and the growing acceptance of English as the international language of business. On 1 January 1979 the first FT (Continental Europe edition) was printed outside the UK, in Frankfurt. Since then, with increased international coverage, the FT has become a global newspaper, printed in 22 locations with five international editions to serve the UK, continental Europe, the U.S., Asia and the Middle East. [10]
The European edition is distributed in continental Europe and Africa. It is printed Monday to Saturday at five centres across Europe reporting on matters concerning the European Union , the Euro and European corporate affairs. [11]
In 1994 FT launched a luxury lifestyle magazine, How To Spend It . In 2009 it launched a standalone website for the magazine. [12]
On 13 May 1995 the Financial Times group made its first foray into the online world with the launch of FT.com. This provided a summary of news from around the globe, which was supplemented in February 1996 with stock price coverage; the second-generation site was launched in spring 1996. The site was funded by advertising and contributed to the online advertising market in the UK in the late 1990s. Between 1997 and 2000 the site underwent several revamps and changes of strategy, as the FT Group and Pearson reacted to changes online. FT introduced subscription services in 2002. [13] FT.com is one of the few UK news sites successfully funded by individual subscription.
In 1997 the FT launched a U.S. edition, printed in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Dallas, Atlanta, Orlando and Washington, D.C., although the newspaper was first printed outside New York City in 1985. In September 1998 the FT became the first UK-based newspaper to sell more copies internationally than within the UK.
In 2000 the Financial Times started publishing a German-language edition, Financial Times Deutschland , with a news and editorial team based in Hamburg. Its initial circulation in 2003 was 90,000. It was originally a joint venture with a German publishing firm, Gruner + Jahr . In January 2008 the FT sold its 50% stake to its German partner. [14] FT Deutschland never made a profit and is said to have accumulated losses of €250 million over 12 years. It closed on 7 December 2012. [15] [16]
The Financial Times launched a new weekly supplement for the fund management industry on 4 February 2002. FT fund management (FTfm) was and still is distributed with the paper every Monday. FTfm is the world's largest-circulation fund management title. [17]
Since 2005 the FT has sponsored the annual ''Financial Times'' and Goldman Sachs Business Book of the Year Award . [18]
On 23 April 2007 the FT unveiled a "refreshed" version of the newspaper and introduced a new slogan, "We Live in Financial Times." [19]
In 2007 the FT pioneered a metered paywall , which lets visitors to its site read a limited number of free articles during any one month before asking them to pay. [20] Four years later the FT launched its HTML5 mobile internet app. Smartphones and tablets now drive 12% of subscriptions and 19% of traffic to FT.com. [21] In 2012 the number of digital subscribers surpassed the circulation of the newspaper for the first time and the FT drew almost half of its revenue from subscriptions rather than advertising. [22] [23]
Since 2010 the FT has been available on Bloomberg Terminal . [24]

Audience
According to the Global Capital Markets Survey, which measures readership habits amongst most senior financial decision makers in the world's largest financial institutions, the Financial Times is considered the most important business read, reaching 36% of the sample population, 11% more than The Wall Street Journal (WSJ), its main rival. The Economist , which was once 50% owned by FT , reaches 32%. FT' s The Banker also proved vital reading, reaching 24%. [25] In addition FT was regarded as the most credible publication in reporting financial and economic issues among the Worldwide Professional Investment Community audience. The Economist was also rated the third most credible title by most influential professional investors (those who personally managed asset funds worth $5 billion or more), while the WSJ was second. [26]

Content
The FT is split into two sections. The first section covers domestic and international news, editorial commentary on politics and economics from FT journalists such as Martin Wolf , Gillian Tett and Edward Luce , and opinion pieces from globally renowned leaders, policymakers, academics and commentators. The second section consists of financial data and news about companies and markets. Despite being generally regarded as primarily a financial newspaper, it does also contain TV listings, weather and other more informal articles.
About 110 of its 475 journalists are outside the UK.

The 
The Lex column is a daily feature on the back page of the first section. It features analyses and opinions covering global economics and finance. The FT calls Lex its agenda-setting column. The column first appeared on Monday, 1 October 1945. The name may originally have stood for Lex Mercatoria , a Latin expression meaning literally "merchant law". It was conceived by Hargreaves Parkinson for the Financial News in the 1930s and moved to the Financial Times when the two merged.
Lex boasts some distinguished alumni who have gone on to make careers in business and government – including Nigel Lawson (former Conservative Chancellor of the Exchequer), Richard Lambert (CBI director and former member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee), Martin Taylor (former chief executive of Barclays), John Makinson (chairman and chief executive of Penguin), John Gardiner (former chairman of Tesco), David Freud (former UBS banker and Labour adviser, now a Conservative peer), John Kingman (former head of UKFI and a banker at Rothschild's), George Graham (RBS banker), Andrew Balls (head of European portfolio management at PIMCO) and Jo Johnson (Conservative Member of Parliament for Orpington).

FT Weekend
The FT publishes a Saturday edition of the newspaper called the Financial Times Weekend . It consists of international economic and political news, Companies & Markets , Life & Arts , House & Home and FT Magazine .

How to Spend It
How to Spend It is a monthly magazine published with FT Weekend . Founded and launched by Julia Carrick [28] with Lucia van der Post as founding editor, [29] its articles concern luxury goods such as yachts , mansions , apartments , horlogerie , haute couture and automobiles, as well as fashion and columns by individuals in the arts, gardening, food, and hotel and travel industries. To celebrate its 15th anniversary, FT launched the on-line version of this publication, howtospendit.com, [30] on 3 October 2009. [29]
Some media commentators were taken aback by the online launch of a website supporting conspicuous consumption during the financial austerity of the late-2000s recession . [29] The magazine has been derided in rival publishers' blogs, as "repellent" in the Telegraph [31] and "a latter-day Ab Fab manual" in the Guardian . [32] A 'well-thumbed' copy of the supplement was found when rebel forces broke into Colonel Gaddafi 's Tripoli compound during the 2011 Libyan Civil War . [33]

Editorial stance
The FT advocates free markets [34] and is in favour of globalisation . During the 1980s it supported Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan 's monetarist policies. [35] [36] It has supported the UK Labour Party in the past, including at the general election in 1992 when Neil Kinnock was Labour leader.
The FT' s editorials tend to be moderately pro-Europe, supporting the European Union in the context of a common economic market and opposing political integration. [37] [38] The FT was firmly opposed to the Iraq War . [37]
In the U.S. presidential election in 2008 the Financial Times endorsed Barack Obama . While it raised concerns over hints of protectionism , it praised his ability to "engage the country's attention," his calls for a bipartisan politics, and his plans for " comprehensive health-care reform ". [39] The FT favoured Obama again in 2012. [40]
In the general election in the UK in 2010 the FT was receptive to the Liberal Democrats ' positions on civil liberties and political reform, and praised the then Labour leader Gordon Brown for his response to the global financial crisis of 2007–2008 , but on balance it backed the Conservatives while questioning their tendency to Euroscepticism . [41] At the subsequent general election in 2015 , the FT called for the continuation of the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition that had governed for the previous five years. [42]

Ownership and related publications
The Financial Times Group, a division of Pearson PLC since 1957, was sold in July 2015 to the Japanese company Nikkei for £844m. [43] Until August 2015 the FT group had a 50% shareholding in The Economist , which was sold to the Agnelli family for £469 million. [44]
Related publications include the Financial Times , FT.com, FT Search Inc., the publishing imprint FT Press and numerous joint ventures. In November 2013 it agreed to sell Mergermarket , an online intelligence reporting business, to the London private equity investor BC Partners. [45] In addition, the FT Group has a unit called FT Business, which is a provider of specialist information on retail, personal and institutional finance segments. It publishes The Banker , Money Management and Financial Adviser (a publication targeted at professional advisers), This Is Africa , fDi intelligence and Professional Wealth Management (PWM). [2]
The Financial Times Group announced the beta launch of newssift, [46] part of FT Search, in March 2009. Newssift.com is a next-generation search tool for business professionals that indexes millions of articles from thousands of global business news sources, not just the FT. The Financial Times Group acquired Money Media [47] (an online news and commentary site for the industry) and Exec-Appointments [48] (an online recruitment specialist site for the executive jobs market). The FT Group once had a 13.85% stake in Business Standard Ltd of India, the publisher of the Business Standard . It sold this stake in April 2008 and has entered into an agreement with Network 18 to launch the Financial Times in India, [49] [50] though it is speculated that they may find it difficult to do so, as the brand 'Financial Times' in India is owned by The Times Group , [51] the publisher of The Times of India and The Economic Times . The group also publishes America's Intelligence Wire , a daily general newswire service. [52]
The Financial Times' Financial Publishing division (formerly FT Business) provides print and online content for retail, personal and institutional finance audiences. Examples of publications and services include: Investors Chronicle , a personal finance magazine and website; "FT Money", a weekly personal finance supplement in "FT Weekend"; FT Wealth , a magazine for the global high-net-worth community and FTfm, a weekly review of the global fund management industry, Money Management and Financial Adviser (a publication targeted at professional advisers). The institutional segment includes: The Banker , This Is Africa , fDi Intelligence and Professional Wealth Management (PWM). [53] Money-Media, a separate arm of Financial Publishing, delivers a range of digital information services for fund management professionals around the globe, including: Ignites, Ignites Europe, Ignites Asia, FundFire and BoardIQ. Financial Publishing includes publications ( Pensions Expert and Deutsche Pensions & Investmentnachrichten ) and events ( Investment Expert ) for the European pensions industry. The group also publishes MandateWire, a financial information company that provides sales and market intelligence for investment professionals in North America, Europe and Asia. [2]
FT Knowledge is an associated company which offers educational products and services. FT Knowledge has offered the "Introducing the City" course (which is a series of Wednesday night lectures and seminars, as well as weekend events) during each autumn and spring since 2000.
FT Predict is a prediction market contest hosted by the Financial Times that allows users to buy and sell contracts based on future financial, political, and news-driven events by spending fictional Financial Times Dollars (FT$). Based on the assumptions displayed in James Surowiecki's The Wisdom of Crowds , this contest allows people to use prediction markets to observe future occurrences while competing for weekly and monthly prizes.
The Financial Times also ran a business-related game called "In the Pink" (a phrase meaning "in good health", also a reference to the colour of the newspaper and to the phrase "in the red" meaning to be making a loss). Each player was put in the virtual role of Chief Executive and the goal was to have the highest profit when the game closes. The winner of the game (the player who makes the highest profit) was to receive a real monetary prize of £10,000. The game ran from 1 May to 28 June 2006.

Indices
The Financial Times collates and publishes a number of financial market indices, which reflect the changing value of their constituent parts. The longest-running of these was the former Financial News Index , started on 1 July 1935 by the Financial News . The FT published a similar index; this was replaced by the Financial News Index —which was then renamed the Financial Times (FT) Index —on 1 January 1947. The index started as an index of industrial shares, and companies with dominant overseas interests were excluded, such as the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (later BP ), British-American Tobacco , Lever Brothers (later Unilever ) and Shell . The oil and financial sectors were included decades later. [54]
The FTSE All-Share Index , the first of the FTSE series of indices, was created in 1962, comprising the largest 594 UK companies by market capitalisation. [54] The letters F-T-S-E represented that FTSE was a joint venture between the Financial Times ( F-T ) and the London Stock Exchange ( S-E ). On 13 February 1984 the FTSE 100 was introduced, representing about eighty percent of the London Stock Exchange's value. [54] In 1995 FTSE Group was made an independent company. The first of several overseas offices was opened in New York City in 1999; Paris followed in early 2000, Hong Kong, Frankfurt and San Francisco in 2001, Madrid in 2002 and Tokyo in 2003.
Other well-known FTSE indices include the FTSE 350 Index , the FTSE SmallCap Index , the FTSE AIM UK 50 Index and FTSE AIM 100 Index as well as the FTSE AIM All-Share Index for stocks, and the FTSE UK Gilt Indices for government bonds.

People
In July 2006 the FT announced a "New Newsroom" project to integrate the newspaper more closely with FT.com. At the same time it announced plans to cut the editorial staff from 525 to 475. In August 2006 it announced that all the required job cuts had been achieved through voluntary layoffs.
A number of former FT journalists have gone on to high-profile jobs in journalism, politics and business. Robert Thomson , previously the paper's US managing editor, was the editor of The Times and is now the publisher of the Wall Street Journal . Will Lewis , a former New York correspondent and News Editor for the FT , is the current editor of the Daily Telegraph . Dominic Lawson went on to become editor of the Sunday Telegraph until he was sacked in 2005. Andrew Adonis , a former education correspondent, became an adviser on education to the then British Prime Minister, Tony Blair , and was given a job as an education minister and a seat in the House of Lords after the 2005 election. Ed Balls became chief economic adviser to the Treasury, working closely with Gordon Brown , the chancellor of the exchequer (or finance minister), before being elected a Member of Parliament in 2005, and became Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families in July 2007. Bernard Gray , a former defence correspondent and Lex columnist, was chief executive of the publishing company CMP before becoming chief executive of TSL Education, publisher of the Times Educational Supplement . David Jones, at one time the FT Night Editor, then became Head of IT. He was a key figure in the newspaper's transformation from hot metal to electronic composition and then onto full-page pagination in the 1990s. He went on to become Head of Technology for the Trinity Mirror Group.
Sir Geoffrey Owen was the editor of the Financial Times from 1981 to 1990. He joined the Centre for Economic Performance (CEP) at the London School of Economics as Director of Business Policy in 1991 and was appointed Senior Fellow, Institute of Management, in 1997. He continues his work there. [56] During his tenure at the FT he had to deal with rapid technological change and issues related to it, for example repetitive strain injury (RSI), which affected dozens of FT journalists, reporters and staff in the late 1980s.

W
W ( named double-u , [note 1] plural double-ues [1] [2] ) is the 23rd letter in the modern English and ISO basic Latin alphabets .

History
The sounds / w / (spelled ⟨V⟩) and / b / (spelled ⟨B⟩) of Classical Latin developed into a bilabial fricative /β/ between vowels in Early Medieval Latin . Therefore, ⟨V⟩ no longer adequately represented the labial-velar approximant sound /w/ of Germanic phonology .
The Germanic /w/ phoneme was therefore written as ⟨VV⟩ or ⟨uu⟩ (⟨ u ⟩ and ⟨ v ⟩ becoming distinct only by the Early Modern period ) by the 7th or 8th century by the earliest writers of Old English and Old High German . [3] Gothic (not Latin-based ), by contrast, simply used a letter based on the Greek Υ for the same sound. The digraph ⟨VV⟩/⟨uu⟩ was also used in Medieval Latin to represent Germanic names, including Gothic ones like Wamba .
It is from this ⟨uu⟩ digraph that the modern name "double U" derives. The digraph was commonly used in the spelling of Old High German, but only sporadically in Old English, where the /w/ sound was usually represented by the runic ⟨Ƿ⟩ wynn . In early Middle English , following the 11th-century Norman Conquest , ⟨uu⟩ gained popularity and by 1300 it had taken Wynn's place in common use.
Scribal realization of the digraph could look like a pair of Vs whose branches crossed in the middle. An obsolete, cursive form found in the nineteenth century in both English and German was in the form of an ⟨n⟩ whose rightmost branch curved around as in a cursive ⟨v⟩. [4] [ citation needed ]
The shift from the digraph ⟨VV⟩ to the distinct ligature ⟨W⟩ is thus gradual, and is only apparent in abecedaria , explicit listings of all individual letters. It was probably considered a separate letter by the 14th century in both Middle English and Middle German orthography, although it remained an outsider, not really considered part of the Latin alphabet proper, as expressed by Valentin Ickelshamer in the 16th century, who complained that
In Middle High German (and possibly already in late Old High German), the West Germanic phoneme /w/ became realized as [ v ] ; this is why, today, the German ⟨w⟩ represents that sound. There is no phonological distinction between [w] and [v] in contemporary German.

Use in writing systems

English
English uses ⟨w⟩ to represent /w/ . There are also a number of words beginning with a written ⟨w⟩ that is silent in most dialects before a (pronounced) ⟨r⟩, remaining from usage in Old English in which the ⟨w⟩ was pronounced: wreak, wrap, wreck, wrench, wroth, wrinkle , etc. Certain dialects of Scottish English still distinguish this digraph.

Other languages
In Europe, there are only a few languages that use ⟨w⟩ in native words and all are located in a central-western European zone between Cornwall and Poland. English, German, Low German , Dutch , Frisian , Welsh , Cornish , Breton , Walloon , Polish , Kashubian , Sorbian , Resian and Scandinavian dialects use ⟨w⟩ in native words. German, Polish and Kashubian use it for the voiced labiodental fricative /v/ (with Polish and related Kashubian using Ł for /w/ ), and Dutch uses it for /ʋ/ . Unlike its use in other languages, the letter is used in Welsh and Cornish to represent the vowel /u/ as well as the related approximant consonant /w/ .
Modern German dialects generally have only [v] or [ʋ] for West Germanic /w/ , but [w] or [β̞] is still heard allophonically for ⟨w⟩, especially in the clusters ⟨schw⟩, ⟨zw⟩, and ⟨qu⟩. Some Bavarian dialects preserve a "light" initial [w] , such as in wuoz (Standard German weiß [vaɪs] '[I] know'). The Classical Latin [β] is heard in the Southern German greeting Servus ('hello' or 'goodbye').
In Dutch , ⟨w⟩ became a labiodental approximant /ʋ/ (with the exception of words with -⟨eeuw⟩, which have /eːβ/ , or other diphthongs containing -⟨uw⟩). In many Dutch speaking areas, such as Flanders and Suriname , the /β/ pronunciation is used at all times.
In Finnish , ⟨w⟩ is seen as a variant of ⟨v⟩ and not a separate letter. It is, however, recognised and maintained in the spelling of some old names, reflecting an earlier German spelling standard, and in some modern loan words. In all cases, it is pronounced /ʋ/.
In Danish , Norwegian and Swedish , ⟨w⟩ is named double-v and not double-u. In these languages, the letter only exists in old names, loanwords and foreign words. (Foreign words are distinguished from loanwords by having a significantly lower level of integration in the language.) It is usually pronounced /v/, but in some words of English origin it may be pronounced /w/. [6] [7] The letter was officially introduced in the Danish and Swedish alphabets as late as 1980 and 2006, respectively, despite having been in use for much longer. It had been recognized since the conception of modern Norwegian, with the earliest official orthography rules of 1907. [8] ⟨W⟩ was earlier seen as a variant of ⟨v⟩, and ⟨w⟩ as a letter (double-v) is still commonly replaced by ⟨v⟩ in speech (e.g. WC being pronounced as VC, www as VVV, WHO as VHO, etc.) The two letters were sorted as equals before ⟨w⟩ was officially recognized, and that practice is still recommended when sorting names in Sweden. [9] In modern slang, some native speakers may pronounce ⟨w⟩ more closely to the origin of the loanword than the official /v/ pronunciation.
Multiple dialects of Swedish and Danish use the sound however. In Denmark notably in Jutland , where the northern half use it extensively in traditional dialect , and multiple places in Sweden. It is used in southern Swedish, for example in Halland where the words "wesp" (wisp) and "wann" (water) are traditionally used. [10] In northern and western Sweden there is also dialects with /w/. Elfdalian is a good example, which is one of many dialects where the Old Norse difference between v (/w/) and f (/v/ or /f/) is preserved. Thus "warg" from Old Norse "vargr", but "åvå" from Old Norse "hafa".
In the alphabets of most modern Romance languages (excepting far northern French and Walloon ), ⟨w⟩ is used mostly in foreign names and words recently borrowed ( le week-end , il watt , el kiwi ). The digraph ⟨ou⟩ is used for /w/ in native French words; ⟨oi⟩ is /wa/ or /wɑ/ . In Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese, [w] is a non-syllabic variant of /u/ , spelled ⟨u⟩.
The Japanese language uses "W", pronounced /daburu/, as an ideogram meaning "double". [11]
In Italian, while the letter ⟨w⟩ is not considered part of the standard Italian alphabet , the character is often used in place of Viva (hooray for...), while the same symbol written upside down indicates abbasso (down with...).
In Vietnamese , ⟨w⟩ is called vê đúp , from the French double vé . It is not included in the standard Vietnamese alphabet , but it is often used as a substitute for qu- in literary dialect and very informal writing. [12] [13]
"W" is the 24th letter in the Modern Filipino Alphabet and is pronounced as it is in English. However, in the old Filipino alphabet, Abakada , it was the 19th letter and was pronounced "wah"; there was an equivalent letter in the old Baybayin script of the Philippines. [14]

Other systems
In the International Phonetic Alphabet , ⟨ w ⟩ is used for the voiced labial-velar approximant .

Other uses
W is the symbol for the chemical element tungsten , after its German (and alternative English) name, Wolfram .

Name
"Double-u" is the only modern English letter name with more than one syllable. Sometimes considered part of the alphabet in the past were the ligature, œ (its name pronounced similar to ethel ), and the formerly common in print & , ampersand . The archaic pronunciation of Z was also two syllables, izzard . With the arguable exception of the letter H , W is currently the only English letter whose name is not pronounced with any of the sounds that the letter typically makes.
Some speakers shorten the name "double u" into "dub-u" or just "dub"; for example, University of Wisconsin , University of Washington , University of Wyoming , University of Waterloo , University of the Western Cape and University of Western Australia are all known colloquially as "U Dub", and the automobile company Volkswagen , abbreviated "VW", is sometimes pronounced "V-Dub". [15] The fact that many website URLs require a " www ." prefix has been influential in promoting these shortened pronunciations, as many speakers find the phrase "double-u double-u double-u" inconveniently long.
In other Germanic languages , including German, its name is similar to that of English V . In many languages, its name literally means "double v": Portuguese duplo vê , [note 2] Spanish doble ve (though it can be spelled uve doble ), [16] [note 3] French double vé , Icelandic tvöfalt vaff , Czech dvojité vé , Finnish kaksois-vee , etc.
Former U.S. president George W. Bush was given the nickname "Dubya" after the colloquial pronunciation of his middle initial in Texas , where he spent much of his childhood.

arXiv
The arXiv (pronounced " archive ") [2] is a repository of electronic preprints , known as e-prints , of scientific papers in the fields of mathematics , physics , astronomy , computer science , quantitative biology , statistics , and quantitative finance, which can be accessed online. In many fields of mathematics and physics, almost all scientific papers are self-archived on the arXiv repository. Begun on August 14, 1991, arXiv.org passed the half-million article milestone on October 3, 2008, [3] [4] and hit a million by the end of 2014. [5] [6] By 2014 the submission rate had grown to more than 8,000 per month. [6] [7]

History
The arXiv was made possible by the low-bandwidth TeX file format, which allowed scientific papers to be easily transmitted over the Internet and rendered client-side . [8] Around 1990, Joanne Cohn began emailing physics preprints to colleagues as TeX files, but the number of papers being sent soon filled mailboxes to capacity. Paul Ginsparg recognized the need for central storage, and in August 1991 he created a central repository mailbox stored at the Los Alamos National Laboratory which could be accessed from any computer. Additional modes of access were soon added: FTP in 1991, Gopher in 1992, and the World Wide Web in 1993. [6] [9] The term e-print was quickly adopted to describe the articles.
It began as a physics archive, called the LANL preprint archive, but soon expanded to include astronomy, mathematics, computer science, nonlinear science, quantitative biology and, most recently, statistics. Its original domain name was xxx.lanl.gov . Due to LANL's lack of interest in the rapidly expanding technology, in 1999 Ginsparg changed institutions to Cornell University and changed the name of the repository to arXiv.org . [10] It is now hosted principally by Cornell, with 8 mirrors around the world. [11]
Its existence was one of the precipitating factors that led to the current movement in scientific publishing known as open access . Mathematicians and scientists regularly upload their papers to arXiv.org for worldwide access [12] and sometimes for reviews before they are published in peer-reviewed journals . Ginsparg was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship in 2002 for his establishment of arXiv.
The annual budget for arXiv is approximately $826,000 for 2013 to 2017, funded jointly by Cornell University Library, the Simons Foundation (in both gift and challenge grant forms) and annual fee income from member institutions. [13] This model arose in 2010, when Cornell sought to broaden the financial funding of the project by asking institutions to make annual voluntary contributions based on the amount of download usage by each institution. Annual donations were envisaged to vary in size between $2,300 to $4,000, based on each institution’s usage. As of 14 January 2014 [update] , 174 institutions have pledged support for the period 2013–2017 on this basis, with a projected revenue from this source of approximately $340,000. [14]
In September 2011, Cornell University Library took overall administrative and financial responsibility for arXiv's operation and development. Ginsparg was quoted in the Chronicle of Higher Education as saying it "was supposed to be a three-hour tour, not a life sentence". [15] However, Ginsparg remains on the arXiv Scientific Advisory Board and on the arXiv Physics Advisory Committee .

Peer review
Although the arXiv is not peer reviewed , a collection of moderators for each area review the submissions ; they may recategorize any that are deemed off-topic, [16] or reject submissions that are not scientific papers. The lists of moderators for many sections of the arXiv are publicly available, [17] but moderators for most of the physics sections remain unlisted.
Additionally, an "endorsement" system was introduced in 2004 as part of an effort to ensure content is relevant and of interest to current research in the specified disciplines. [18] Under the system, for categories that use it, an author must be endorsed by an established arXiv author before being allowed to submit papers to those categories. Endorsers are not asked to review the paper for errors, but to check whether the paper is appropriate for the intended subject area. [16] New authors from recognized academic institutions generally receive automatic endorsement, which in practice means that they do not need to deal with the endorsement system at all. However, the endorsement system has attracted criticism for allegedly restricting scientific inquiry. [19]
A majority of the e-prints are also submitted to journals for publication, but some work, including some very influential papers, remain purely as e-prints and are never published in a peer-reviewed journal. A well-known example of the latter is an outline of a proof of Thurston's geometrization conjecture , including the Poincaré conjecture as a particular case, uploaded by Grigori Perelman in November 2002. [20] Perelman appears content to forgo the traditional peer-reviewed journal process, stating: "If anybody is interested in my way of solving the problem, it's all there [on the arXiv] – let them go and read about it". [21] Despite this non-traditional method of publication, other mathematicians recognized this work by offering the Fields Medal and Clay Mathematics Millennium Prizes to Perelman, both of which he refused. [22]
While the arXiv does contain some dubious e-prints, such as those claiming to refute famous theorems or proving famous conjectures such as Fermat's last theorem using only high-school mathematics, they are "surprisingly rare". [23] [ better source needed ] The arXiv generally re-classifies these works, e.g. in "General mathematics", rather than deleting them. [24]

Submission formats
Papers can be submitted in any of several formats, including LaTeX , and PDF printed from a word processor other than TeX or LaTeX. The submission is rejected by the arXiv software if generating the final PDF file fails, if any image file is too large, or if the total size of the submission is too large. arXiv now allows one to store and modify an incomplete submission, and only finalize the submission when ready. The time stamp on the article is set when the submission is finalized.

Access
The standard access route is through the arXiv.org website or one of several mirrors. Several other interfaces and access routes have also been created by other un-associated organisations. These include the University of California, Davis 's front , a web portal that offers additional search functions and a more self-explanatory interface for arXiv.org, and is referred to by some mathematicians as (the) Front. [25] A similar function used to be offered by eprintweb.org, launched in September 2006 by the Institute of Physics , and was switched off on June 30, 2014. Carnegie Mellon provides Table arXiv , [26] a search engine for tables extracted from arXiv publications. Google Scholar and Live Search Academic (now defunct) can also be used to search for items in arXiv. [27] A full text and author search engine for arXiv is provided by Scientillion . [28] Finally, researchers can select sub-fields and receive daily e-mailings or RSS feeds of all submissions in them.

Copyright
Files on arXiv can have a number of different copyright statuses: [29]

Common Knowledge?: An Ethnography of Wikipedia is a 2014 book about Wikipedia 's community of contributors, by author Dariusz Jemielniak , who is a contributor himself.

Reviews
A reviewer for Vice called the book "both primer and detailed study on the habits of Wikipedians". [1]
A writer for Inside Higher Ed said that the "book offers a management expert's inside view of how it has tried, for better or worse, to arrive at a self-sustaining and novel form of self-management". [2]
In Pacific Standard , the reviewer said the book was "a detailed ethnographic study of a paradoxical culture that is at once egalitarian and hierarchical, rule bound and consensus driven, collaborative and conflict driven". [3]
In Forbes the reviewer gave summaries of concepts covered, including Wikipedia's rule sets, tension between experienced and inexperienced contributors, conflicts between subject matter experts and fact checkers, and the implications of Wikipedia having a large audience. [4]

Cambridge University Press
Cambridge University Press ( CUP ) is the publishing business of the University of Cambridge . Granted letters patent by Henry VIII in 1534, it is the world's oldest publishing house and the second-largest university press in the world (after Oxford University Press ). [1] [2] It also holds letters patent as the Queen's Printer . [3]
The Press's mission is "To further the University's mission by disseminating knowledge in the pursuit of education, learning and research at the highest international levels of excellence." [4]
Cambridge University Press is a department of the University of Cambridge and is both an academic and educational publisher . With a global sales presence, publishing hubs, and offices in more than 40 countries , it publishes over 50,000 titles by authors from over 100 countries. Its publishing includes academic journals , monographs , reference works , textbooks , and English-language teaching and learning publications. Cambridge University Press is a charitable enterprise that transfers part of its annual surplus back to the university.

History
Cambridge University Press is both the oldest publishing house in the world and the oldest university press. It originated from Letters Patent granted to the University of Cambridge by Henry VIII in 1534, and has been producing books continuously since the first University Press book was printed. Cambridge is one of the two privileged presses (the other being Oxford University Press ). Authors published by Cambridge have included John Milton , William Harvey , Isaac Newton , Bertrand Russell , and Stephen Hawking . [5]
University printing began in Cambridge when the first practising University Printer, Thomas Thomas , set up a printing house on the site of what became the Senate House lawn – a few yards from where the Press's bookshop now stands. In those days, the Stationers' Company in London jealously guarded its monopoly of printing, which partly explains the delay between the date of the University's Letters Patent and the printing of the first book.
In 1591, Thomas's successor, John Legate, printed the first Cambridge Bible, an octavo edition of the popular Geneva Bible . The London Stationers objected strenuously, claiming that they had the monopoly on Bible printing. The university's response was to point out the provision in its charter to print 'all manner of books'. Thus began the Press's tradition of publishing the Bible, a tradition that has endured for over four centuries, beginning with the Geneva Bible, and continuing with the Authorized Version , the Revised Version , the New English Bible and the Revised English Bible . The restrictions and compromises forced upon Cambridge by the dispute with the London Stationers did not really come to an end until the scholar Richard Bentley was given the power to set up a 'new-style press' in 1696. In July 1697 the Duke of Somerset made a loan of £ 200 to the university "towards the printing house and presse" and James Halman , Registrary of the University, lent £100 for the same purpose. [6]
It was in Bentley's time, in 1698, that a body of senior scholars ('the Curators', known from 1733 as 'the Syndics') was appointed to be responsible to the university for the Press's affairs. The Press Syndicate's publishing committee still meets regularly (eighteen times a year), and its role still includes the review and approval of the Press's planned output. John Baskerville became University Printer in the mid-eighteenth century. Baskerville's concern was the production of the finest possible books using his own type-design and printing techniques.
Baskerville wrote, "The importance of the work demands all my attention; not only for my own (eternal) reputation; but (I hope) also to convince the world, that the University in the honour done me has not entirely misplaced their favours." Caxton would have found nothing to surprise him if he had walked into the Press's printing house in the eighteenth century: all the type was still being set by hand; wooden presses, capable of producing only 1,000 sheets a day at best, were still in use; and books were still being individually bound by hand. A technological breakthrough was badly needed, and it came when Lord Stanhope perfected the making of stereotype plates. This involved making a mould of the whole surface of a page of type and then casting plates from that mould. The Press was the first to use this technique, and in 1805 produced the technically successful and much-reprinted Cambridge Stereotype Bible.
By the 1850s the Press was using steam-powered machine presses, employing two to three hundred people, and occupying several buildings in the Silver Street and Mill Lane area, including the one that the Press still occupies, the Pitt Building (1833), which was built specifically for the Press and in honour of William Pitt the Younger . Under the stewardship of C. J. Clay, who was University Printer from 1854 to 1882, the Press increased the size and scale of its academic and educational publishing operation. An important factor in this increase was the inauguration of its list of schoolbooks (including what came to be known as the 'Pitt Press Series'). During Clay's administration, the Press also undertook a sizable co-publishing venture with Oxford: the Revised Version of the Bible, which was begun in 1870 and completed in 1885. It was in this period as well that the Syndics of the Press turned down what later became the Oxford English Dictionary —a proposal for which was brought to Cambridge by James Murray (lexicographer) before he turned to Oxford.
The appointment of R. T. Wright as Secretary of the Press Syndicate in 1892 marked the beginning of the Press's development as a modern publishing business with a clearly defined editorial policy and administrative structure. It was Wright (with two great historians, Lord Acton and F. W. Maitland ) who devised the plan for one of the most distinctive Cambridge contributions to publishing—the Cambridge Histories.
The Cambridge Modern History was published between 1902 and 1912. Nine years later the Press issued the first volumes of the freshly edited complete works of Shakespeare , a project of nearly equal scope that was not finished until 1966. The Press's list in science and mathematics began to thrive, with men of the stature of Albert Einstein and Ernest Rutherford subsequently becoming Press authors. The Press's impressive contribution to journal publishing began in 1893, and today it publishes over 300 journals.
In 1992 the Press opened its own bookshop at 1 Trinity Street , in the centre of Cambridge. Books have been sold continuously on this site since at least 1581, perhaps even as early as 1505, making it the oldest known bookshop site in Britain. [7]
In 2012 the Press decided to end the tradition of printing after 428 years and now uses third parties to provide all of its print publications.

Governance
The Press has, since 1698, been governed by the Press 'Syndics' (originally known as the 'Curators'), [8] made up of 18 senior academics from the University of Cambridge who represent a wide variety of subjects. [9] The Syndicate has several sub-committees: an Operating Board, an Academic Publishing Committee, an ELT & Education Publishing Committee, and an Audit Committee. The Operating Board oversees the Press's financial, strategic and operational affairs, while the two Publishing Committees provide quality assurance and formal approval of the publishing strategy. [10] The Chair of the Syndicate is currently Sir David Bell . The operational responsibility of the Press is delegated by the Syndics to the Press's Chief Executive, Peter Phillips, and the Press Board.

Structure
Cambridge University Press is a global organisation with three market facing publishing groups. These are:

Academic publishing
This group publishes academic books and journals across science, technology, medicine, humanities, and social sciences. [11] The group also publishes bibles, and the Press is one of only two publishers entitled to publish the Book of Common Prayer and the King James Version of the Bible in England. [12]

Cambridge English Language Teaching (ELT)
The Cambridge English group publishes English language teaching courses and resources for all ages around the world. [11] The group works closely with Cambridge English Language Assessment to provide solutions that improve language proficiency, aligned to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages, or CEFR.

Education
The Education group delivers educational products and solutions for primary, secondary and international schools, and Education Ministries worldwide.

Electronic and digital developments
Owing to the changes taking place in the way that books and content are bought and accessed, Cambridge believes that digital products, services and solutions could account for two-thirds of its sales by 2020. [13]
Since 2010, Cambridge has provided electronic book content through the website Cambridge Books Online. [14] For many years, all of Cambridge's journals have been published in both hard copy format and online.
Other recent ventures include Race to Learn, curriculum software that uses Formula One to encourage group working in primary school children, [15] published through Cambridge–Hitachi, a joint venture between Cambridge University Press and Hitachi Software Engineering that produces software for teaching on interactive whiteboards in schools.

Controversies

Alms for Jihad
In 2007, controversy arose over CUP's decision to destroy all remaining copies of its 2006 book, Alms for Jihad: Charity and Terrorism in the Islamic World , by Burr and Collins, as part of the settlement of a lawsuit brought by Saudi billionaire Khalid bin Mahfouz . [16] Within hours, Alms for Jihad became one of the 100 most sought after titles on Amazon.com and eBay in the United States . CUP sent a letter to libraries asking them to remove copies from circulation. CUP subsequently sent out copies of an "errata" sheet for the book.
The American Library Association issued a recommendation to libraries still holding Alms for Jihad : "Given the intense interest in the book, and the desire of readers to learn about the controversy first hand, we recommend that U.S. libraries keep the book available for their users." The publisher's decision did not have the support of the book's authors and was criticised by some who claimed it was incompatible with freedom of speech and with freedom of the press and that it indicated that English libel laws were excessively strict. [17] [18] In a New York Times Book Review (7 October 2007), United States Congressman Frank R. Wolf described Cambridge's settlement as "basically a book burning." [19] CUP pointed out that, at that time, it had already sold most of its copies of the book.
Cambridge defended its actions, saying it had acted responsibly and that it is a global publisher with a duty to observe the laws of many different countries. [20]

Cambridge University Press, 
In this ongoing case, begun in 2008, CUP et al. accused Georgia State University of infringement of copyright.

Community work
The Press has been recognised on several occasions for its commitment to community involvement and social responsibility, and it has stated that public engagement is an important part of the Press's role, by undertaking educational projects and fundraising. [21]
The Press partnered with Bookshare in 2010 to make their books accessible to people with qualified print disabilities . Under the terms of the digital rights licence agreement, the Press delivers academic and scholarly books from all of its regional publishing centres on the world to Bookshare for conversion into accessible formats. People with qualified print disabilities around the world can download the books for a nominal Bookshare membership fee and read them using a computer or other assistive technology, with voice generated by text-to-speech technology, as well as options for digital Braille. [22]

Open access
CUP is one of thirteen publishers to participate in the Knowledge Unlatched pilot, a global library consortium approach to funding open access books . [23] CUP is a member of the Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association .

Virginia Postrel
Virginia Inman Postrel (born January 14, 1960) is an American political and cultural writer of broadly libertarian , or classical liberal , views. [2]
She is best known for her non-fiction books, The Future and Its Enemies and The Substance of Style . In the former she explains her philosophy, " dynamism ", a forward-looking and change-seeking philosophy that generally favors unregulated organization through " spontaneous order ". She contrasts it with " stasis ", a philosophy that favors top-down control and regulation and is marked by desire to maintain the present state of affairs. [3] In November 2013, she published a third book, The Power of Glamour , which defined glamour as "nonverbal rhetoric" that “leads us to feel that the life we dream of exists, and to desire it even more.” [4]

Early life and education
Virginia Inman was born and raised in Greenville, South Carolina . Her father was an engineer and her mother was a homemaker who later went on to get her master's degree and teach at the college level. Virginia went on to college at Princeton University, graduating in 1982 with a degree in English Literature. [1]

Career
Postrel was editor-in-chief of Reason from July 1989 to January 2000, and remained on the masthead as editor-at-large through 2001. Prior to that, she was a reporter for Inc. and the Wall Street Journal . [5] She currently serves on the Board of Directors of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE). [6] From 2000 to 2006, she wrote an economics column for the New York Times and from 2006 to 2009 she wrote the "Commerce and Culture" column for The Atlantic . [7] She also appeared on the last episode of the third season of Penn and Teller 's Bullshit! .
Postrel wrote the biweekly column "Commerce & Culture" for the Wall Street Journal until April 2011. Since May 2011, she has written a biweekly column for Bloomberg View .

Health care, bioethics, and aesthetics
Postrel has written several articles on health care and bioethics, including accounts of her own experiences.
In March 2006 Postrel donated a kidney to an acquaintance, writer Sally Satel . [8] [9] She has recounted the experience, and referred to it in several subsequent articles and blog posts, many of which are critical of legal prohibitions against compensating organ donors. In some of the pieces, she discusses strategies for working around these restrictions, such as organ donor transplant chains. [10] [11]
In her March 2009 article "My Drug Problem" in The Atlantic , Postrel wrote about her own experience of being treated for breast cancer with the expensive drug Herceptin . [12] [13] She questioned if such a costly treatment would be available to others and if the risky research that makes such innovative treatments possible would be profitable under the proposed health care reforms in the United States.
Postrel has also referred to her experience as a cancer patient in her writing about the importance of design aesthetics in hospitals and the competitive forces that drive them to create more attractive environments for patients. [14] This ties into the thesis of her second book, that beauty is more than simply a superficial, frivolous trait and can go more than skin deep. Notions of beauty and desirability, and thoughts on what makes good design good beyond the needs of sound engineering , inform her work at the "Deep Glamour" blog.

Wikimedia Foundation
The Wikimedia Foundation, Inc. ( WMF ) is an American non-profit and charitable organization headquartered in San Francisco , California . It is mostly known for participating in the Wikimedia movement . It owns the internet domain names of most movement projects and hosts sites like Wikipedia . The foundation was founded in 2003 by Jimmy Wales as a way to fund Wikipedia and its sister projects through non-profit means. [5] [6]
As of 2015 [update] , the foundation employs over 280 people, with annual revenues in excess of US$ 75 million . [7] Christophe Henner is chair of the board . [8] Katherine Maher is the executive director since March 2016.

Goal
The Wikimedia Foundation has stated its goal is to develop and maintain open content , wiki -based projects and to provide the full contents of those projects to the public free of charge . [9] Another main objective of the Wikimedia Foundation is political advocacy . [10]
The Wikimedia Foundation was granted section 501(c)(3) status by the U.S. Internal Revenue Code as a public charity in 2005. [11] Its National Taxonomy of Exempt Entities (NTEE) code is B60 ( Adult , Continuing education ). [12] [13] The foundation's by-laws declare a statement of purpose of collecting and developing educational content and to disseminate it effectively and globally. [14]

History
In 2001, Jimmy Wales , an Internet entrepreneur , and Larry Sanger , an online community organizer and philosophy professor, founded Wikipedia as an Internet encyclopedia to supplement Nupedia . The project was originally funded by Bomis , Wales' for-profit business. As Wikipedia's popularity skyrocketed, revenues to fund the project stalled. [5] Since Wikipedia was depleting Bomis' resources, Wales and Sanger thought of a charity model to fund the project. [5] The Wikimedia Foundation was incorporated in Florida on June 20, 2003. [6] [15] It applied to the United States Patent and Trademark Office to trademark Wikipedia on September 17, 2004. The mark was granted registration status on January 10, 2006. Trademark protection was accorded by Japan on December 16, 2004, and, in the European Union , on January 20, 2005. There were plans to license the use of the Wikipedia trademark for some products, such as books or DVDs. [16]
In April 2005, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service approved the foundation as an educational foundation in the category " Adult , Continuing education ", meaning all contributions to the foundation are tax-deductible for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
On December 11, 2006, the Foundation's board noted that the corporation could not become the membership organization initially planned but never implemented due to an inability to meet the registration requirements of Florida statutory law. Accordingly, [ according to whom? ] the by-laws were amended to remove all reference to membership rights and activities. The decision to change the bylaws was passed by the board unanimously. [17]
On September 25, 2007, the foundation's board gave notice that the operations would be moving to the San Francisco Bay Area . Major considerations cited for choosing San Francisco were proximity to like-minded organizations and potential partners, a better talent pool, as well as cheaper and more convenient international travel than is available from St. Petersburg, Florida . [18] [19] [20]
Lila Tretikov was appointed executive director of the Wikimedia Foundation in May 2014. She resigned in March 2016. Former chief communications officer Katherine Maher was appointed the interim executive director, a position made permanent in June 2016.

Projects and initiatives

 Wikimedia projects
In addition to Wikipedia, the foundation operates other wikis that follow the free content model with their main goal being the dissemination of knowledge. These include:
Several additional projects exist to provide infrastructure or coordination of the free knowledge projects. For instance, a wiki helps coordinate work on MediaWiki software and Outreach gives guidelines for best practices on encouraging the use of Wikimedia sites.

Movement affiliates
Wikimedia movement affiliates are independent, but formally recognized, groups of people intended to work together to support and contribute to the Wikimedia movement. The Wikimedia Foundation's Board of Trustees has approved three active models for movement affiliates: chapters, thematic organizations, and user groups. Movement affiliates are intended to organize and engage in activities to support and contribute to the Wikimedia movement, such as regional conferences, outreach, edit-a-thons , hackathons , public relations , public policy advocacy, GLAM engagement, and Wikimania . [21] [22] [23]
Recognition of a chapter and thematic organization is approved by the foundation's board. Recommendations on recognition of chapters and thematic organizations are made to the foundation's board by an Affiliations Committee , composed of Wikimedia community volunteers. The Affiliations Committee approves the recognition of individual user groups. While movement affiliates are formally recognized by the Wikimedia Foundation, they are independent of the Wikimedia Foundation, with no legal control of nor responsibility for the Wikimedia projects. [22] [23] [24]
The foundation began recognizing chapters in 2004. [25] In 2010, development on additional models began. In 2012, the foundation approved, finalized, and adopted the thematic organization and user group recognition models. An additional model, movement partners, was also approved but as of 27 October 2015 [update] has not yet been finalized or adopted. [21] [23] [26]

Wikimania
Each year, an international conference called Wikimania brings the people together who are involved in the Wikimedia organizations and projects. The first Wikimania was held in Frankfurt , Germany, in 2005. Nowadays, Wikimania is organized by a committee supported usually by the national chapter, in collaboration with the Wikimedia Foundation. Wikimania has been held in cities such as Buenos Aires , [27] Cambridge , [28] Haifa , [29] Hong Kong , [30] and London . [31] In 2015, Wikimania took place in Mexico City . [32] In 2016, Wikimania was held in Esino Lario , Italy . [33]

Strategic plan
In response to the growing size and popularity of Wikipedia, the Wikimedia Foundation announced a Strategic Plan to improve and sustain the Wikimedia movement. The plan was announced in July 2009, followed by a process of interviews and surveys with people from across the Wikimedia movement, including board of trustees, members of staff and volunteer editors. [34] The ongoing plan was intended to be the basis of a five-year plan to further outreach, improve content quality and quality control, and optimising operational areas such as finance and infrastructure. [35]

Wikipedia Usability Initiative
In December 2008, the Wikimedia Foundation announced a restricted donation grant of US$890,000 from the Stanton Foundation , to improve Wikipedia's accessibility. [36] Later named the Wikipedia Usability Initiative, the grant was used by the Wikimedia Foundation to appoint project-specific staff to the technology department. [37]
A series of surveys were conducted throughout 2009. This began with a qualitative environment survey on MediaWiki extensions, followed by a Qualitative Statistical Survey focusing on volume of edits, number of new users, and related statistics. In March 2009, a usability and experience study was carried out on new and non-editors of the English Wikipedia. The aim was to discover what obstacles participants encountered while editing Wikipedia, ranging from small changes to more complicated syntax such as templates. The study recruited 2500 people for in-person laboratory testing via the Wikipedia website, which was filtered down to ten participants. The results were collated and used by the technology team to improve Wikipedia's usability. [38] The Usability and Experience Study was followed up by the Usability, Experience and Progress Study in September 2009. This study recruited different new and non-editors for in-person trials on a new Wikipedia skin. [39]
The initiative ultimately culminated in a new Wikipedia skin named Vector, constructed based on the results of the usability studies. This was introduced by default in stages, beginning in May 2010. [40]

Public Policy Initiative
In May 2010, the Wikimedia Foundation announced the Public Policy Initiative, following a US$1.2 million donation by the Stanton Foundation. The Initiative was set up to improve articles relating to public policy–related issues. [41] As part of the initiative, Wikipedia collaborated with ten universities to help students and professors create and maintain articles relating to public policy. [42] Volunteer editors of Wikipedia, known as "ambassadors", provided assistance to students and professors. This was either done on campus sites or online. [43]
In April 2017, the Foundation was one of the founding partners in the Initiative for Open Citations . [44]

Technology
The foundation employs technology including hardware and software to run its projects.

Hardware
Wikipedia employed a single server until 2004, when the server setup was expanded into a distributed multitier architecture . [45]
In January 2005, the project ran on 39 dedicated servers in Florida. [ citation needed ] This configuration included a single master database server running MySQL , multiple database servers, 21 web servers running the Apache HTTP Server , and seven Squid cache servers. [ citation needed ]
Wikimedia currently runs on dedicated clusters of Linux servers (mainly Ubuntu ). [46] [47] As of December 2009 [update] , there were 300 in Florida and 44 in Amsterdam . [48] The number of servers needed to run the infrastructure has been mostly stable since then: 520 servers are used in the main cluster (eqiad) as of November 2015. [49]
As of 2015, the system still runs on central master database and application servers, but there are several cache layers with various ever-changing technologies, as well as a multitude of subsystems for DNS resolution, load balancing, metrics, monitoring, other system administration etc. [50]

Softwаrе
The operation of Wikimedia depends on MediaWiki , a custom-made, free and open-source wiki software platform written in PHP and built upon the MySQL database. [51] The software incorporates programming features such as a macro language , variables , a transclusion system for templates , and URL redirection . MediaWiki is licensed under the GNU General Public License and it is used by all Wikimedia projects, as well as many other wiki projects. Originally, Wikipedia ran on UseModWiki written in Perl by Clifford Adams (Phase I), which initially required CamelCase for article hyperlinks; the present double bracket style was incorporated later. Starting in January 2002 (Phase II), Wikipedia began running on a PHP wiki engine with a MySQL database; this software was custom-made for Wikipedia by Magnus Manske . The Phase II software was repeatedly modified to accommodate the exponentially increasing demand. In July 2002 (Phase III), Wikipedia shifted to the third-generation software, MediaWiki, originally written by Lee Daniel Crocker . Several MediaWiki extensions are installed to extend the functionality of MediaWiki software. In April 2005, a Lucene extension [52] [53] was added to MediaWiki's built-in search and Wikipedia switched from MySQL to Lucene for searching. Currently Lucene Search 2.1, [54] which is written in Java and based on Lucene library 2.3, [55] is used. Wikimedia Foundation also uses CiviCRM [56] and WordPress . [57]
The Foundation published official Wikipedia mobile apps for Android and iOS devices and in March 2015, the apps were updated to include mobile user friendly features. [58]

Finances

In general
The Wikimedia Foundation relies on public contributions and grants to fund its mission. [59] It is exempt from federal income tax [59] [60] and from state income tax. [59] [61] It is not a private foundation, and contributions to it qualify as tax-deductible charitable contributions. [59]
The continued technical and economic growth of each of the Wikimedia projects is dependent mostly on donations but the Wikimedia Foundation also increases its revenue by alternative means of funding such as grants , sponsorship, services and brand merchandising. The Wikimedia OAI-PMH update feed service, targeted primarily at search engines and similar bulk analysis and republishing, has been a source of revenue for several years, [59] but is no longer open to new customers. [62] DBpedia was given access to this feed free of charge. [63] In July 2014, the Foundation announced it would be accepting Bitcoin donations. [64]
Since the end of fiscal year ended 2004, the Foundation's net assets have grown from US$57,000 [65] to US$53.5 million at the end of fiscal year ended June 30, 2014. [66] Under the leadership of Sue Gardner, who joined the Wikimedia Foundation in 2007, the Foundation's staff levels, number of donors and revenue have seen very significant growth. [67]
In 2007, Charity Navigator gave Wikimedia an overall rating of three out of four possible stars [68] Charity Navigator gave three out of four possible stars in overall rating for fiscal years 2008 and 2009 which improved to four-stars in 2010. [69] As of December 2016, the current overall rating was four stars. [70]

Grants
In March 2008, the Foundation announced a large donation, at the time its largest donation yet: a three-year, US$3 million grant from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation . [71]
In 2009, the Foundation received four grants – the first grant was a US$890,000 Stanton Foundation grant which was aimed to help study and simplify user interface for first-time authors of Wikipedia. [72] The second was a US$300,000 Ford Foundation Grant, given in July 2009, for Wikimedia Commons that aimed to improve the interfaces and workflows for multimedia uploading on Wikimedia websites. [73] In August 2009, the Foundation received a US$500,000 grant from The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation . [74] Lastly, in August 2009, the Omidyar Network issued a potential [ clarification needed ] US$2 million in "grant" funding to Wikimedia. [75]
In 2010, the Google corporation donated US$2 million to the Foundation. [76] The Stanton Foundation granted $1.2 million to fund the Public Policy Initiative, a pilot program for what would later become the Wikipedia Education Program (and the spinoff Wiki Education Foundation ). [77] [78] [79] Also in 2010, the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation pledged a US$800,000 grant and all was funded during 2011. [ citation needed ]
In March 2011, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation authorized another US$3 million grant to continue to develop and maintain the Foundation's mission. The grant was to be funded over three years with the first US$1 million funded in July 2011 and the remaining US$2 million was scheduled to be funded in August 2012 and 2013. In August 2011, the Stanton Foundation pledged to fund a US$3.6 million grant of which US$1.8 million was funded and the remaining was due to be funded in September 2012. As of 2011, this was the largest grant received by the Wikimedia Foundation to-date. [80] In November 2011, the Foundation received a US$500,000 donation from Google co-founder Sergey Brin and his wife. [81] [82]
In 2012, the Foundation was awarded a grant of US$1.25 million from the historians Lisbet Rausing [81] and Peter Baldwin through Charities Aid Foundation , scheduled to be funded in five equal installments. The first installment of US$250,000 was received in April 2012 and the remaining were to be funded in December 2012 through 2015. In 2014, the Foundation received the largest single gift in its history, a $5 million unrestricted donation from an anonymous donor supporting $1 million worth of expenses annually for the next five years. [83]
In 2015, a grant agreement was reached with the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation to build a search engine called the " Knowledge Engine ". [84] [85]

Financial summary

Governance

Board of Trustees
The Board of Trustees has ultimate authority of all the businesses and affairs of the Foundation. It is composed of ten members:
Three permanent entities support the board on its mission and responsibilities: an executive director, who leads and oversees the operational arm of the foundation; an advisory board composed of individuals selected by the board itself that advise the board on different matters; and standing committees to which the board delegates certain matters while retaining ultimate authority. The board has also at times created other orthodox entities [ clarification needed ] to support itself, such as executive secretaries and ad-hoc committees established for specific tasks.
The current board comprises Christophe Henner as chairman and María Sefidari as vice-chairman, together with Alice Wiegand, Nataliia Tymkiv, Kelly Battles , Dariusz Jemielniak as members at-large, and Jimmy Wales as founder's seat (installed as "Community Founder Trustee Position" to the WMF bylaws in August 2008). [95] [96] There are three vacant seats, most recently occupied by Arnnon Geshuri , Denny Vrandečić and Guy Kawasaki .
In a high-profile decision of 2015, James Heilman was removed from the board, [97] [98] with little explanation. [97] In January 2016, Arnnon Geshuri stepped down from the board following a controversy about an agreement he executed when at Google , violating United States antitrust law . The participating companies paid US$415 million in a class action suit on behalf of affected employees. [99] [100]

Advisory board
The Advisory Board, according to the Wikimedia Foundation, is an international network of experts who have agreed to give the foundation meaningful help on a regular basis in many different areas, including law, organizational development, technology, policy, and outreach. [101]

Staff

First appointments
In 2004, the foundation appointed Tim Starling as developer liaison to help improve the MediaWiki software, Daniel Mayer as chief financial officer ( finance , budgeting , and coordination of fund drives), and Erik Möller as content partnership coordinator. In May 2005, the foundation announced seven more official appointments. [102]
In January 2006, the foundation created several committees, including the Communication Committee, in an attempt to further organize activities essentially handled by volunteers at that time. [103] Starling resigned that month to spend more time on his PhD program.

Employees
The foundation's functions were, for the first few years, executed almost entirely by volunteers. In 2005, it had only two employees, Danny Wool, a coordinator, and Brion Vibber, a software manager.
As of October 4, 2006 [update] , the foundation had five paid employees: [104] two programmers, an administrative assistant, a coordinator handling fundraising and grants, and an interim executive director , [105] Brad Patrick, previously the foundation's general counsel . Patrick ceased his activity as interim director in January 2007, and then resigned from his position as legal counsel, effective April 1, 2007. He was replaced by Mike Godwin , who served as general counsel and legal coordinator from July 2007 [106] until 2010.
In January 2007, Carolyn Doran was named chief operating officer and Sandy Ordonez joined as head of communications . [107] Doran began working as a part-time bookkeeper in 2006 after being sent by a temporary agency . Doran, found to have had a long criminal record, [108] left the foundation in July 2007, and Sue Gardner was hired as consultant and special advisor (later CEO). Doran's departure from the organization was cited by Florence Devouard as one of the reasons the foundation took about seven months to release its fiscal 2007 financial audit. [109]
Danny Wool, officially the grant coordinator but also largely involved in fundraising and business development, resigned in March 2007. He accused Wales of misusing the foundation's funds for recreational purposes, and said that Wales had his Wikimedia credit card taken away in part because of his spending habits, a claim Wales denied. [110] In February 2007, the foundation added a new position, chapters coordinator, and hired Delphine Ménard, [111] who had been occupying the position as a volunteer since August 2005. Cary Bass was hired in March 2007 in the position of volunteer coordinator. Oleta McHenry was brought in as accountant in May 2007, through a temporary placement agency and made the official full-time accountant in August 2007. In January 2008, the foundation appointed Veronique Kessler as the new chief financial and operating officer, Kul Wadhwa as head of business development, and Jay Walsh as head of communications.
By early 2015, the foundation had well over 200 employees.

Disputes and lawsuits
Many disputes have resulted in litigation [112] [113] [114] [115] while others have not. [116] Attorney Matt Zimmerman stated, "Without strong liability protection, it would be difficult for Wikipedia to continue to provide a platform for user-created encyclopedia content." [117]
In December 2011, the Foundation hired Washington, DC lobbyist Dow Lohnes Government Strategies LLC to lobby the United States Congress with regard to "Civil Rights/Civil Liberties" and "Copyright/Patent/Trademark." [118] At the time of the hire the Foundation was concerned specifically about a bill known as the Stop Online Piracy Act . [119]
In October 2013, a German Court ruled that the Wikimedia Foundation can be held liable for content added to Wikipedia – however, this applies only when there has been a specific complaint; otherwise, the Wikimedia Foundation does not check any of the content published on Wikipedia and has no duty to do so. [120]
In June 2014, a copyright infringement lawsuit was filed by Bildkonst Upphovsrätt i Sverige against Wikimedia Sweden. [121]
On June 20, 2014, a defamation lawsuit (Law Division civil case No. L-1400-14) involving Wikipedia editors was filed with the Mercer County Superior Court in New Jersey seeking, inter alia, compensatory and punitive damages. [122] [123]
In a March 10, 2015, op-ed for The New York Times , Wales and Tretikov announced the Foundation was filing a lawsuit against the National Security Agency , calling into question its practice of mass surveillance , which they argued infringed the constitutional rights of the Foundation's readers, editors and staff. [124] [125] [126] On October 23, 2015, the United States District Court for the District of Maryland dismissed the suit Wikimedia Foundation v. NSA on grounds of standing . US District Judge T. S. Ellis III ruled that the plaintiffs could not plausibly prove they were subject to upstream surveillance , and that their argument is riddled with assumptions, speculations and mathematical gymnastics. [127] [128] The plaintiffs filed an appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit on February 17, 2016. [129]
In February 2016, Lila Tretikov announced her resignation as executive director, as a result of the WMF's controversial Knowledge Engine project and disagreements with the staff. [130] [131]

Marshall Poe
Marshall Tillbrook Poe (born December 29, 1961) is an American historian, writer, editor and founder of the New Books Network, an online collection of podcast interviews with a wide range of non-fiction authors. [1] [2] He has taught Russian, European, Eurasian and World history at various universities including Harvard , Columbia , University of Iowa , and, currently, the University of Massachusetts Amherst . He has also taught courses on new media and online collaboration . [3]
Poe is the author or editor of a number of books on early modern Russia . He has also published A History of Communications: Media and Society from the Evolution of Speech to the Internet , a book that examines how various communications media shape social practices and values. [1]
In 2005, Poe founded the now-defunct MemoryArchive , a universal wiki -type archive of contemporary memoirs. It encouraged people to contribute written accounts of their personal memories that would be part of a searchable, online database . [4] There he contributed numerous personal accounts of his own, from playing basketball with Barack Obama , [5] to stumbling onto a crime scene of Dennis Rader's , the BTK serial killer .
In 2006, Poe wrote an influential commentary on Wikipedia , the online encyclopedia, while serving as a writer, researcher and editor at the The Atlantic magazine. [1] [6]

Education and academic career
Marshall Poe was born in Huntsville, Alabama on December 29, 1961. His early schooling was hampered by what he has called "pretty severe dyslexia ." As a result, he did not learn to read until the second or third grade in primary school . [7]
Poe graduated from Wichita Southeast High School in 1980 and earned his B.A. in 1984 at Grinnell College where he was named outstanding student in history. He earned his M.A. from the University of California, Berkeley , in 1986 and his Ph.D in history at Berkeley in 1992. [3]
He taught at Harvard University from 1989 to 1996 and again from 1999 to 2002, during which time he was appointed Allston Burr Senior Tutor at Harvard's Lowell House where he managed a college of 600 undergraduate students and 50 tutors and staff. He also taught at New York University (1999), American University (2005), the University of Iowa (2007-2013) and the University of Massachusetts Amherst (2013-2014). [3]
He has held fellowships at the Davis Center for Russian Studies at Harvard; the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey ; and the Harriman Institute for Russian Studies at Columbia University . [1]
At the Institute for Advanced Study, Poe played guitar and sang in a loud rock and roll band called "Do Not Erase," consisting entirely of fellows at the Institute. The name of the band is taken from what mathematicians write under their long theorems and proofs on chalk boards, so that janitors won't erase them, especially if their equations have discovered something new. [8]

Writing
Marshall Poe's writing ranges from academic articles and books to magazine and Internet pieces intended for wider audiences. He has written extensively on Russian history as well on communications, the Internet and Wikipedia.

Russian history
Poe is the co-founder and a former editor of the academic journal Kritika : Explorations in Russian and Eurasian History. He is the author or editor of several books on Russia including A People Born to Slavery: Russia in Early Modern European Ethnography (2000) and The Russian Elite in the Seventeenth Century (2004). [1] The Russian Moment in World History (2006) is a brief, 116 page book that was written for the general public. It provides an overview of more than 1,400 years of Russian history beginning in the 6th to 9th centuries with the migration of Slavs from central Europe to the northeast. It ends with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. [9]
Poe argues the Soviet Union did not collapse because of the failure of Communism as many pundits assert. Rather, he contends that the Communist Party lost faith in the traditional path that had not only preserved Russian independence for almost five centuries, but had also enabled the country to build a huge empire . That path included a reliance on autocratic leadership , a command economy , tight controls on debate in the public sphere and a state-engineered military. "Using these means," Poe writes, "the Russian elite was able to take a primitive, premodern state and transform it in the course of two centuries into one of the most powerful enterprises on earth. It is difficult to see how such a thing could be seen as a failure." [9]
Poe's work on Russian history has brought back from obscurity the writings of the 16th-century Austrian diplomat Sigismund von Herberstein , who was one of the first European ethnographers of Russia. [10]

The Atlantic
From 2003 to 2005, Poe conducted research for The Atlantic magazine and co-wrote the regular feature "Primary Sources.". [3] A typical one, in the magazine's July/August 2005 edition, provided information on a variety of studies and reports supported by online links. For example, it included a study by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences warning about the security risks posed by pools of spent fuel from nuclear power plants ; a report from a Brussels -based think tank noting that in spite of fears expressed by U.S. officials, Iran did not appear to be much of a threat to Iraq and a report from the Pew Hispanic Centre showing that increased security measures since 9/11 had not stopped the flow of illegal immigrants into the U.S. [11]
Poe has also written a number of articles for The Atlantic including "Life on Mars" (2004); [12] "How to Beat a Drug Test" (2005); [13] and "Colleges Should Teach Religion to Their Students" (2014). [14]

Wikipedia: Common Knowledge
Poe became known for his commentary on Wikipedia following the publication of his article "The Hive" in The Atlantic . [15] With Wikipedia "taking off" in 2005, he thought its history could be interesting, so he wrote the piece on "spec." His gamble paid off when the editors published it in the summer of 2006. [16]
Poe's article traces the history of how the co-founders of Wikipedia, Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger , gradually moved from their original idea for an online encyclopedia called Nupedia , written and edited by experts, to one in which any online user could contribute. He concludes that Wikipedia's "communal regime" permitted rapid growth as well as organization and improvement. "The result of this difference is there for all to see," he writes, "much of the Internet is a chaotic mess and therefore useless, whereas Wikipedia is well ordered and hence very useful." [15]
Poe's position on Wikipedia is that it's not an encyclopedia that imparts expert knowledge, but a repository of common knowledge . During an interview with Andrew Keen , he argued that through a collaborative group, great things can be accomplished. "Wikipedia is in a sense kind of public utility now. It's much more like the electric company or the water company or the public library than it is anything else and there's no reason it shouldn't exist and continue to expand alongside all kinds of other commercial ventures because it is basically built for free. I mean it's just — it's a utility that is provided to the public at almost no public cost." [17]

Communications: Pull and Push
In 2011, Poe published A History of Communications: Media and Society from the Evolution of Speech to the Internet , a 337-page book that analyzes how media networks originate, how they function and how they shape social practices and values. [1] Poe explains in the book's introduction that he is seeking to expand and refine the communications theories of the late Canadian scholar Harold Innis . In his 1950 book Empire and Communications , Innis conducted a sweeping historical survey of how various media influenced the rise and fall of empires from ancient to modern times. [18]
Poe advances the idea that new media are developed by inventors and tinkerers, but are not "pulled" into broad use until "organized interests" recognize their need for these new communications tools. He argues, for example, that audiovisual media such as radio, telephone, television and film were developed well before they were taken up by industrial capitalists who needed more effective ways to market the goods they produced. Audiovisual media also served the interests of bureaucrats and politicians who gained popularity by giving citizens access to modern conveniences. "Modern states are welfare states ," Poe writes, "and welfare states make sure their citizens have things to listen to and watch."
In turn, audiovisual media shaped social practices and values. They "pushed" societies into a hedonistic pursuit of private entertainment justified by people's need for relaxation in an otherwise stressful society. And, since evolutionary psychology suggests that human beings find it easier to listen and watch than to read and write, audiovisual media caught on rapidly. "When faced with reading a good book," Poe writes, "or watching an awful TV show, most people will watch the awful TV show." [1]
Poe writes about five periods in media history: the age of speech , the age of manuscripts , the age of print , the age of audiovisual media and the age of the Internet . He provides a detailed analysis of each under eight headings: accessibility , privacy , fidelity , volume , velocity , range , persistence and searchability . Poe writes, for example, that in the 150,000 years during which speech was the only medium or network, its accessibility was high because nearly everyone could speak and listen. Privacy, however, was low in such face-to-face communication and so too was fidelity because speech can convey only sounds, not pictures or other direct sensory information. Volume and range were also low because the unaided human voice can't carry very far or to many people, but velocity was high because speech travels at the speed of sound. Poe notes that speech is not a persistent medium because it fades away instantly, but it is searchable because what is said can remain in people's memories. He draws many conclusions from this analysis including his theory that societies dominated by speech tended to be democratized and egalitarian , but also distrustful of strangers because as a medium, speech is suited to small, tightly knit groups. [1]

New publishing model
In his 2002 essay "Note to Self: Print Monograph Dead; Invent New Publishing Model," published in the Journal of Electronic Publishing , Poe questioned the viability of the old academic publishing model, arguing in favor of self-publishing and print on demand . He explained how he did this with one of the two volumes of his prosopographical study of the Russian elite in the early modern period. "Shortly after I sent the book for review", he writes, "a very worried journal editor contacted me. He was upset that I hadn't included a copyright page on the e-book I sent him. Without a copyright page, he explained, any reader could copy my book, send it all over the world, or use it in the classroom — all without my permission. That, I responded, was the point. (I'm not sure he got it.)" [19]

New Books Network
In 2013, Marshall Poe took a leave of absence from his teaching job at the University of Iowa to work full-time on the New Books Network which he founded. [7] The network describes itself as "a consortium of podcasts dedicated to raising the level of public discourse by introducing serious authors to serious audiences." [20] At first, Poe himself interviewed the authors of new non-fiction books for the website that was then called New Books in History . But the site now has many channels devoted to new books on subjects ranging from African-American studies and economics to philosophy and sports . [21] Poe invites volunteers who are knowledgeable about a subject to conduct "radio interviews" with authors of new books in that subject area. "It's premised on the idea that while most people won't read serious books, they might listen to the authors of those books talk about the ideas in them," Poe told an interviewer. "Reading is hard and inconvenient; listening is easy and convenient. We interview authors with new books, make 'radio shows' out of them, and distribute them on the web as podcasts." Poe added that he would be seeking investors, soliciting donations and looking for business partnerships to pay his salary. [22]

DMOZ
DMOZ (from directory.mozilla.org , an earlier domain name ) was a multilingual open-content directory of World Wide Web links. The site and community who maintained it were also known as the Open Directory Project ( ODP ). It was owned by AOL but constructed and maintained by a community of volunteer editors.
DMOZ used a hierarchical ontology scheme for organizing site listings. Listings on a similar topic were grouped into categories which then included smaller categories.
DMOZ closed on March 17, 2017 due to AOL no longer wishing to support the project. [2] [3] The website became a single landing page on that day, with links to a static archive of DMOZ, and to the DMOZ discussion forum, where plans to rebrand and relaunch the directory are being discussed. [3]

History
DMOZ was founded in the United States as Gnuhoo by Rich Skrenta and Bob Truel in 1998 while they were both working as engineers for Sun Microsystems . Chris Tolles, who worked at Sun Microsystems as the head of marketing for network security products, also signed on in 1998 as a co-founder of Gnuhoo along with co-founders Bryn Dole and Jeremy Wenokur. Skrenta had developed TASS , an ancestor of tin , the popular threaded Usenet newsreader for Unix systems. The original category structure of the Gnuhoo directory was based loosely on the structure of Usenet newsgroups then in existence.
The Gnuhoo directory went live on June 5, 1998. After a Slashdot article suggested that Gnuhoo had nothing in common with the spirit of free software , [4] for which the GNU project was known, Richard Stallman and the Free Software Foundation objected to the use of "Gnu" in the name and Gnuhoo was changed to NewHoo. Yahoo! then objected to the use of "Hoo" in the name, prompting a proposed name change, to ZURL. [5] Prior to switching to ZURL, NewHoo was acquired by Netscape Communications Corporation in October 1998 and became the Open Directory Project. Netscape released Open Directory data under the Open Directory License . Netscape was acquired by AOL shortly thereafter and DMOZ was one of the assets included in the acquisition.
By the time Netscape assumed stewardship, the Open Directory Project had about 100,000 URLs indexed with contributions from about 4500 editors. On October 5, 1999, the number of URLs indexed by DMOZ reached one million. According to an unofficial estimate, the URLs in DMOZ numbered 1.6 million in April 2000, surpassing those in the Yahoo! Directory . [6] DMOZ achieved the milestones of indexing two million URLs on August 14, 2000, three million listings on November 18, 2001 and four million on December 3, 2003. As of April, 2013 there were 5,169,995 sites listed in over 1,017,500 categories. On October 31, 2015, there were 3,996,412 sites listed in 1,026,706 categories.
In January 2006, DMOZ began publishing online reports to inform the public about the development of the project. The first report covered the year 2005. Monthly reports were issued subsequently until September 2006. [7] These reports gave greater insight into the functioning of the directory than the simplified statistics provided on the front page of the directory. The number of listings and categories cited on the front page included "Test" and "Bookmarks" categories but these were not included in the RDF dump offered to users. There were about 7330 active editors during August 2006. [7] 75,151 editors had contributed to the directory as of March 31, 2007. [8] As of April 2013, the number of contributing editors had increased to 97,584. [9]

System failure and editing outage, October to December 2006
On October 20, 2006, DMOZ's main server suffered a catastrophic failure [10] that prevented editors from working on the directory until December 18, 2006. During that period, an older build of the directory was visible to the public. On January 13, 2007, the Site Suggestion and Update Listings forms were again made available. [11] On January 26, 2007, weekly publication of RDF dumps resumed. To avoid future outages, the system resided on a redundant configuration of two Intel-based servers from then on. [12]
The site's interface was given an upgrade in 2016, branded "DMOZ 3.0" but AOL took it offline the following year.

Competing and spinoff projects
As DMOZ became more widely known, two other major web directories edited by volunteers and sponsored by Go.com and Zeal emerged, both now defunct. These directories did not license their content for open content distribution. [13] [14]
The concept of using a large-scale community of editors to compile online content has been successfully applied to other types of projects. DMOZ's editing model directly inspired at least three other open content volunteer projects: music site MusicMoz, an open content restaurant directory known as ChefMoz [15] and an encyclopedia known as Open Site . [16] Finally, according to Larry Sanger , DMOZ was part of the inspiration for the Nupedia project, out of which Wikipedia grew. [17]

Logotypes

Content
Gnuhoo borrowed the basic outline for its initial ontology from Usenet . In 1998, Rich Skrenta said, "I took a long list of groups and hand-edited them into a hierarchy." [18] For example, the topic covered by the comp.ai.alife newsgroup was represented by the category Computers/AI/Artificial_Life. The original divisions were for Adult , Arts , Business , Computers , Games , Health , Home , News , Recreation , Reference , Regional , Science , Shopping , Society , Sports and "World". While these sixteen top-level categories have remained intact, the ontology of second- and lower-level categories has undergone a gradual evolution; significant changes are initiated by discussion among editors and then implemented when consensus has been reached.
In July 1998, the directory became multilingual with the addition of the World top-level category. The remainder of the directory lists only English language sites. By May 2005, seventy-five languages were represented. The growth rate of the non-English components of the directory has been greater than the English component since 2002. While the English component of the directory held almost 75% of the sites in 2003, the World level grew to over 1.5 million sites as of May 2005, forming roughly one-third of the directory. The ontology in non-English categories generally mirrors that of the English directory, although exceptions which reflect language differences are quite common.
Several of the top-level categories have unique characteristics. The Adult category is not present on the directory homepage but it is fully available in the RDF dump that DMOZ provides. While the bulk of the directory is categorized primarily by topic, the Regional category is categorized primarily by region. This has led many to view DMOZ as two parallel directories: Regional and Topical .
On November 14, 2000, a special directory within DMOZ was created for people under 18 years of age. [19] Key factors distinguishing this "Kids and Teens" area from the main directory are:
By May 2005, this portion of DMOZ included over 32,000 site listings.
Since early 2004, the whole site has been in UTF-8 encoding. Prior to this, the encoding used to be ISO 8859-1 for English language categories and a language-dependent character set for other languages. The RDF dumps have been encoded in UTF-8 since early 2000.

Maintenance
Directory listings are maintained by editors. While some editors focus on the addition of new listings, others focus on maintaining the existing listings and some do both. This includes tasks such as the editing of individual listings to correct spelling and/or grammatical errors, as well as monitoring the status of linked sites. Still others go through site submissions to remove spam and duplicate submissions.
Robozilla is a Web crawler written to check the status of all sites listed in DMOZ. Periodically, Robozilla will flag sites which appear to have moved or disappeared and editors follow up to check the sites and take action. This process is critical for the directory in striving to achieve one of its founding goals: to reduce the link rot in web directories. Shortly after each run, the sites marked with errors are automatically moved to the unreviewed queue where editors may investigate them when time permits.
Due to the popularity of DMOZ and its resulting impact on search engine rankings (See PageRank ), domains with lapsed registration that are listed on DMOZ have attracted domain hijacking , an issue that has been addressed by regularly removing expired domains from the directory.
While corporate funding and staff for DMOZ have diminished in recent years, volunteers have created editing tools such as linkcheckers to supplement Robozilla, category crawlers, spellcheckers, search tools that directly sift a recent RDF dump, bookmarklets to help automate some editing functions, mozilla based add-ons, [21] and tools to help work through unreviewed queues.

License and requirements
DMOZ data was previously made available under the terms of the Open Directory License , which required a specific DMOZ attribution table on every Web page that uses the data.
The Open Directory License also included a requirement that users of the data continually check DMOZ site for updates and discontinue use and distribution of the data or works derived from the data once an update occurs. This restriction prompted the Free Software Foundation to refer to the Open Directory License as a non-free documentation license, citing the right to redistribute a given version not being permanent and the requirement to check for changes to the license.
In 2011, DMOZ silently changed its license to a Creative Commons Attribution license [ citation needed ] , which is compatible with the FSF. [22]

RDF dumps
DMOZ data is made available through an RDF-like dump that is published on a download server, older versions are also archived there. [23] New versions are usually generated weekly. An DMOZ editor has catalogued a number of bugs that are encountered in the DMOZ RDF dump, most importantly that the file format isn't RDF. [24] So while today the so-called RDF dump is valid XML , it is not valid RDF and as such, software to process the DMOZ RDF dump needs to be specifically written for DMOZ data.

Content users
DMOZ data powers the core directory services for many of the Web's largest search engines and portals, including Netscape Search, AOL Search, and Alexa . Google Directory used DMOZ information, until being shuttered in July 2011. [25]
Other uses are also made of DMOZ data. For example, in the spring of 2004 Overture announced a search service for third parties combining Yahoo! Directory search results with DMOZ titles, descriptions and category metadata. The search engine Gigablast announced on May 12, 2005 its searchable copy of DMOZ. The technology permits search of websites listed in specific categories, "in effect, instantly creating over 500,000 vertical search engines". [26]
As of 8 September 2006 [update] , DMOZ listed 313 English-language Web sites that use DMOZ data as well as 238 sites in other languages. [27] However, these figures do not reflect the full picture of use, as those sites that use DMOZ data without following the terms of the DMOZ license are not listed.

Policies and procedures
Restrictions are imposed on who can become an DMOZ editor. The primary gatekeeping mechanism is an editor application process wherein editor candidates demonstrate their editing abilities, disclose affiliations that might pose a conflict of interest , and otherwise give a sense of how the applicant would likely mesh with the DMOZ culture and mission. [28] A majority of applications are rejected but reapplying is allowed and sometimes encouraged. The same standards apply to editors of all categories and subcategories. [ citation needed ]
DMOZ's editing model is a hierarchical one. Upon becoming editors, individuals will generally have editing permissions in only a small category. Once they have demonstrated basic editing skills in compliance with the Editing Guidelines, they are welcome to apply for additional editing privileges in either a broader category or else another category in the directory. Mentorship relationships between editors are encouraged, and internal forums provide a vehicle for new editors to ask questions. [ citation needed ]
DMOZ has its own internal forums, the contents of which are intended only for editors to communicate with each other primarily about editing topics. Access to the forums requires an editor account and editors are expected to keep the contents of these forums private. [29]
Over time, senior editors can be granted additional privileges which reflect their editing experience and leadership within the editing community. The most straightforward are editall privileges, which allow an editor to access all categories in the directory. Meta privileges additionally allow editors to perform tasks such as reviewing editor applications, setting category features, and handling external and internal abuse reports. Cateditall privileges are similar to editall , but only for a single directory category. Similarly, catmod privileges are similar to meta , but only for a single directory category. Catmv privileges allow editors to make changes to directory ontology by moving or renaming categories. All of these privileges are granted by admins and staff, usually after discussion with meta editors. [ citation needed ]
In August 2004, a new level of privileges called admin was introduced. Administrator status was granted to a number of long serving metas by staff. Administrators have the ability to grant editall+ privileges to other editors and to approve new directory-wide policies, powers which had previously only been available to root (staff) editors. [30]
All DMOZ editors are expected to abide by DMOZ's Editing Guidelines. These guidelines describe editing basics: which types of sites may be listed and which may not; how site listings should be titled and described in a loosely consistent manner; conventions for the naming and building of categories; conflict of interest limitations on the editing of sites which the editor may own or otherwise be affiliated with; and a code of conduct within the community. [31] Editors who are found to have violated these guidelines may be contacted by staff or senior editors, have their editing permissions cut back, or lose their editing privileges entirely. DMOZ Guidelines are periodically revised after discussion in editor forums. [ citation needed ]

Controversy and criticism
There have long been allegations that volunteer DMOZ editors give favorable treatment to their own websites while concomitantly thwarting the good faith efforts of their competition. [32] Such allegations are fielded by ODP's staff and meta editors, who have the authority to take disciplinary action against volunteer editors who are suspected of engaging in abusive editing practices. [33] In 2003, DMOZ introduced a new Public Abuse Report System that allows members of the general public to report and track allegations of abusive editor conduct using an online form. [34] Uninhibited discussion of DMOZ's purported shortcomings has become more common on mainstream Webmaster discussion forums. Although site policies suggest that an individual site should be submitted to only one category, [35] as of October 2007, Topix.com, a news aggregation site operated by DMOZ founder Rich Skrenta, has more than 17,000 listings. [36]
Early in the history of DMOZ, its staff gave representatives of selected companies, such as Rolling Stone or CNN , editing access in order to list individual pages from their websites. [37] Links to individual CNN articles were added until 2004, but were entirely removed from the directory in January 2008 [38] due to the content being outdated and not considered worth the effort to maintain. There have been no similar experiments with the editing policy since then.

Ownership and management
Underlying some controversy surrounding DMOZ is its ownership and management. Some of the original GnuHoo volunteers felt that they had been deceived into joining a commercial enterprise. [4] To varying degrees, those complaints have continued up until the present.
At DMOZ's inception, there was little thought given to the idea of how DMOZ should be managed and there were no official forums , guidelines or FAQs . In essence, DMOZ began as a free for all. [39]
As time went on, the ODP Editor Forums became the de facto DMOZ parliament and when one of DMOZ's staff members would post an opinion in the forums, it would be considered an official ruling. [29] Even so, DMOZ staff began to give trusted senior editors additional editing privileges, including the ability to approve new editor applications, which eventually led to a stratified hierarchy of duties and privileges among DMOZ editors, with DMOZ's paid staff having the final say regarding DMOZ's policies and procedures. [30] [40]
Robert Keating, a principal of Touchstone Consulting Group in Washington, D.C. since 2006, has worked as AOL's Program Manager for DMOZ since 2004. He started working for AOL in 1999 as Senior Editor for AOL Search, then as Managing Editor, AOL Search, DMOZ, and then as Media Ecosystem Manager, AOL Product Marketing. [41] [42]

Editor removal procedures
DMOZ's editor removal procedures are overseen by DMOZ's staff and meta editors. According to DMOZ's official editorial guidelines, editors are removed for abusive editing practices or uncivil behaviour. Discussions that may result in disciplinary action against volunteer editors take place in a private forum which can only be accessed by DMOZ's staff and meta editors. Volunteer editors who are being discussed are not given notice that such proceedings are taking place. [40] Some people find this arrangement distasteful, wanting instead a discussion modelled more like a trial held in the U.S. judicial system. [43]
In the article "Editor Removal Explained", DMOZ meta editor Arlarson states that "a great deal of confusion about the removal of editors from DMOZ results from false or misleading statements by former editors". [44]
The DMOZ's confidentiality guidelines prohibit any current DMOZ editors in a position to know anything from discussing the reasons for specific editor removals. [40] However, a generic list of reasons is for example given in the guidelines. [45] In the past, this has led to removed DMOZ editors wondering why they cannot login at DMOZ to perform their editing work. [46] [47]

Allegations that editors are removed for criticizing policies
David F. Prenatt, Jr., former DMOZ editor netesq , and another former editor known by the alias The Cunctator , both claim to have been removed for disagreeing with staff about changes to policies, particularly DMOZ's copyright policies. According to their claims, staff use the excuse of uncivil behaviour as a means to remove bothersome editors. [43] [48] [49]

Blacklisting allegations
Senior DMOZ editors have the ability to attach "warning" or "do not list" notes to individual domains but no editor has the unilateral ability to block certain sites from being listed. Sites with these notes might still be listed and at times notes are removed after some discussion. [50]

Hierarchical structure
Criticism of DMOZ's hierarchical structure emerged by around 2005. Many believe hierarchical directories are too complicated. With the emergence of Web 2.0 , folksonomies began to appear, and some editors proposed that folksonomies, networks and directed graphs are more "natural" and easier to manage than hierarchies. [51] [52] [53]

Software

Search
The ODPSearch software is a derivative version of Isearch which is open source , licensed under the Mozilla Public License . [54]

Editor forums
The ODP Editor Forums were originally run on software that was based on the proprietary Ultimate Bulletin Board system. In June 2003, they switched to the open source phpBB system. As of 2007, these forums are powered by a modified version of phpBB.

Bug tracking
The bug tracking software used by the ODP is Bugzilla and the web server Apache . Squid web proxy server was also used but it was removed in August 2007 when the storage servers were reorganized. All these applications are open source.

Interface
The DMOZ database/editing software is closed source (although Richard Skrenta has said in June 1998 that he was considering licensing it under the GNU General Public License ). This has led to criticism from the aforementioned GNU project, many of whom also criticized the DMOZ content license. The content was later released under a Creative Commons license, which is compatible with the GNU license. [55]
As such, there have been some efforts to provide alternatives to DMOZ. These alternatives would allow communities of like-minded editors to set up and maintain their own open source/open content Web directories. However, no significant open source/open content alternative to DMOZ has emerged.

The Signpost
The Signpost (formerly The Wikipedia Signpost [2] ) is the English Wikipedia 's newspaper. [3] [4] [5] Managed by the Wikipedia community , it is published online with contributions from Wikipedia editors. [1] The newspaper reports on the Wikipedia community and events related to Wikipedia, including Arbitration Committee rulings, [6] Wikimedia Foundation issues, [7] and other Wikipedia-related projects . [8]
It was founded in January 2005 by Wikipedian Michael Snow. [3] [9] Originally called The Wikipedia Signpost , the newspaper's title was later shortened to The Signpost . [2] [10] Snow continued as a contributor until his February 2008 appointment to the Wikimedia Foundation's Board of Trustees . [11]
Former editor-in-chief, The ed17, noted that during his tenure from 2012 to 2015, the publication expanded its scope to report on the wider Wikimedia movement in addition to Wikipedia and its community. In January 2015, Wikipedia editors Gamaliel and Go Phightins! succeeded The ed17 as editors-in-chief. [12] After reporting on the changes to European freedom of panorama law in June 2015, The Signpost was consulted by a number of publications for further information. [13] [14] [15]
The Signpost has been the subject of academic analysis in Sociological Forum , [16] the social-movements journal Interface , [17] and the New Review of Academic Librarianship , [18] and was consulted for data on Wikipedia by researchers from Los Alamos National Laboratory and Dartmouth College . [19] It has been covered by The New York Times , [20] The Register , [21] Nonprofit Quarterly , [22] and Heise Online . [23] The book Wikipedia: The Missing Manual called The Signpost essential reading for ambitious new Wikipedia editors. [24]

History
The newspaper, first published in January 2005 as The Wikipedia Signpost , was later renamed The Signpost . [2] [10] It was founded by Michael Snow, a Wikipedian and later chair of the Wikimedia Foundation 's Board of Trustees. [2] [9] Similar efforts had been made with Wikipedia:Announcements by Larry Sanger on November 20, 2001, [25] [26] Wikimedia News on Meta-Wiki November 14, 2002, [27] and Wikipedia-Kurier in the German Wikipedia on December 10, 2003. [28]
Snow wrote in its first issue: "I hope this will be a worthwhile source of news for people interested in what is happening around the Wikipedia community", [29] and said that The Signpost 's name was suggested by the Wikipedia practice of editors digitally signing talk-page posts. [29] He stepped down as editor of The Signpost in August 2005, continuing to write for the newspaper until his February 2008 appointment to the Board of Trustees. [11] Ral315 succeeded Snow as editor, writing in his first post: "I'd like to personally thank Michael for his work on the Signpost ; it was a great idea that really helped Wikipedians learn more about the happenings on Wikipedia." [30] He conducted a survey for The Signpost in September 2007, estimating a weekly readership of approximately 2,800 Wikipedia users based on survey results. [31]
In July 2008, user Ral315 wrote about transparency for The Signpost , acknowledging that at the request of the Wikimedia Foundation, the newspaper had decided not to publish an article about a pending legal case against the foundation. [32] According to the editor, "I feel this was an unfortunate, but necessary, move"; because of the newspaper's affiliation with the Wikimedia Foundation, an article about the lawsuit "might have had a severe effect on the case." [32] Ral315 expressed concern about the future impact of the decision: "I'm still rather troubled by the very nature of this situation, because it was the first time that I've felt pressured by the Wikimedia Foundation not to write or publish a story. This also leaves us with a dangerous precedent that I'm hoping only to keep in the most serious cases." [32]
The Signpost published its 200th issue in November 2008. [33] A total of 1,731 articles had been published, written by 181 contributors. [33] Wikipedia user Ragesoss took over as editor of the newspaper in February 2009, in an issue which featured a new layout. [34] Ragesoss resigned as editor in June 2010, and HaeB took over as the newspaper debated changing its name from The Wikipedia Signpost to The Signpost . [35] That year, sister Wikipedia publications managed by volunteer contributors included The Wikipedia Weekly , a podcast , and The Wikizine , a news bulletin. [36] [37]
HaeB resigned as editor after he was hired by the Wikimedia Foundation in July 2011: "It would make it too much of a conflict of interest if I were to continue to make final editorial decisions for a community-run publication." [38] After three interim editors-in-chief, [39] Wikipedia user The ed17 took over in May 2012 as The Signpost 's eighth editor. [40] He previously edited The Bugle , the publication of the WikiProject dedicated to improving the encyclopedia's military history articles. [40] The International Business Times noted in a 2013 article that The Signpost 's investigative journalism uncovered a link between the Wiki-PR firm and conflict-of-interest editing on Wikipedia . [41]
After its June 2015 reporting on the likelihood of increased copyright restrictions in Europe involving changes to freedom of panorama , [43] The Signpost was consulted for information by publications in several languages, including English, [44] [45] German, [42] Italian, [13] Polish, [14] [46] and Russian. [15]
Wikipedia users Gamaliel and Go Phightins! became editors-in-chief of The Signpost in January 2015. The ed17 noted that during his tenure, the newspaper expanded its scope beyond the English Wikipedia to the wider Wikimedia movement. [12] In a January 2015 tenth-anniversary retrospective, Gamaliel emphasized that further improvements to the newspaper depended on collaboration and involvement by the Wikipedia community and invited users to contribute suggestions and join the editing team. [48] In their first issue of the newspaper as editors-in-chief, Go Phightins! and Gamaliel wrote about the unique role of The Signpost : "We will strive to maintain our voice and standing as an independent entity, separate from the WMF, Wikimedia chapters, WikiEd, or other entities." [49]
In January 2016, Fortune and Ars Technica relied on The Signpost in reporting a vote of no confidence by Wikipedia editors against Arnnon Geshuri joining the Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees. [50] [51] While reporting in February 2016 about controversy and confusion at the Wikimedia Foundation concerning executive director Lila Tretikov remaining in her position, The Signpost illustrated its article with a photo of black smoke emanating from a chimney in reference to the papal conclave used to select a pope . [47] According to Heise Online , the photo indicated pressure on the board to take action. [47] Andreas Kolbe wrote for The Signpost "that the creation of a successful search engine would transform volunteers into 'unpaid hamsters. ' " [52]

Content
The Signpost publishes stories relating to the Wikipedia community , the Wikimedia Foundation , and other Wikipedia-related projects , [7] [8] [53] [54] and is provided free of charge. [4] [5] The Wikipedia community manages the newspaper, which was announced in July 2016 it will published every two weeks moving forward, due to a shortage of contributors. [1] From 2005 to March 2016, the Signpost has been published on a weekly basis. From April 2016, the nominal periodicity has been changed to " fortnightly ". But, in January and February 2017 only 3 issues were published, [55] and none in March, April or early May. Readers may choose to be notified of a new issue by email or, with a Wikipedia account, on their user talk page. [24]
The newspaper informs Wikipedia editors about ongoing collaborative projects to improve articles on the site, [56] and is a location for centralized notices of recent academic studies about Wikipedia . [10] The Signpost includes an arbitration report, formerly known as "The Report on Lengthy Litigation", which details proceedings by Wikipedia's Arbitration Committee . [6]
The Signpost archives are publicly available, facilitating study of the history of Wikipedia . [3]

Analysis
In a 2009 article in the peer-reviewed academic journal , Sociological Forum , Piotr Konieczny called The Signpost an example of a subcommunity within the larger Wikipedia community. [16] In the social-movements journal Interface that year, Konieczny cited The Signpost as part of the "complexity and richness of those organizations" in which individuals can volunteer their time on the website. [17]
Researchers from Los Alamos National Laboratory and Dartmouth College relied on Signpost archives to track Wikipedia editing outages, presenting their findings at the 2011 IEEEIWIC/ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence. [19] In her 2013 study of Wikipedia and its reputation in higher education in the journal New Review of Academic Librarianship , Gemma Bayliss reviewed the Signpost Twitter feed to confirm the timeliness of her research. [18]

Reception
In 2007 The New York Times called The Signpost a "mocked-up newspaper", with a retro style characteristic of Wikipedia and "its own special brand of kitsch". [20] In his 2008 book, Wikipedia: The Missing Manual , John Broughton recommended The Signpost as essential reading for aspiring Wikipedia contributors: "If you expect to continue editing at Wikipedia for any length of time, by all means subscribe to ... The Wikipedia Signpost ." [24]
Fortune called The Signpost "Wikipedia's insider newspaper". [50] In a 2016 article The Register ' s executive editor, Andrew Orlowski , described The Signpost as "Wikipedia's own plucky newsletter." [21] According to Ars Technica tech-policy editor Joe Mullin, documents were leaked to (and published by) The Signpost about the Knight Foundation 's Knowledge Engine grant for a Wikimedia Foundation search-engine project in February 2016. [57] Writing about the Knowledge Engine controversy, Nonprofit Quarterly editor-in-chief Ruth McCambridge directed technically-minded readers to The Signpost "to better understand what was being planned." [22] In his article for the German magazine Heise Online , Torsten Kleinz wrote: "When official communications ground to a halt, The Signpost ... jumped into the breach, brought unknown facts to light and initiated an informed discussion." [23]

Henryk Batuta hoax
The Henryk Batuta hoax was a hoax perpetrated on the Polish Wikipedia from November 2004 to February 2006, the main element of which was a biographical article about a person who did not exist.

History
The perpetrators of the hoax created an article about Henryk Batuta (born Izaak Apfelbaum ), a fictional socialist revolutionary and Polish Communist . The fake biography said Batuta was born in Odessa in 1898, and participated in the Russian Civil War . The article was created on 8 November 2004 and exposed as a hoax 16 months later when on 1 February 2006, it was listed for deletion. [ citation needed ]
The article was ten sentences long while it existed on Polish Wikipedia. It gained some prominence after stories about it appeared in prominent Polish newspapers ( Gazeta Wyborcza ) and magazines ( Przekrój ), as well as a British one ( The Observer ). [ citation needed ]
The article also falsely claimed a street in Warsaw was named "Henryk Batuta Street", after the fictional communist official. The anonymous hoaxers who created the article, according to the press calling themselves "The Batuta Army" (pl. "Armia Batuty"), allegedly wanted to draw attention to the fact that there are still places in Poland named after former communist officials who "do not deserve the honour". [1]
The hoax was exposed when the article was listed for deletion. Even after the article was exposed as a well-organized hoax, its perpetrators tried to convince others of its authenticity by providing false bibliographical information and even by uploading a doctored photograph of a street name "ulica Henryka Batuty" (Henryk Batuta Street). The mystification was "officially" exposed and confirmed on 9 February 2006, when the Polish daily Gazeta Wyborcza and weekly Przekrój published their articles about the hoax. [ citation needed ]
There is an "ulica Batuty" (Batuta Street) in Warsaw; [2] however, the name comes from the Polish word "batuta", which means " conductor's baton ". In this area of the Służewiec district there are many street names relating to music and this is one of them. [3]

Content of the hoax article
An English translation of the hoax article as it appeared on the Polish Wikipedia on 1 February 2006, when it was finally exposed as a hoax. [4]

MyWikiBiz
MyWikiBiz is a wiki directory that allows people and enterprises to write about themselves. The brand began as a service creating Wikipedia articles for paying corporations ; the founder and owner of MyWikiBiz, Gregory Kohs, was soon blocked from Wikipedia. [2]

History
Kohs and his sister started the MyWikiBiz venture in July 2006, as a paid editing service, writing content for inclusion in Wikipedia and other community-edited sites. Kohs charged between $49 and $99 USD for articles. [3] At the time, though it was widely known that Wikipedia was used by corporations and public relations firms, such contributions were often hidden, only to be discovered later. [4] [5] Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales expressed opposition to the idea of a paid editing service. [3]
A few days after MyWikiBiz was launched, the site's user account was blocked by Wales on the grounds of "paid editing on behalf of customers". It was one of the few such blocks personally by Wales in Wikipedia's history. [6] Wales viewed the problem as one of "conflict of interest and the appearance of impropriety arising from editors being paid to write by the subjects of the articles". [6] He and Kohs reached an agreement, under which Kohs could create "Wikipedia-like" articles on his site and that they could then be "scraped" to Wikipedia by Wikipedia editors. The agreement soon unraveled, and Kohs was blocked from editing Wikipedia. [3] [6]
In his book The Future of the Internet – And How to Stop It , Jonathan Zittrain said that Wales believed that MyWikiBiz had been "spamming Wikipedia with corporate advertisements rather than 'neutral point of view' articles", but also that MyWikiBiz persuaded some Wikipedians to lower objections to an article merely because of its source. [6]
The Chronicle of Higher Education said "it's hard to feel too bad for MyWikiBiz," and that "if the encyclopedia is serious about gaining acceptance from academe, surely it has a vested interest in dissuading companies from paying to improve their presence on the site." [2]
In late October 2006, Kohs formed a partnership to promote and market a wiki-based directory at Centiare.com, [3] [7] after which Kohs moved its contents to MyWikiBiz.com. [8]

Wikiwand
Wikiwand is a proprietary software interface developed for viewing Wikipedia articles [1] available for several popular web browsers as a free browser extension or mobile app.

History
Wikiwand (originally WikiWand) was founded in 2013 by Lior Grossman and Ilan Lewin. [2] Officially launched in August 2014, [3] the interface includes a sidebar menu, navigation bar, personalized links to other languages, new typography, and access to previews of linked articles. [4] The list of contents is constantly displayed on the left-hand side. [5]
According to Grossman, "It didn’t make sense to us that the fifth most popular website in the world, used by half a billion people, has an interface that hasn’t been updated in over a decade. We found the Wikipedia interface cluttered, hard to read (large blocks of small text), hard to navigate, and lacking in terms of usability." [6]

Availability
The interface is available on Chrome , Safari (Safari version is not available for download) and Firefox as well as via Wikiwand's website. In March 2015, Wikiwand released an iOS app for iPhone and iPad. [7]

Funding
Wikiwand was able to raise $600,000 to support the development of the interface. It has stated that it intends to donate 30% of its profits to the Wikimedia Foundation . [6] [8]

List of medical wikis
This is a list of medical wikis , collaboratively-editable websites that focus on medical information. Many of the most popular medical wikis take the form of encyclopedias , with a separate article for each medical term. Some of these websites, such as WikiDoc and Radiopaedia, are editable by anyone, while others, such as Ganfyd, restrict editing access to professionals. The majority of them have content available only in English .
The largest and most popular general encyclopedia, Wikipedia , also hosts a significant amount of health and medical information .

AskDrWiki
AskDrWiki is a medical wiki encyclopedia created by Cleveland Clinic Cardiology Fellows Kenny Civello and Brian Jefferson. The project was started as a response to the lack of free online medical information found in several community hospitals and was created to form a repository of cardiovascular information that could be readily accessed for reference. It was launched in August 2006. The site now holds medical review articles, clinical notes, pearls, and medical images. The wiki allows anyone with a medical background to contribute or edit medical articles, of which there are over 2,000 as of 2013.
The purpose of the site is to provide reliable and easily accessed health information for the medical community including physicians, nurses, and medical students. The information published on the site is not meant to supersede medical training but to serve as a repository of medical review articles to give medical professionals an online source where they can review medical topics. The website is similar to Wikipedia because it runs on MediaWiki software allowing users to add and edit articles, but differs in that all users must be credentialed based on their medical training before they are allowed to publish. Its goal is not to compete with Wikipedia regarding consumer health-related topics, but to serve as an expert medical wiki and provide a source of up-to-date medical information for healthcare providers.
In December 2006, AskDrWiki was referenced in a British Medical Journal article, "How Web 2.0 is Changing Medicine", [1] as one of the early adopters of using video hosting sites such as YouTube and Google Video to host medical videos. It was also discussed in a 2007 Nature Medicine article on medical wikis. [2] AskDrWiki has been featured in other media including The Plain Dealer , [3] Medical Economics [4] and The American Medical Association News . [5]
As of February 2015, although still online, the wiki had minimal ongoing contributions, with only 3 edits in 2014. [6]

EyeWiki
EyeWiki is a medical wiki community and online medical wiki encyclopedia , launched in July 2010 by ophthalmologists supported by the AAO . [7] The wiki provides information about eye diseases and their management, including medical and surgical treatments.
EyeWiki content is created and edited only by ophthalmologists and ophthalmologists in training. [8]

Ganfyd
Ganfyd is a medical wiki community and encyclopedia, [9] created in November 2005 by a group of doctors working in the United Kingdom . Only registered medical practitioners or persons working under their direction, and a small number of invited non-medical specialists, may edit Ganfyd articles. The intention was to make the material reliable enough for professional medical use. As of 2013 it has over 8000 content pages.

HemOnc.org
HemOnc.org is a hematology / oncology wiki which was originally created by oncologists to provide information about chemotherapy regimens and hematology/oncology medications. Its contributors are practicing physicians and other medical professionals. Its current focus is to provide clinicians referenced information about chemotherapy regimens, medications used in hematology/oncology, and to allow medical professionals to share any useful references or medical information with each other to improve their clinical & academic practice.
HemOnc.org runs on MediaWiki software and also Semantic MediaWiki . Anyone may sign up for an account and suggest additional information to be added. Editing privileges are activated for account holders whose credentials are verified. The content is not under an open license .
Data about HemOnc.org has been presented at the 2013 ASCO Quality Care Symposium, [10] and it has been profiled in the oncology press. [11] [12] The website's chemotherapy regimen database has also been used for academic research projects. [13]

Radiopaedia
Radiopaedia is a bespoke wiki-based international collaborative radiology educational resource with reference articles, radiology images, and patient cases. [14] It is aimed at registrars, residents and consultant radiology staff. [15] An iPhone/iPad application was released in 2009.
Users of the site are free to add and edit content as well as to maintain their own case library. In an attempt to reduce vandalism and peer-review content, a panel of section editors are appointed from time to time to review changes and ensure that the presented material is as accurate and relevant as possible.

WikiDoc
WikiDoc (alternatively spelled Wiki Doc ) is a medical wiki encyclopedia [9] where contributors are not required to have credentials in a biomedical field. WikiDoc was started in December 2005 by C. Michael Gibson, of Harvard Medical School . [16] [17] The original content came from Gibson's chief residency notes, board review notes, and content from a variety of copyleft sources including The U.S. National Library of Medicine , the U.S. Centers for Disease Control , Wikipedia and Ask Dr Wiki. [18] WikiDoc differs from Wikipedia in the following ways: [19] it is oriented more to medical professionals, [20] and has medical news, expanded images and videos, greatly expanded differential diagnoses in a list format and a differential diagnosis project, a toolbar to search internet on the right hand side to gather articles, guidelines and slides, a toolbar on the left to see what page most people looked at next, a board review course (in Beta testing), and editors who watch over the content.

WikEM
WikEM is a wiki-based website and point-of-care mobile application for emergency medicine clinicians. [21] WikEM started as a database created from notes and checklists passed from each resident class to the next at the Harbor-UCLA emergency medicine residency program, but is now open to all clinical providers. [22] [23] WikEM was launched in its current form in 2009. [22] WikEM's mobile applications are available in both iOS and Android, allowing for quick mobile usage, as well as offline use in austere environments and disaster situations. It calls itself The Global Emergency Medicine Wiki.

WikiLectures
WikiLectures is a collaborative project focused on creating and storing medical study materials. It is developed by students and teachers from various Czech and Slovak medical faculties. WikiLectures is part of the project MEFANET, a network linking medical schools in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. [24]
Editors of WikiLectures take care of promoting the authors, editorial process contributions, technical support, WikiLectures structure and ensure the safety of the project. WikiLectures contain articles, notes, prepared exam topics, guides for practitioners, and study books. WikiLectures are constantly growing. [25] The articles are written by medical students, faculty professionals and doctors. The administration and security is provided by the editorial board. Articles in WikiLectures are regularly checked by editors and experts in various branches of medicine. Articles checked by teachers are always marked by a special sign.

Defunct

Medcyclopaedia
The Encyclopaedia of Medical Imaging [26] was a wiki encyclopedia of medical imaging used in radiology and radiography . [27] Its online version is called Medcyclopaedia . [28] As of December 2012, the site no longer exists.
The encyclopedia was the result of a collaboration of the Nycomed Amersham Intercontinental Continuing Education in Radiology Institute ( NICER Institute ), Sweden , Department of Radiology, Lund University , Sweden, and Amersham Health , Oslo , Norway . It was provided and copyrighted by the healthcare unit of General Electric corporation. Retrieval of images (other than thumbnails) required registration.
The website contained 3,600 pages.

Medpedia
Medpedia was a collaborative project launched on 17 February 2009. Its aim was to create an open access medical wiki encyclopedia [30] in association with Harvard Medical School , Stanford School of Medicine , Berkeley School of Public Health , University of Michigan Medical School , the United Kingdom 's National Health Service (NHS) [31] as well as other contributors. [32] Content was licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike (CC-BY-SA) license and ran on modified MediaWiki software. Harvard Medical School did not have a role in, nor was it responsible for, the content that appeared in the “wiki” section of Medpedia.
Anyone with medical knowledge was welcome to become part of Medpedia's community. However, to qualify to edit or contribute to the main content, approved editors needed an M.D. , D.O. , or Ph.D. in a biomedical field. Others could contribute by writing in suggestions for changes to the site using the "Make a suggestion" link at the top of each page. An approved editor could review and potentially add submitted suggestions. [33]
Medpedia was composed of three primary components:
A 2012 literature review of 50 academic journal articles about the use of social media by clinicians [34] remarked that Medpedia had "launched in 2009 with substantial institutional backing" but that the authors "did not find articles reporting success metrics" for it.
Around January 2013 the site abruptly closed. Medpedia’s founder James Currier acknowledged that this was permanent in a blog post in July 2013. [35]

WikiSurgery
WikiSurgery is a collaboratively-built online encyclopedia hosted by the International Journal of Surgery . As of November 2013, the site's homepage is still up but none of the rest of the website is viewable.

Geshuri was described in a local newspaper article as loving Porterville and glad to have been raised in a small town, saying "I'm proud of where I'm from." [1] He said that during high school he had already planned to work for a large company, saying he was "interested in how people work and how big corporations work", so he "wanted to work in a big corporation and understand human behavior in the corporate setting". [1]
His mother, Irena Geshuri, said in 2002: "He's a keeper. He was very active. He never set still. He was always moving, always interested in everything. We had no doubt that he would succeed. He had the drive, intelligence and great parents." [1]
His wife's name is Rebecca Geshuri. They were married in 1997 or 1998. [1]

Education
Geshuri graduated from Monache High School in 1987, and Porterville College in 1989. [1] He received a bachelor's degree in psychology from the University of California, Irvine , and a master's degree in industrial and organizational psychology from San Jose State University . [1] [2]

Career and controversies

E-Trade and earlier career
Geshuri was the Vice President of People Operations and Director of Global Staffing at E-Trade Financial Corporation . [3] He also worked at Applied Materials (a major supplier of equipment and services for high-technology manufacturing), was an organizational effectiveness consultant for New United Motors Manufacturing, Inc. (an automobile manufacturing joint venture of General Motors and Toyota that was purchased by Tesla in 2010 to become the Tesla Factory ), and in 2002 he co-founded ACI Technical (Analytical and Control Instrumentation Technical Services, a startup company for analysis of water and gas quality based in Edenvale, Gauteng , South Africa ). [2] [4] [5] [6]

Google (2004–09)
He was the Senior Director of Human Resources and Staffing at Google , [3] [7] where he worked from 2004 to 2009 [8] and oversaw all aspects of recruitment. [2] [3] While working at Google, Geshuri was involved in activities that later became the subject of the High-Tech Employee Antitrust Litigation case that resulted in a settlement of $415 million paid by Adobe , Apple , Google and Intel . [9] In one incident, after hearing of a complaint from Steve Jobs of Apple, Geshuri told Google's chairman Eric Schmidt that a recruiter for Google who had tried to hire an Apple employee would be "terminated within the hour" for the action, pursuant to what Schmidt called "a policy of no recruiting from Apple". [10] Geshuri said that such terminations were taking place "every six months or so", despite efforts to make sure recruiters were aware of the policy. [10] Geshuri maintained what he called a "Do Not Call list" of companies Google would avoid recruiting from. [11]

Tesla (since November 2009)
He has been the Vice President of Human Resources at Tesla Inc. [3] since November 2009. Geshuri said the company was committed to bringing manufacturing jobs "back to California". [8] [12] In 2015, Geshuri led a hiring spree for Tesla. [13] Geshuri is placing an emphasis on hiring military veterans in large numbers. [14] [15] . He left Tesla in May 2017. [16]

Wikimedia Foundation (January 2016)
Geshuri was appointed to the Wikimedia Foundation 's Board of Trustees on January 5, 2016, with his appointment effective January 1, 2016, for a period of two years. [3] Geshuri's appointment was controversial among Wikipedia editors due to his historical involvement in the collusion over recruiting practices at Silicon Valley corporations that resulted in prosecution by the U.S. Department of Justice . [9] [17] [18] [19] A contributing factor in the controversy was that his appointment also took place in the wake of the unexpected removal of another board member, Dr. James Heilman , who had been widely supported in the Wikipedia community. [18] [19] A non-binding petition of " no confidence " on his appointment was established, and of the 312 Wikimedia contributors commenting on the petition, 290 voted to request that Geshuri be removed from the Wikimedia Board of Trustees. The board's chair and vice chair announced on January 27, 2016 that Geshuri had decided to step down from the board. They indicated that Geshuri had said he wished to avoid letting the controversy surrounding his appointment be an ongoing distraction for the Foundation and the broader community. [9] [17] [20] [21]

Wikimedia Foundation v. NSA
Wikimedia Foundation, et al. v. National Security Agency, et al. is a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) on behalf of the Wikimedia Foundation and several other organizations against the National Security Agency (NSA), the United States Department of Justice (DOJ), and other named individuals, alleging mass surveillance of Wikipedia users carried out by the NSA. [2] [3] [4] The suit claims the surveillance system, which NSA calls "Upstream" , breaches the First Amendment to the United States Constitution , which protects freedom of speech, and the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution , which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures. [5]
The suit was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland as the NSA is based in Fort Meade, Maryland . [6] The suit was dismissed in October 2015 by Judge T.S. Ellis III; this decision was appealed four months later to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals by the Wikimedia Foundation. [7] The Court of Appeals found that the dismissal was valid for all of the plaintiffs except the Foundation, whose allegations the court found "plausible" enough to have legal standing for the case to be remanded to the lower court. [8]
The plaintiffs are the Wikimedia Foundation, [9] the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers , Human Rights Watch , Amnesty International USA , the PEN American Center , the Global Fund for Women , The Nation magazine, [10] the Rutherford Institute , and the Washington Office on Latin America . [5] [11]

Background
Upstream surveillance was first revealed in May 2013 by Edward Snowden , a former NSA analyst. [12] A previous challenge by the ACLU, Clapper v. Amnesty International USA , failed for lack of standing . In the light of some of the leaks by Snowden, which included an above Top Secret NSA slide that specifically referred to Wikipedia as a target for HTTP surveillance, the Wikimedia Foundation pushed forward with a legal complaint against the NSA for violating its users' First and Fourth Amendment rights. [13]
Since Clapper , the government itself has confirmed many of the key facts about NSA's Upstream surveillance, including that it conducts suspicionless searches. [9] ACLU attorney Patrick Toomey noted the lawsuit is particularly relevant as the plaintiffs engage in "hundreds of billions of international communications" annually. Any program of Upstream surveillance must necessarily sweep up a substantial part of these communications. [9] [14]

Litigation
On August 6, 2015, the defendants (National Security Agency, et al.) brought a motion to dismiss, arguing that the plaintiffs have not plausibly shown that they have been injured by Upstream collection of data and thus lack standing to sue. In response, the Electronic Frontier Foundation filed an amicus brief on behalf of a group of libraries and booksellers. [16] Both sides presented oral arguments at a hearing on September 25, 2015. [17]
On October 23, 2015, the District Court for the District of Maryland dismissed the suit on grounds of standing . US District Judge T. S. Ellis III ruled that the plaintiffs could not plausibly prove they were subject to Upstream surveillance, echoing the 2013 decision in Clapper v. Amnesty International US . [18] [19] The Wikimedia Foundation said it expected to appeal the decision. The Foundation said its complaint had merit, and that there was no question that Upstream surveillance captured the communications of both its user community and the Wikimedia Foundation itself. [20] The Electronic Frontier Foundation, who had filed an amicus brief in support of the plaintiffs, said it was perverse to dismiss a suit for lack of proof (standing) when the surveillance program complained of was secret, and urged federal courts to tackle the serious constitutional issues that Upstream surveillance presents. [21] The plaintiffs filed an appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit on February 17, 2016. [22]
On May 23, 2017, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the dismissal by the lower court of Wikimedia's complaints. [23] [24] The Court of Appeals ruled that the Foundation's allegations of the NSA's Fourth Amendment violations were plausible enough to "survive a facial challenge to standing", finding that the potential harm done by the NSA's collection of private data was not speculative. [7] [23] The court thereby remanded the suit by the Foundation and ordered the District Court of Maryland to continue the proceedings. [8] The court inversely affirmed the dismissal by Ellis of the suits by the other plaintiffs; in its finding the court noted that the non-Wikimedia plaintiffs had not made a strong enough case that their operations were affected by Upstream's scope. [7] [23]

Indonesian Wikipedia
The Indonesian Wikipedia ( Indonesian : Wikipedia bahasa Indonesia ) [1] [2] is the edition of Wikipedia in the Indonesian language . The Indonesian Wikipedia is the fifth-fastest-growing Wikipedia in an Asian language after the Japanese, Chinese, Korean, and Turkish language Wikipedias. Its first article was written on May 30, 2003, [3] [4] yet its Main Page was created six months later on November 29, 2003. [5]
There are 402,675 articles in the Indonesian Wikipedia. In April 2016, there were 462 editors who made at least five edits in that month.

Background
Although the Indonesian language is similar to the Malay language , the Indonesian Wikipedia remains separate from the Malay Wikipedia [6] (initiated on October 2002). [7] The Indonesian and Malay Wikipedias were started separately by two different user groups within six months of each other. In 2009, Andrew Lih wrote "Because these groups are drawn on national boundaries, merging is not likely to happen soon." [6]
Indonesian is a normative form of the Malay language, an Austronesian (or Malayo-Polynesian) language which had been used as a lingua franca in the Indonesian archipelago for centuries, and was elevated to the status of an official language with the Indonesian Declaration of Independence in 1945, drawing inspiration from the Sumpah Pemuda ( Youth Pledge ) event in 1928. It is very similar to the official Malaysian form of the language. However, it does differ from the Malaysian form in some ways, with key differences in pronunciation and vocabulary, due in large part to the many Dutch words in the Indonesian vocabulary. It is spoken as a mother tongue by only 7% of the population of Indonesia, but altogether more than 200 million people speak it. [8] The Malay language is spoken by ethnic groups who reside in the Malay Peninsula , southern Thailand , parts of the Philippines , and Singapore . Malay is also considered one of the dialects of the Indonesian language by Indonesians living in central eastern Sumatra, the Riau Islands and parts of the coast of Borneo. [9]
The Indonesian Wikipedia has more articles on the administrative regions in Indonesia than any other of Wikipedia's languages. [10]

Contributors
In 2004, Tempo magazine published a feature about the Indonesian Wikipedia, in which Revo Soekatno , one of its best known contributors, described it as the "Encyclopedia from the boarding houses", meaning an encyclopedia that was produced by Indonesians living and studying overseas. The article contributed to the popularization of Wikipedia in the archipelago and since then, the Indonesian Wikipedia has seen its number of users rise remarkably. [11] [12]
In 2006, following Time featuring "You" as its person of the year, [13] Kompas published a feature article on Revo where he was called the "Father of Wikipedia in Indonesian". The article highlighted the spirit of participation as the type of "addiction to the cyberspace that needed to be endorsed". [14] Other Indonesian publications followed suit to refer to Revo Soekatno as an "activist that built a community portal in Indonesia" praising his contributions to the presence of Indonesia in the Internet. [15]
In February 2009, the Indonesian Wikipedia achieved the milestone of 100,000 articles. One of the contributors mentioned in the article was the user borgx, who made 80 thousand edits starting in 2005. That year, the Indonesian Wikipedia had only fifty active contributors. [16] [17]

Workshop and seminars
In March 2007, Bina Nusantara University invited Indonesian Wikipedians to speak at the first Wikipedia seminar for the public and to introduce Wikipedia Bahasa Indonesia and Wikimedia Foundation projects at its campus in Jakarta . [18]
In November 2007, the Indonesian Government, through its Department of Communication and Information, decided to establish an annual Indonesian ICT Award and invited the Indonesian Wikipedia Community to hold a workshop on how to write Wikipedia articles. [19] [20] Ivan Lanin , one of the speakers interviewed by Antara , stated that the number of contributors to the Indonesian Wikipedia was rising, and the articles were beginning to become more diverse. According to Revo's speech, the challenge for the Indonesian Wikipedia in the future was to gain credibility and give the public assurance about the quality of the content provided.
The first day of the workshop was attended by 40 people, although the number of computers provided for hands-on practice was considerably less than the number of participants. [21]
The following year, at the 2008 Indonesian ICT Awards, the Indonesian Wikipedia Community held separate workshop sessions for the public and for organizations. [22]

Indonesian Wikipedia DVD
In August 2008, the Indonesian version of CHIP Magazine distributed a complimentary DVD containing more than 80,000 articles (without images) with its 11th anniversary edition. This edition also featured a three-page Wikipedia article titled " Wikipedia: When one thousand brains are better than one ". The article provided an extensive history of Wikipedia, including the Indonesian Wikipedia, as well as a description of the Wikimedia Indonesia chapter, which was in preparation at that time. [23]
However, a DVD version of the Indonesian Wikipedia with photos was already in existence since April 2008 and could be purchased online from an independent vendor for 20 thousand rupiah, around US$2. [24]

[2] In January 2007, the Turkish Wikipedia was given the award for "Best Content" in this competition. The award was given in a ceremony on 25 January 2007 at Istanbul Technical University . [3] [4]
In 2015, its banner drawing attention to the gender bias on Wikipedia drew the attention of Turkish media. [5]
On 29 April 2017, the Turkish government blocked access to Wikipedia . [6] While the reasons for the blockage are unrevealed, some believe that the encyclopedia has been blocked because the Turkish government is concerned about the appearance of articles critical of its actions regarding Turkey–ISIL cooperation .

Southern Min Wikipedia
The Southern Min Wikipedia ( Pe̍h-ōe-jī : Wikipedia Bân-lâm-gú ) or Holopedia [1] is the Southern Min edition of Wikipedia , the free encyclopedia. It is the second largest Wikipedia in a variety of Chinese . [2] Written in Pe̍h-ōe-jī , it mainly uses the Hokkien Taiwanese dialect. As of November 2016, it has over 200,000 articles. [3]

History
The Southern Min Wikipedia was founded as an independent project known as Holopedia (a reference to Hō-ló-oē, a colloquial name for the Southern Min dialect) by Wikipedians Pektiong and Kaihsu (Tè Khái-sū) in 2003. A request was then made at the Wikimedia Foundation's Meta-Wiki to create the Wikipedia project for this language.

ISO code
At the time of creation there was no ISO 639 code for Southern Min, so the founders decided to use "zh-min-nan", which had been registered as an IETF language tag . [4] Now there is an ISO code for Southern Min (nan) and the domain http://nan.wikipedia.org redirects to http://zh-min-nan.wikipedia.org/ .
The Southern Min Wikipedia is the only Wikipedia to have two hyphens in the code, although "be-x-old" was formerly used for the Belarusian Wikipedia in classical orthography.
In August 2015, the Wikipedians of Southern Min Wikipedia reached a new consensus to officially use "nan" as the language code; however, the consensus hasn't been executed yet. [5] [6]

Telugu Wikipedia
The Telugu Wikipedia was started on December 10, 2003 by Venna Nagarjuna , renowned for Padma , a system for transforming text in Indic scripts between various public and proprietary formats. As of August 28, 2016, the article count stood at 65,048 and is fifth among the Indian language Wikipedias, next to Hindi , Urdu , Tamil and Newar . [1]

Initial growth
In 2005, Telugu Wikipedia received a much-needed initial thrust when pioneer Chava Kiran, Akkineni Pradeep, Satya, Veeven and Charivari (who later spearheaded e-Telugu campaign) joined. Vyzas Satya planned and executed a project to have stubs for districts, mandals and Telugu movies with the help of a bot. The stubs were expanded into articles with the help of several volunteers from Telugu online/blogging community. Charivari translated and drafted many of the initial working policies. Pradeep wrote scripts to automate many of the mundane tasks. The article count became 6000.

Promotion
A symbiotic relationship fostered by the initial Telugu blogger-Wikipedian members with the larger Telugu online community proved to be a big boon for Telugu Wikipedia's initial growth. Having gained initial momentum, it was furthered by committed members like Kasubabu, Dr. Rajasekhar, Chandrakantha Rao, Ravichandra, Veeven, Kasyap, Rahamtulla and Sujatha. Wikipedia was promoted through book fairs at Hyderabad and Vijayawada with active support from e-Telugu organization and the local-language media. This generated a lot of interest among the general public
Telugu Wiktionary is another notable project, with a major contribution from Sujatha. Brown's English-Telugu dictionary was incorporated into Telugu Wiktionary in its entirety using a bot script written by another pioneer Telugu Wikipedian, Makineni Pradeep.
In 2010, e-zine called Tewiki Vartha was started to share behind scenes stories of Telugu Wiki sites and wiki Editors.
Telugu wiki academies were initiated in 2009 to create more awareness in Engineering and MCA colleges in small towns of Andhra Pradesh .
In 2012, another effort was made to revitalize the Wikipedia . The community had for the first time organized a 2-day celebration in Hyderabad during April 10&11 2013, coinciding with the start of Telugu New year. [2] and now all entire Telugu Wikipedia is made available in kiwix in offline also.you can download kiwix for windows and android from store freely. and you can download Telugu data dump from this link .
HMTV broadcast a documentary on Wikipedia Celebrations [3] Rajasekhar, Rahimanuddin, Malladi and Vishnuvardhan participated in a phone-in program about Wikipedia. [4] [5]

Pageviews
Pageviews of Telugu Wikipedia for October 2013 are at 2.1M. The highest recorded pageviews of 4.5M where for Feb 2010.

Fonts and input methods
Any one of Unicode Telugu font input systems are fine for Telugu Wikipedia. Some people use inscript . Many use either Google phonetic transliteration or input facility Universal Language Selector provided on Telugu Wikipedia. Currently, Telugu Wikipedia is supported by Universal Language Selector (ULS) , that offers both phonetic keyboard and InScript keyboard .

Belarusian Wikipedia
There are two Belarusian Wikipedias ( Belarusian : Беларуская Вікіпедыя ; Taraškievica : Беларуская Вікіпэдыя) : one in the orthography of the Belarusian language which is official in modern Belarus ( Narkomovka , prefix "be:"), [8] and another one in the pre-reform of 1933 , classical orthography ( Taraškievica , prefix "be-tarask:", formerly "be-x-old:"). [9]
As of March 2014, the most popular editions of Wikipedia within Belarus are the Russian Wikipedia (with 84.0% of all page views ) followed by the English Wikipedia (10.2%). [10]

History
The first Belarusian Wikipedia was started on August 12, 2004. One of its creators and first administrators was Uladzimir Katkouski (user name: rydel). [11] [12] Katkouski/rydel (who died in 2007) created over 1,300 articles in the Belarusian Wikipedia alone. [12]
Articles in the Belarusian Wikipedia were inconsistently written in both variants of the orthography, leading to conflicts between the adherents of the two. [13] [14]
A "clean" version in the official orthography was initiated in the Wikipedias " incubator " at Wikimedia 's Meta-Wiki. [14] However, the first application for a new Wikipedia was rejected in December 2006 by the Board of Trustees and Language Commission for technical reasons, quoting: "This discussion was created before the implementation of the Language proposal policy, and it is incompatible with the policy." [15] A redrafted proposal was approved in March 2007. [16]
Upon approval, in the evening of the same day, over 6,000 articles written in the pre-reform orthography were transferred from the "be.wikipedia.org" domain to "be-x-old.wikipedia.org", while the 3,500 pages from "Incubator" were moved [17] to "be.wikipedia.org". [14] However, due to a software bug, the move did not go smoothly: in the morning the articles seemed to have disappeared, and users could not log in. [18] This led to a number of news reports that articles in old Belarusian orthography were deleted from Wikipedia. [19] [20]
In September 2015, the domain name of the classical orthography Belarusian Wikipedias was changed from be-x-old.wikipedia.org to be-tarask.wikipedia.org, reflecting the official language subtag assigned by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority in 2007.
Including the time in the "incubator", the current variant of be-Wikipedia has existed since August 2006. [21]

Rates of contribution
Initially the official Belarusian Wikipedia overtook the classical one, but in about a year, it slowed down, and in fall 2008, the classical one was ahead. [13] Today, the official Belarusian Wikipedia has again surpassed the one in the classical orthography.
On March 15, 2008 the official Belarusian encyclopedia reached 10,000 articles. [21]
On June 17, 2009, the classical Belarusian encyclopedia reached 20,000 articles, holding the 65th place among other Wikipedias. At that time, the official Belarusian Wikipedia had about 16,000 articles, holding the 71st place. [13]
On November 16, 2010 the official Belarusian encyclopedia reached 25,000 articles.
In August 2015, the official Belarusian encyclopedia reached 100,000 articles.

Kannada Wikipedia
The Kannada Wikipedia ( ಕನ್ನಡ ವಿಕಿಪೀಡಿಯ ) is the Kannada language edition of Wikipedia . Started in June 2003, it's moderately active and as of May 2017, it has 21,891 articles with 91 active users. [1] Also, It is the 12th most popular Wikipedia in the Indian subcontinent . [2]
The Kannada Wikipedia community held a meeting in Bangalore on April 2, 2006, which got fairly high press coverage. [3]

History
As of August 16, 2009 the Wiki had about 6,800 articles, [4] making it the 100th biggest Wikipedia edition.
As of January 2013, it has 12,961 articles with 93 active users and 2,680 images, making it the 108th Wikipedia by articles count, at that time. [2]
As of January 2016, the Kannada Wikipedia is the tenth largest and thus the smallest Wikipedia among other Indian language Wikipedias. Administrator Omshivaprakash attributes the lack of articles to a lack of interest among the Kannada-speaking community, a lack of awareness of the Kannada Wikipedia and Kannada typing tools, and limited Internet access in parts of Karnataka . [5]

Irish Wikipedia
The Irish Wikipedia ( Irish : Vicipéid na Gaeilge ) is the Irish-language version of Wikipedia , run by the Wikimedia Foundation and established in October 2003, with the first article being written in January 2004. The founder of Vicipéid was Gabriel Beecham. [1] In September 2005 over 1600 articles had been written, with 173 contributors (both regular and irregular) having written material. [1] By March 2007, about 20 regular Wikipedians were writing articles, with up to seven thousand articles having been created. [2] In November 2013, it went over the 28,000 article mark, making it the 85th largest Wikipedia by article count.
The Vicipéid now encompasses a wide range of subjects, including topics as diverse as philosophy, [3] genetics, [4] Aboriginal bark canoes [5] and maritime terminology. [6] The Vicipéid also draws (with permission) directly from Fréamh an Eolais , an Irish-language encyclopedia of science and technology. [7]
The Vicipéid has been favourably received by Irish-language media. [1] [8] [9] In his paper on Putting the learning back into learning technology , Barry McMullin of Dublin City University suggested that while the Irish Wikipedia is never likely to contain as many articles as the Wikipedias in the world's most widespread languages, it is still a useful resource. [10] He felt that when seeking knowledge about certain topic areas it was likely to be more useful than the Wikipedias in English and other languages, because of its evolution to contain the only, primary or definitive Wikipedia articles in any language on those areas. [10]
Other academic sources have emphasised the site's educational value. [11] The role of the Vicipéid as an educational tool at tertiary level has been acknowledged in the context of Wikimedia use, involving projects supported by NUI Galway . [12]

Silesian Wikipedia
Silesian Wikipedia ( Silesian : Ślůnsko Wikipedyjo ) is the Silesian edition of Wikipedia . It was started on 26 May 2008.

History
The first attempt to launch the Silesian Wikipedia project took place in March 2006, [1] but because of negative comments in the discussion section, the proposal was rejected. [2]
In 2007 Wikipedia officially registered the Silesian language in its list of languages. [ clarification needed ] The International Linguistic Organization SIL International followed this step on 18 July 2007 and International Organization for Standardization (ISO) assigned it the ISO code "szl". [3] [4] [5] [6]
A second application for a Wikipedia project in the Silesian language was submitted on 19 March 2008 [7] as a result of discussions on the removal of articles written in Silesian language, which remained in the Polish edition of Wikipedia (in Silesia Wikiproject). [8] [9] After the initial acceptance of the proposal (100% positive, 0% negative votes) 31 March 2008, a test project was created in the Incubator Wikimedia projects. The following month it contained 100 articles in Silesian, including more than 1,800 separate pages. After two months all eight requirements necessary to create a new Wikipedia were implemented and finally Silesian Wikipedia was founded on 26 May 2008. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] The 1,000th article was included on 15 November 2008.
In October 2010 the Silesian Wikipedia was mentioned as one of the arguments for Silesian to become one of the regional languages in Poland. The project of the law implementing Silesian as a regional language was introduced to Sejm by parliament member Marek Plura . [18]

Wolof Wikipedia
The Wolof Wikipedia is the edition of Wikipedia in the Wolof language . It currently has 1,146 articles.
The Wikipedia was started in the beginning of 2005, along with the Bambara Wikipedia and the Fula Wikipedia . Kasper Souren, a Dutchman who worked with Geekcorps , wrote in a report to an open source conference that until 2006 "not much happened" on the Wolof Wikipedia. [1] Up until that year, many small articles with very little content were posted.
In April 2007 Ibrahima Fall (username Ibou), a Senegalese student living in Italy , began adding substantial content to the Wolof Wikipedia. [1] It had 500 articles in November 2007, 543 articles in June 2008, and 1028 articles in August 2015. [1] [2]

List of Wikipedias
This is a list of the different language editions of Wikipedia ; as of 25 May 2017 there are 296 Wikipedias of which 285 are active.

Wikipedia edition codes
Each Wikipedia has a code, which is used as a subdomain below wikipedia.org. Interlanguage links are sorted by that code. The codes represent the language codes defined by ISO 639-1 and ISO 639-3 , and the decision of which language code to use is usually determined by the IETF language tag policy. Wikipedias also vary by how thinly they slice dialects and variants; for example, the English Wikipedia includes most modern varieties of English (American English, Indian English, South African English, etc.), but does not include other related languages such as Scots , or Anglo-Saxon , all of which have separate Wikipedias. The Spanish Wikipedia includes both Peninsular Castilian and Latin American Spanish ; Malay Wikipedia includes a large number of Malay languages; and so on.
Differences between the ISO mappings and Wikipedia codes include:
Additionally, Wikipedias vary in wikt:orthography at times. Chinese Wikipedia automatically translates from modern Mandarin Chinese into four standard forms: Mainland China and Singapore in simplified Chinese characters, and Taiwan and Hong Kong / Macau in traditional Chinese characters. Belarussian , however, has a separate Wikipedia for the 'normative' orthography (be) and Taraškievica (be-tarask).

List
An approximation to the number of active users is given in powers of ten (see common logarithm ): so "5" means at least 10,000, "4" means at least 1000, "3" means at least 100, and so on.

Work of art
A work of art , artwork , art piece , piece of art or art object is an aesthetic physical item or artistic creation. Apart from "work of art", which may be used of any work regarded as art in its widest sense, including works from literature and music, these terms apply principally to tangible, portable forms of visual art :
Used more broadly, the term is less commonly applied to:
This article is concerned with the terms and concept as used in and applied to the visual arts, although other fields such as aural - music and written word- literature have similar issues and philosophies. The term objet d'art is reserved to describe works of art that are not paintings, prints, drawings or large or medium-sized sculptures, or architecture (e.g. household goods, figurines, etc., some purely aesthetic, some also practical). The term oeuvre is used to describe the complete body of work completed by an artist throughout a career. [2]

Definition
A work of art in the visual arts is a physical two- or three- dimensional object that is professionally determined or otherwise considered to fulfill a primarily independent aesthetic function. A singular art object is often seen in the context of a larger art movement or artistic era , such as: a genre , aesthetic convention , culture , or regional-national distinction. [3] It can also be seen as an item within an artist's "body of work" or oeuvre . The term is commonly used by: museum and cultural heritage curators , the interested public, the art patron -private art collector community, and art galleries . [4]
Physical objects that document immaterial or conceptual art works, but do not conform to artistic conventions can be redefined and reclassified as art objects. Some Dada and Neo-Dada conceptual and readymade works have received later inclusion. Also, some architectural renderings and models of unbuilt projects, such as by Vitruvius , Leonardo da Vinci , Frank Lloyd Wright , and Frank Gehry , are other examples.
The products of environmental design , depending on intention and execution, can be "works of art" and include: land art , site-specific art , architecture , gardens , landscape architecture , installation art , rock art , and megalithic monuments .
Legal definitions of "work of art" are used in copyright law; see Visual arts#United States of America copyright definition of visual art .

Theories
Marcel Duchamp critiqued the idea that the work of art should be a unique product of an artist's labour, representational of their technical skill or artistic caprice. [ citation needed ] Theorists have argued that objects and people do not have a constant meaning, but their meanings are fashioned by humans in the context of their culture, as they have the ability to make things mean or signify something. [5]
Artist Michael Craig-Martin , creator of An Oak Tree , said of his work - "It's not a symbol. I have changed the physical substance of the glass of water into that of an oak tree. I didn't change its appearance. The actual oak tree is physically present, but in the form of a glass of water." [6]

Distinctions
Some art theorists and writers have long made a distinction between the physical qualities of an art object and its identity-status as an artwork. [7] For example, a painting by Rembrandt has a physical existence as an "oil painting on canvas" that is separate from its identity as a masterpiece "work of art" or the artist's magnum opus . [8] Many works of art are initially denied "museum quality" or artistic merit, and later become accepted and valued in museum and private collections. Works by the Impressionists and non-representational abstract artists are examples. Some, such as the "Readymades" of Marcel Duchamp including his infamous urinal Fountain , are later reproduced as museum quality replicas.
There is an indefinite distinction, for current or historical aesthetic items: between " fine art " objects made by " artists "; and folk art , craft-work , or " applied art " objects made by "first, second, or third-world" designers , artisans and craftspeople . Contemporary and archeological indigenous art , industrial design items in limited or mass production , and places created by environmental designers and cultural landscapes , are some examples. The term has been consistently available for debate, reconsideration, and redefinition.

Public domain
The term public domain has two senses of meaning. Anything published is out in the public domain in the sense that it is available to the public . [1] Once published, news and information in books is in the public domain, although they may also be copyrighted. In the sense of intellectual property, works in the public domain are those whose exclusive intellectual property rights have expired, [2] have been forfeited, [3] or are inapplicable. [4] For example, the works of Shakespeare and Beethoven , and most of the early silent films , are all now in the public domain by either being created before copyrights existed or leaving the copyright term . [2] Examples for works not covered by copyright which are therefore in the public domain, are the formulae of Newtonian physics , cooking recipes , [5] and all software before 1974. [6] Examples for works actively dedicated into public domain by their authors are reference implementations of cryptographic algorithms , [7] [8] [9] NIH 's ImageJ , [10] and the CIA 's World Factbook . [11] The term is not normally applied to situations where the creator of a work retains residual rights, in which case use of the work is referred to as "under license" or "with permission".
As rights are country-based and vary, a work may be subject to rights in one country and be in the public domain in another. Some rights depend on registrations on a country-by-country basis, and the absence of registration in a particular country, if required, creates public domain status for a work in that country.

History
Although the term "public domain" did not come into use until the mid-18th century, the concept "can be traced back to the ancient Roman Law, as a preset system included in the property right system." [12] The Romans had a large proprietary rights system where they defined "many things that cannot be privately owned" [12] as res nullius , res communes , res publicae and res universitatis . The term res nullius was defined as things not yet appropriated. [13] The term res communes was defined as "things that could be commonly enjoyed by mankind, such as air, sunlight and ocean." [12] The term res publicae referred to things that were shared by all citizens, and the term res universitatis meant things that were owned by the municipalities of Rome. [12] When looking at the public domain from a historical perspective, one could say the construction of the idea of "public domain" sprouted from the concepts of res communes , res publicae , and res universitatis in early Roman law . [12]
When the first early copyright law was first established in Britain with the Statute of Anne in 1710, public domain did not appear. However, similar concepts were developed by British and French jurists in the eighteenth century. Instead of "public domain" they used terms such as publici juris or propriété publique to describe works that were not covered by copyright law. [14]
The phrase "fall in the public domain" can be traced to mid-nineteenth century France to describe the end of copyright term . The French poet Alfred de Vigny equated the expiration of copyright with a work falling "into the sink hole of the public domain" [15] and if the public domain receives any attention from intellectual property lawyers it is still treated as little more than that which is left when intellectual property rights, such as copyright , patents , and trademarks , expire or are abandoned. [16] In this historical context Paul Torremans describes copyright as a "little coral reef of private right jutting up from the ocean of the public domain." [17] Because copyright law is different from country to country, Pamela Samuelson has described the public domain as being "different sizes at different times in different countries". [18]

Definition
Definitions of the boundaries of the public domain in relation to copyright, or intellectual property more generally, regard the public domain as a negative space, that is, it consists of works that are no longer in copyright term or were never protected by copyright law. [19] According to James Boyle this definition underlines common usage of the term public domain and equates the public domain to public property and works in copyright to private property . However, the usage of the term public domain can be more granular, including for example uses of works in copyright permitted by copyright exceptions . Such a definition regards work in copyright as private property subject to fair use rights and limitation on ownership. [2] A conceptual definition comes from Lange, who focused on what the public domain should be: "it should be a place of sanctuary for individual creative expression, a sanctuary conferring affirmative protection against the forces of private appropriation that threatened such expression". [19] Patterson and Lindberg described the public domain not as a "territory", but rather as a concept: "[T]here are certain materials – the air we breathe, sunlight, rain, space, life, creations, thoughts, feelings, ideas, words, numbers – not subject to private ownership. The materials that compose our cultural heritage must be free for all living to use no less than matter necessary for biological survival." [20] The term public domain may also be interchangeably used with other imprecise and/or undefined terms such as the " public sphere " or " commons ", including concepts such as "commons of the mind", the "intellectual commons", and the "information commons". [16]

Public domain by medium

Public domain books
A public domain book is a book with no copyright, a book that was created without a license, or a book where its copyrights expired [21] or have been forfeited. [22] Every book and tale written prior to 1787 (or 1945 in most countries) is in the public domain, among them, every book written by Jane Austen , Lewis Carroll , Edgar Allan Poe and H. G. Wells .

18th century

19th century

20th century
These books are commonly found either online or on libraries in diverse formats like . PDF , . Doc , and can be converted to EPUB by a click with Calibre and Sigil (both free software). Everybody can download, copy, edit and read them in a digital way, on ebook readers, computers, and print them freely and without restrictions.

Public domain music
Music has been created and played by humans for millennia. An object identified as a possible flute (the Divje Babe Flute ) is more than 40,000 years old. Even if humans had musical instruments and made music there was a need for a musical notation system to be able to preserve song through writing. The first such system, the Music of Mesopotamia notation system , was created 4000 years ago. In the tenth century Guido of Arezzo introduced Latin musical notations. [ citation needed ] All this laid the foundation for the preservation of global music belonging to the public domain since the beginning of musical history to the present.
The Musopen project records music in the public domain for the purposes of making the music available to the general public in a high-quality audio format. Online musical archives such as Archive.com preserve collections of classical music recorded by Museopen and offer them for download/distribution as a public service.

Public domain films
A public domain film is a film that was released to public domain by its author or because its copyright has expired. In 2016 there are more than 2000 films on public domain in every genre, from musicals to romance, horror to animated movies and noir to western movies. [ citation needed ]

Value
Pamela Samuelson has identified eight "values" that can arise from information and works in the public domain. [23] :22
Possible values include:

Relationship with derivative works
Derivative works include translations , musical arrangements , and dramatizations of a work, as well as other forms of transformation or adaptation. [25] Copyrighted works may not be used for derivative works without permission from the copyright owner, [26] while public domain works can be freely used for derivative works without permission. [27] [28] Artworks that are public domain may also be reproduced photographically or artistically or used as the basis of new, interpretive works. [29] Works derived from public domain works can be copyrighted. [30]
Once works enter into the public domain, derivative works such as adaptations in book and film may increase noticeably, as happened with Frances Hodgson Burnett 's novel The Secret Garden , which became public domain in 1987. [31] By 1999, the plays of Shakespeare, all public domain, had been used in more than 420 feature-length films. [32] In addition to straightforward adaptation, they have been used as the launching point for transformative retellings such as Tom Stoppard 's Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead and Troma Entertainment 's Romeo and Juliet . [33] [34] [35] Marcel Duchamp's L.H.O.O.Q. is a derivative of Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa , one of thousands of derivative works based on the public domain painting. [27]

Perpetual copyright
Some works may never fully lapse into the public domain. A perpetual crown copyright is held for the Authorized King James Version of the Bible in the UK. [36]
While the copyright of the Peter Pan works by J. M. Barrie (the play Peter Pan, or the Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up and the novel Peter and Wendy ) has expired in the United Kingdom, it was granted a special exception under the Copyright, Designs, and Patents Act 1988 (Schedule 6) [37] that requires royalties to be paid for commercial performances, publications and broadcasts of the story of Peter Pan within the UK, as long as Great Ormond Street Hospital (to whom Barrie gave the copyright) continues to exist.

Public domain mark
The Creative Commons proposed in 2010 the Public Domain Mark (PDM) as symbol to indicate that a work is free of known copyright restrictions and therefore in the public domain. [38] [39] The copyright mark is analogous to the copyright symbol , which acts as copyright notice . The Europeana databases use it, and for instance on the Wikimedia Commons in February 2016 2.9 million works (~10% of all works) are listed as PDM . [40]

Application to copyrightable works

Works not covered by copyright law
The underlying idea that is expressed or manifested in the creation of a work generally cannot be the subject of copyright law (see idea–expression divide ). Mathematical formulae will therefore generally form part of the public domain, to the extent that their expression in the form of software is not covered by copyright.
Works created before the existence of copyright and patent laws also form part of the public domain. For example, the Bible and the inventions of Archimedes are in the public domain, but copyright may exist in translations, or new formulations, or digitized editions of these works, so for example most translations of the Bible into foreign languages and the digital editions of these are copyrighted.

Expiration of copyright
Determination of whether a copyright has expired depends on an examination of the copyright in its "source country".
In the United States, determining whether a work has entered the public domain or is still under copyright can be quite complex, primarily because copyright terms have been extended multiple times and in different ways—shifting over the course of the 20th century from a fixed-term based on first publication, with a possible renewal term, to a term extending to fifty, then seventy, years after the death of the author. The claim that "pre-1923 works are in the public domain" is correct only for published works; unpublished works are under federal copyright for at least the life of the author plus 70 years.
In most other countries that are signatories to the Berne Convention , copyright term is based on the life of the author, and extends to 50 or 70 years beyond the death of the author. (See List of countries' copyright lengths .)
Legal traditions differ on whether a work in the public domain can have its copyright restored. In the European Union, the Copyright Duration Directive was applied retroactively, restoring and extending the terms of copyright on material previously in the public domain. Term extensions by the U.S. and Australia generally have not removed works from the public domain, but rather delayed the addition of works to it. However, the United States moved away from that tradition with the Uruguay Round Agreements Act , which removed from the public domain many foreign-sourced works that had previously not been in copyright in the US for failure to comply with US-based formalities requirements . Consequently, in the US, foreign-sourced works and US-sourced works are now treated differently, with foreign-sourced works remaining under copyright regardless of compliance with formalities, while domestically-sourced works may be in the public domain if they failed to comply with then-existing formalities requirements—a situation described as odd by some scholars, and unfair by some US-based rightsholders. [41]

Government works
Works of the United States Government and various other governments are excluded from copyright law and may therefore be considered to be in the public domain in their respective countries. [42] In the United States, when copyrighted material is enacted into the law, it enters the public domain. Thus, e.g., the building codes , when enacted, are in the public domain. [43] They may also be in the public domain in other countries as well. "It is axiomatic that material in the public domain is not protected by copyright, even when incorporated into a copyrighted work." [44]

Dedicating works to the public domain

Release without copyright notice
Before 1988 in the US, works could be easily given into the public domain by just releasing it without an explicit Copyright notice . With the Berne Convention Implementation Act of 1988 (and the earlier Copyright Act of 1976 , which went into effect in 1978), all works were by default copyright protected and needed to be actively given into public domain by a waiver statement/ anti-copyright notice . [45] [46] Not all legal systems have processes for reliably donating works to the public domain, e.g. civil law of continental Europe . [ citation needed ] This may even "effectively prohibit any attempt by copyright owners to surrender rights automatically conferred by law, particularly moral rights ". [47]

Public domain like licenses
An alternative is for copyright holders to issue a licence which irrevocably grants as many rights as possible to the general public. Real public domain makes licenses unnecessary, as no owner/author is required to grant permission (" Permission culture "). There are multiple licenses which aim release works into the public domain. In 2000 the WTFPL was released as public domain like software license . [48] In 2009 the Creative commons released the CC0 , which was created for compatibility with also law domains which have no concept of dedicating into public domain . This is achieved by a public domain waiver statement and a fall-back all-permissive license, in case the waiver is not possible. [49] [50] The Unlicense , published around 2010, has a focus on an Anti-copyright message. The Unlicense offers a public domain waiver text with a fall-back public domain-like license inspired by permissive licenses but without attribution. [51] [52]
In October 2014 the Open Knowledge Foundation recommends the Creative Commons CC0 license to dedicate content to the public domain, [53] [54] and the Open Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and License (PDDL) for data. [55]

Patents
In most countries the term or rights for patents is 20 years, after which the invention becomes part of the public domain. In the United States, the contents of patents are considered valid and enforceable for twenty years from the date of filing within the United States or twenty years from the earliest date of filing if under 35 USC 120, 121, or 365(c). [56] However, the text and any illustration within a patent, provided the illustrations are essentially line drawings and do not in any substantive way reflect the "personality" of the person drawing them, are not subject to copyright protection. [57] This is separate from the patent rights just mentioned.

Trademarks
A trademark registration may remain in force indefinitely, or expire without specific regard to its age. For a trademark registration to remain valid, the owner must continue to use it. In some circumstances, such as disuse, failure to assert trademark rights, or common usage by the public without regard for its intended use, it could become generic , and therefore part of the public domain.
Because trademarks are registered with governments, some countries or trademark registries may recognize a mark, while others may have determined that it is generic and not allowable as a trademark in that registry. For example, the drug "acetylsalicylic acid" (2-acetoxybenzoic acid) is better known as aspirin in the United States—a generic term. In Canada, however, "Aspirin", with an uppercase A, is still a trademark of the German company Bayer , while aspirin, with a lowercase "a", is not. Bayer lost the trademark in the United States, the UK and France after World War I, as part of the Treaty of Versailles . So many copycat products entered the marketplace during the war that it was deemed generic just three years later. [58]
Bayer also lost the trademark for "Heroin", [ where? ] which it trademarked a year before it trademarked Aspirin. [ citation needed ]
Although Hormel resigned itself to genericide, [59] it has fought attempts by other companies to register " spam " as a trademark in relation to computer products . [60]

Public Domain Day
Public Domain Day is an observance of when copyrights expire and works enter into the public domain. [61] This legal transition of copyright works into the public domain usually happens every year on 1 January based on the individual copyright laws of each country . [61]
The observance of a "Public Domain Day" was initially informal; the earliest known mention was in 2004 by Wallace McLean (a Canadian public domain activist), [62] with support for the idea echoed by Lawrence Lessig . [63] As of 1 January 2010 [update] a Public Domain Day website lists the authors whose works are entering the public domain. [64] There are activities in countries around the world by various organizations all under the banner Public Domain Day.

Open content
Open content is a neologism coined by David Wiley in 1998 [1] which describes a creative work that others can copy or modify. The term evokes the related concept of open source software . [2]

History
Originally, the Open content concept and term was evangelized via the Open Content Project by David A. Wiley in 1998, and described works licensed under the Open Content License (a non-free share-alike license, see 'Free content' below) and other works licensed under similar terms. [2]
It has since come to describe a broader class of content without conventional copyright restrictions. The openness of content can be assessed under the '5Rs Framework' based on the extent to which it can be reused, revised, remixed and redistributed by members of the public without violating copyright law. [3] Unlike open source and free content , there is no clear threshold that a work must reach to qualify as 'open content'.
Although open content has been described as a counterbalance to copyright , [4] open content licenses rely on a copyright holder's power to license their work, similarly as copyleft which also utilizes copyright for such a purpose.
In 2003 Wiley announced that the Open Content Project has been succeeded by Creative Commons and their licenses , where he joined as "Director of Educational Licenses". [5] [6]
In 2006 the Creative Commons ' successor project was the Definition of Free Cultural Works [7] for free content , put forth by Erik Möller , [8] Richard Stallman , Lawrence Lessig , Benjamin Mako Hill , [8] Angela Beesley, [8] and others. The Definition of Free Cultural Works is used by the Wikimedia Foundation . [9] In 2008, the Attribution and Attribution-ShareAlike Creative Commons licenses were marked as "Approved for Free Cultural Works" among other licenses. [10]
Another successor project is the Open Knowledge Foundation ( OKF ), [11] founded by Rufus Pollock in Cambridge , UK in 2004 [12] as a global non-profit network to promote and share open content and data. [13] In 2007 the Open Knowledge Foundation gave a Open Knowledge Definition for "Content such as music, films, books; Data be it scientific, historical, geographic or otherwise; Government and other administrative information" . [14] In October 2014 with version 2.0 Open Works and Open Licenses were defined and "open" is described as synonymous to the definitions of open/free in the Open Source Definition , the Free Software Definition and the Definition of Free Cultural Works . [15] A distinct difference is the focus given to the public domain and that it focuses also on the accessibility (" open access ") and the readability (" open formats "). Among several conformant licenses, six are recommended, three own (Open Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and Licence (PDDL), Open Data Commons Attribution License (ODC-BY), Open Data Commons Open Database License (ODbL)) and the CC BY , CC BY-SA , and CC0 creative commons licenses. [16] [17] [18]

"Open Content" definition
The OpenContent website once defined OpenContent as 'freely available for modification, use and redistribution under a license similar to those used by the Open Source / Free Software community'. [2] However, such a definition would exclude the Open Content License (OPL) because that license forbade charging 'a fee for the [OpenContent] itself', a right required by free and open source software licenses. [ citation needed ]
The term since shifted in meaning. OpenContent "is licensed in a manner that provides users with free and perpetual permission to engage in the 5R activities." [3]
The 5Rs are put forward on the OpenContent website as a framework for assessing the extent to which content is open:
This broader definition distinguishes open content from open source software, since the latter must be available for commercial use by the public. However, it is similar to several definitions for open educational resources , which include resources under noncommercial and verbatim licenses. [19] [20]
The later Open Definition by the Open Knowledge Foundation (now kown as Open Knowledge International ) define open knowledge with open content and open data as sub-elements and draws heavily on the Open Source Definition ; it preserves the limited sense of open content as free content, [21] unifying both.

Open access
" Open access " refers to toll-free or gratis access to content, consisting mainly of published peer-reviewed scholarly journal articles. Some open access works are also licensed for reuse and redistribution, which would qualify them as open content.

Open content and education
Over the past decade, open content has been used to develop alternative routes towards higher education. Traditional universities are expensive, and their tuition rates are increasing. [22] Open content allows a free way of obtaining higher education that is "focused on collective knowledge and the sharing and reuse of learning and scholarly content." [23] There are multiple projects and organizations that promote learning through open content, including OpenCourseWare Initiative , The Saylor Foundation and Khan Academy . Some universities, like MIT , Yale , and Tufts are making their courses freely available on the internet. [24]

Textbooks
The textbook industry is one of the educational industries in which open content can make the biggest impact. [25] Traditional textbooks, aside from being expensive, can also be inconvenient and out of date, because of publishers' tendency to constantly print new editions. [26] Open textbooks help to eliminate this problem, because they are online and thus easily updatable. Being openly licensed and online can be helpful to teachers, because it allows the textbook to be modified according to the teacher's unique curriculum. [25] There are multiple organizations promoting the creation of openly licensed textbooks. Some of these organizations and projects include The University of Minnesota's Open Textbook Library , Connexions , OpenStax College , The Saylor Foundation Open Textbook Challenge and Wikibooks

Licenses
According to the current definition of open content on the OpenContent website, any general, royalty-free copyright license would qualify as an open license because it 'provides users with the right to make more kinds of uses than those normally permitted under the law. These permissions are granted to users free of charge.' [3]
However, the narrower definition used in the Open Definition effectively limits open content to libre content , any free content license, defined by the Definition of Free Cultural Works , would qualify as an open content license. According to this narrower criteria, the following still-maintained licenses qualify:

The Free Software Definition
The Free Software Definition written by Richard Stallman and published by Free Software Foundation (FSF), defines free software as being software that ensures that the end users have freedom in using, studying, sharing and modifying that software. The term "free" is used in the sense of "free speech," not of "free of charge." [1] The earliest known publication of the definition was in the February 1986 edition [2] of the now-discontinued GNU's Bulletin publication of FSF. The canonical source for the document is in the philosophy section of the GNU Project website. As of April 2008 [update] , it is published there in 39 languages. [3] FSF publishes a list of licences which meet this definition .

The definition and the Four Freedoms
The definition published by FSF in February 1986 had two points: [2]
In 1996, when the gnu.org website was launched, "free software" was defined referring to "three levels of freedom" by adding an explicit mention of the freedom to study the software (which could be read in the two-point definition as being part of the freedom to change the program). [4] [5] Stallman later avoided the word "levels", saying that you need all of the freedoms, so it's misleading to think in terms of levels.
Finally, another freedom was added, to explicitly say that users should be able to run the program. The existing freedoms were already numbered one to three, but this freedom should come before the others, so it was added as "freedom zero". [6] [ better source needed ]
The modern definition defines free software by whether or not the recipient has the following four freedoms: [7]
Freedoms 1 and 3 require source code to be available because studying and modifying software without its source code is highly impractical.

Later definitions
In July 1997, Bruce Perens published the Debian Free Software Guidelines . [8] This was also used by Open Source Initiative (OSI) under the name " The Open Source Definition ", the only change being that use of the term "free software" was replaced by OSI's alternative term for free software , "open-source software".

Comparison with the Open Source Definition
Despite the philosophical differences between the free software movement and the open source movement , the official definitions of free software by the Free Software Foundation and of open source software by the Open Source Initiative basically refer to the same software licences, with a few minor exceptions. While stressing the philosophical differences, the Free Software Foundation comments:

Mashup (music)
A mashup (also mesh , mash up , mash-up , blend , bootleg [1] and bastard pop/rock ) is a song or composition created by blending two or more pre-recorded songs, usually by overlaying the vocal track of one song seamlessly over the instrumental track of another. [2] To the extent that such works are " transformative " of original content, in the United States they may find protection from copyright claims under the " fair use " doctrine of copyright law. [3]

Synonyms
Mashups are known by a number of different names:
In addition, more traditional terms such as "edits" or (unauthorized) "remixes" are favored by many " bootleggers " (also known as 'leggers). [ citation needed ]

History
The practice of assembling new songs from purloined elements of other tracks stretches back to the beginnings of recorded music. If one extends the definition beyond the realm of pop, precursors can be found in musique concrète , as well as the classical practice of (re-)arranging traditional folk material and the jazz tradition of reinterpreting standards . In addition, many elements of mashup culture have antecedents in hip hop and the DIY ethic of punk as well as overlap with the free culture movement .

Precursors

"The Flying Saucer"
In 1956, Bill Buchanan and Dickie Goodman released what they called a "break-in" song, (i.e. material from one song would "break-in" to another) called "The Flying Saucer". The track, a reinterpretation of Orson Welles ' celebrated War of the Worlds mock-emergency broadcast interspliced with musical snippets comically dramatizing the portentous patter of the announcer, spawned a raft of imitations. Goodman had several other similar hits in the 1960s and 1970s.

Novelty records
There have been a number of novelty records and one-off hits that have included uncleared samples. The song " Your Woman " by White Town features an uncredited sample from a 1932 song "My Woman" by the Lew Stone Band taken from the soundtrack of the Dennis Potter series Pennies From Heaven . Other notable one-off bootlegs include DNA 's dance remix of Suzanne Vega 's " Tom's Diner " (1990) and "You Got The Love" by The Source featuring Candi Staton (1991). Vega received quite a few unsolicited mixes of her (a cappella) song, and eventually issued an entire CD of "Tom's Diner" mixes, one notable example being "Jeannie's Diner", in which a resung verse based on Vega's composition describes the premise of the situation comedy "I Dream of Jeannie". "Tom's Diner" is likely to be the first song that was "mash mixed" as we now know the process.
One series was John Morales' (later one half of M and M productions) "Deadly Medleys", in which he mixed-up disco hits of the moment to form beat-consistent collages. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Dutch producer Jaap Eggermont produced the Stars on 45 series of records. These records attempted to cram as many hits as possible into the space of a three and a half-minute pop song, and are more accurately described as medleys. A similar series by Mirage in the late 1980s took this further by densely layering the songs on its "Jack Mix" records so that these were very close to later mashups.
Singer-producer Jonathan King anticipated the mashup genre with several novelty singles. In 1987, King accused the Pet Shop Boys of plagiarizing the melody of Cat Stevens ' " Wild World " for their song " It's A Sin ". To prove the point, King recorded a version of "Wild World" with an arrangement virtually identical to that of "It's A Sin". King performed an analogous stunt with a version of " He's So Fine " by The Chiffons arranged in the style of George Harrison 's " My Sweet Lord ", making a cheeky reference to the plagiarism suit over the similarities between the two songs.
Little Roger and the Goosebumps released their single "Gilligan's Island (Stairway)", later renamed "Stairway to Gilligan's Island" in May 1978 on their own Splash Records label. The song combines the lyrics to the theme song of the television show Gilligan's Island with the music of " Stairway to Heaven " by Led Zeppelin . Later in 1978, Damaskas and Barnes & Barnes were inspired by Little Roger and the Goosebumps to record "A Day in the Life of Green Acres," a song that combined the music of The Beatles ' " A Day in the Life " with the lyrics to the theme song of the television show Green Acres .

Frank Zappa
In the 1970s, Frank Zappa developed a technique he called " xenochrony " in which a guitar solo was extracted from its original context and placed into a completely different song. His recording engineer referred to this as "the Ampex guitar". In his rock opera Joe's Garage (1979), for example, Zappa's xenochrony can be heard on every track apart from Packard Goose .
"Rubber Shirt" from the album Sheik Yerbouti consists of a bass track and a drum track taken from two different live performances melded together in the studio.

John Oswald
John Oswald has been devising illegitimate compositions since the late 1960s. His 1975 track "Power" married frenetic Led Zeppelin guitars to the impassioned exhortations of a Southern American evangelist at the same time that hip hop was discovering the potency of the same (and related) kinds of ingredients. Similarly, his 1990 track "Vane", which pitted two different versions of the song " You're So Vain " (the Carly Simon original and a cover by Faster Pussycat ) against each other, was a blueprint for the contemporary mashup subgenre, glitch pop. Oswald coined the term " plunderphonics " to describe his illegitimate craft. In 1993, he released Plexure . Arguably his most ambitious composition to date, it attempted to microsample the history of CD music up to that point (1982–1992) in a 20-minute collage of bewildering complexity. The ambition of this piece would later be recalled by the British bootlegger Osymyso , whose " Intro-Inspection " captured the pop-junkie feel of Plexure . Osymyso, who at the time was unaware of Oswald's work, used the same structure of an accelerando (arranging his source material in order from the slowest tempo to the fastest) to link a few bars each of 100 songs, creating a simpler sound than the thousands of overlapping and morphing pop "electroquotations" in Plexure .

Pink Project
In 1982, Italo disco composer and producer Stefano Pulga, under the name Pink Project , had a substantial hit with "Disco Project", a completely re-recorded version of The Alan Parsons Project 's instrumental track "Mammagamma" (from the album Eye in the Sky ), using "Sirius" (from the same album) as an intro, and featuring the schoolchildren's choir vocals (also entirely re-recorded by female session vocalists) from Pink Floyd 's " Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2 " on top of the Parsons track. Technically more similar to a medley of cover versions (as it did not include any elements directly taken from the original records) than to a mashup, the record was nevertheless identified with the nascent genre by Italian radio DJs.

Negativland
Though Negativland are seldom acknowledged as musical antecedents of mashups, lacking perhaps the sense of fun many contemporary practitioners seek in their craft, their struggle against various forms of "censorship" (in their terms) and legal coercion (for instance, their single "U2" was one of the first pieces of music to be withdrawn for its use of unauthorised samples) has made them poster children for some mashup commentators who approach the issue from a more critical perspective, and with an eye to the complicated cultural issues raised by both accidental and deliberate plundering within music and culture generally.

The Tape-beatles
Also known as "Public Works", The Tape-beatles have used collage techniques to create works of materials appropriated from various sources.

Double Dee and Steinski
Working under the name Steinski , New York copywriter DJ Steve Stein began (in conjunction with engineer and fellow studio boffin Doug "Double Dee" DiFranco) the next chapter in the evolution of illicit pop by producing a trio of underground 12" singles (entitled "The Payoff Mix" (1983), "Lesson 2 (The James Brown Mix)" (1984) and "Lesson 3 (History of Hiphop)" (1985)) which exerted a powerful influence on an entire generation of "samplists".

John Zorn
The 1990 John Zorn album Naked City features a version of Ornette Coleman 's " Lonely Woman " set over the bassline of Roy Orbison 's " Pretty Woman ". [4]

Evolution Control Committee
In 1994, the experimental band Evolution Control Committee released the first modern mashup tracks on their hand-made cassette album, Gunderphonic . These "Whipped Cream Mixes" combined a pair of Public Enemy a cappellas with instrumentals by Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass . First released on home-made cassettes in early 1992, it was later pressed on 7" vinyl, and distributed by Eerie Materials in the mid-1990s, the tracks gained some degree of notoriety on college radio stations in the United States. [5]

Renaissance

2 Many DJs
The name Pop Will Eat Itself was taken from an NME feature on the band Jamie Wednesday , written by David Quantick , which proposed the theory that because popular music simply recycles good ideas continuously, the perfect pop song could be written by [combining] the best of those ideas into one track. Hence, Pop Will Eat Itself. [6]
The movement gained momentum again in 2001 with the release of the 2 Many DJs album, As Heard on Radio Soulwax Pt. 2 , by Soulwax 's Dewaele brothers, which combined 45 different tracks; the same year a remix of Christina Aguilera 's " Genie in a Bottle " was also released by Freelance Hellraiser , which coupled the pop star with the raucous guitars of " Hard To Explain " by New York's The Strokes in an infectious concoction entitled "A Stroke of Genie-us". [7]

Software tools
As a result of this, industry standard tools such as the digital audio workstation Cubase and the sound editors Wavelab , Soundforge and Cool Edit Pro quickly became ubiquitous. Moreover, new tools such as Ableton Live and Sonic Foundry 's (now Sony 's) ACID Pro were tweaked to accommodate the needs of this new "scene". Most notably, such features as beat-mapping (a technique that simplifies the synchronization of samples of different tempos) and online previewing (allowing the composer to audition a sample, playing at the right pitch and tempo, alongside their existing composition) made it easy for many people with musical ability but little professional studio experience to knock together new combinations in a fraction of the time it would take with traditional tools, such as the magnetic tape John Oswald (and even Coldcut ) slaved over in their early days.
Mark Vidler , known as Go Home Productions, summarized it by saying the benefits of such technology of AcidPro: "You don't need a distributor, because your distribution is the internet. You don't need a record label, because it's your bedroom, and you don't need a recording studio, because that's your computer. You do it all yourself."

Get Your Bootleg On, Mashuptown, Bootie, Boomselection, A.D.D
Around 2001–2002, the blog Boomselection [8] was launched. It publicised various challenges which resulted in hundreds, if not thousands, of new bootlegs being uploaded to sites around the world. While the scene began as a primarily British phenomenon, the U.S., France and Germany are currently the hotbeds of the modern mashup movement. However, there are notable bootleggers to be found in practically every corner of the globe – wherever an Internet connection and a record collection can be found – including Australia, Belgium, Switzerland, and Sweden.
The Get Your Bootleg on site [9] (affectionately abbreviated to GYBO) became an important launchpad for new mashup tunes, and was the home of a lively community of bootleggers who offered critiques of new songs, tips for newbies, pointers on where to find a cappellas, legal advice, publicity for mashup events and general discussion of issues surrounding the mashup phenomenon.
The name "Get Your Bootleg On" comes from the Missy Elliott track " Get Ur Freak On ", which alongside Eminem ’s " Without Me " remains perhaps the most bootlegged, manipulated, remixed and reinterpreted song from the heyday of the genre. Other popular, frequently bootlegged artists include Britney Spears , Christina Aguilera , Madonna and Beyoncé .
In early 2005, Boomselection retired itself after a long period of inactivity. The year also marked a series of cease-and-desist orders brought against a number of bootleg sites, and in early 2006 GYBO received its first such notice. To survive, the site prohibited the posting of direct links to copyrighted material within the forums, but allowed users to post links to their own sites containing such material, the defence being that now GYBO was no more in violation of copyright law than Google. For the most part, the community has rallied around the site, and continues to support it in its new form.
The void left by Boomselection's demise was rapidly replaced by Mashuptown [10] which was started in early 2005 and is currently the biggest blog source of mashups on the Internet. The site has recently become the official supplier of mashups to Adam Curry 's Daily Source Code podcast .
Also in 2005, Bootie , the biggest bootleg mashup party in the world, began its monthly Bootie Top 10 [11] where it posts for free download its ten best mashups, as selected by Bootie creators and DJs A Plus D . Launched in San Francisco in 2003, Bootie was the first club night in the United States dedicated solely to the burgeoning art form of the bootleg mashup, and now hosts monthly parties in several cities around the globe, including Los Angeles, Paris, Boston, Munich, and New York City. The party's slogan, "Music for the A.D.D. Generation" also inspired the creation of "A.D.D", Israel's first mash-up dedicated party. [12]

Bonna Music and "Enjoy the Sheket"
Legal mashups are hard to find, but in some relatively small music markets, legal mashups have been released. Some say that this is because publishers have understood the potential of clearing the rights of major international artist to be combined with local repertoires, to create a wider consumption for both artists on a given track.
In Israel, for example, a group called Bonna Music remixed the Depeche Mode song " Enjoy the Silence " with Balagan's "Sheket" ( Hebrew : שקט ‎‎; "Silence"). The mashup was approved by Martin Gore and released officially a month before Depeche Mode 's new album Playing the Angel in 2005. It was a major hit locally and when Depeche Mode's first single was released they were more welcome in a market where the local repertoire is dominant.

Good Copy Bad Copy
Good Copy Bad Copy is a 2007 documentary about the current state of copyright and culture. It has a heavy focus on the mashup community, containing interviews with Girl Talk and Danger Mouse that reveal an emerging understanding of digital works and the obstacle to their authoring copyright presents.

Glee
Mash-ups have been featured on many episodes of the popular American TV series Glee . They first appeared in the episode " Vitamin D ", which featured mashing up Bon Jovi 's " It's My Life " with Usher 's " Confessions Part II " and Beyoncé Knowles 's " Halo " with " Walking on Sunshine " by Katrina and the Waves .

DJ Hero
The 2009 video game DJ Hero brought mash-ups together with gameplay elements from the Guitar Hero series using many of the same songs that are routinely cut-up in the online remixing scene. Notably, the tracks which use musical ideas from " Bitter Sweet Symphony " credit the sample source Andrew Oldham Orchestra rather than The Verve , even though the Verve's use of the sample and the surrounding legal controversy is what popularized the frequent use of the sample in mash-ups.

RIP: A Remix Manifesto
RIP!: A Remix Manifesto is an open source documentary created by Brett Gaylor and Greg Gillis ( Girl Talk ). The film consists of a remix of clips submitted by numerous contributors to the Open Source Cinema project. It focuses in particular on the legal "grey area" of remixing existing copyrighted works.

Legal issues

Copyright Act of 1976

Fair Use Law

Subgenres

A vs B
The original manifestation of mashups in the 2000s was putting an a cappella against a completely different backing track, in order to make a "third song". Following "A Stroke of Genie-us" in 2001, the genre has continued to focus on this basic premise.
Another notable "versus" song is "Zombi – Zombie Nation " which combined Zombie Nation 's " Kernkraft 400 " with Goblin 's Zombi theme and was featured on the official soundtrack of the film Shaun of the Dead .
In addition, Go Home Productions , Party Ben and DJ BC , amongst many others, have produced a number of critically acclaimed songs in this vein, and in some instances have secured record deals on the back of these exercises, which arguably serve as "demo MP3s" of their musical and production skills.
Another example of a legitimate release on the back of an unofficial one can been seen in Illicit 's "Sneaky Armada", [13] which combined Groove Armada 's " I See You Baby " with Teddy Pendergrass 's "You Can't Hide From Yourself". This was subsequently re-played, re-vocalised and re-released on Azuli 's Yola label as "Cheeky Armada" [14] in September 2001 when it reached number 72 in the UK Singles Chart . [15] Illicit also released numerous other unofficial "versus" songs during the same period. [16]
However, not all mash-ups are as simple as A vs B. In some cases, DJs will mash 3, 4, 5, and even 6 songs to form one complete track. Mixing more than two tracks together can be a daunting task, and it requires a great deal of skill. Notably, DJ Earworm has combined the yearly top 25 songs according to Billboard into a single mashup since 2007, which has spawned similar creations from popular DJs such as Robin Skouteris or Daniel Kim. These mashups are typically uploaded to YouTube and attract a lot of attention in the pop culture world.
Girl Talk is known for his style of multi-track mashing; most of his mashups contain samples from 20–30 different tracks. Girl Talk is famous for his style of "cutting" through different songs and often building to the climax of a song, upon which the song settles into a groove before cutting away again.

Version vs Version
Mixing two or more versions of a song to create a duet or alternative version of a song is what a version vs version is set to accomplish. It can mix two different versions of a song, such as a ballad and original version, or a cover version of the song. Some of the more popular version to version mixes are language mixes, which is mixing multiple languages into one song. A slightly less popular style of this is mashing two different remixes or the original and a specific remix of a song together. Version vs Version mashups usually have the same original instrumental but sometimes it is changed to benefit the song.

Abstract Mash Ups
Music collages which refer to avant-garde music practice and Musique Concrète . These are not intended for the dance floor and are made using all types of music and sound as valid sound sources to be played simultaneously and often manipulated. Beat matching and stylistic or aesthetic similarities are not an important factor in these mash ups. Chaos, dissonance and harmony are all possible results.
An early example of this can be heard on John Cage 's multi-radio composition "Imaginary Landscapes No. 4" (1951) for 12 radios, 24 performers and a conductor. Perhaps the most famous Abstract Mash Up is The Beatles " Revolution 9 " featuring on their White Album from 1968 which includes samples of conversations, classical music and edited and manipulated samples played simultaneously. Other examples of the psychedelic nature of these mash ups can be heard on " Heart Beat, Pig Meat " by Pink Floyd from the soundtrack to the film Zabriskie Point ; " The Beatles Play the Residents and the Residents Play the Beatles " and the album The Third Reich 'n Roll by The Residents and early turntable work by Christian Marclay .
A current (2013) example of Abstract Mash Ups can be heard on radio shows by Joel Cahen ( a.k.a. 'Spax') on Resonance fm in London. The series of shows which began in 2005, feature live abstract mash ups using MP3s, turntables, CDs, DVDs and field recordings as simultaneously played sound sources. The third season of this series, Soundsoup , March 2008–April 2010, veered the style towards a more narrative based one.

Glitch pop
Glitch pop is a subgenre of the mashup scene which marries the Digital Signal Processing (DSP) wizardry associated with Kid 606 and Tigerbeat6 records to the ostensibly familiar contours of pop. Sometimes this is done in a spirit of "homage"; sometimes it serves merely as a form of ridicule and even vilification; often it is both at the same time.
An example of the "double science" at play in glitch pop is Skkatter's "Dirty Pop", which takes a song that is already an epic of carefully constructed digital micro-malfunctions ( BT 's deconstruction of *NSYNC 's "Pop") and pushes it even further out to the margins of musical mayhem. Similarly, Australian bootlegger and glitch pop co-conspirator Dsico (real name Luke Collinson) has reworked a number of R&B tunes by such artists as The Neptunes and (again) *NSYNC in a spirit that is at once both satirical and steeped in fanboydom . In most cases these remixes render ostensibly mainstream songs "avant garde" and fresh, sometimes by working against the spirit of the original, but often by leveraging the sugar rush at the heart of much of the best contemporary pop, and adding sonic CGI to its emotional armoury.
In the UK, the most notable exponent of the genre is Poj Masta , a teenage schoolboy whose work has been keenly supported by DJs such as Eddy Temple-Morris and James Hyman of London's Xfm radio station. Their weekly show, "The Remix", has played a major role in nurturing new bootleggers and bringing them to the attention of a wide audience. [17]

Audio-Viz Mash
SiX DwArF is a non-commercial mashup artist from Scotland in the UK with a twist. He creates cross-genre mashup tunes but also invents mashup promo videos to go with them which feature on Mash TV, hosted on Veetle and on various video hosting sites. SiX DwArF also creates homemade promos to champion songs that do not already have one in which he feels deserves it, receiving praise from various artists. His modus operandi is: "There's no campaigns, zero commercial gain, no vested interests. Nothing is sacred. Don't do genre... it's stereotype by another name." [ citation needed ]

Remixes
Technically, all mashups are remixes . But while most are made up entirely of plundered material, some bootleggers have fused old a cappella tracks with completely new compositions of their own device. An example of popular remix artists that primarily remixes single songs but also mashes songs are The White Pandas. The Chicago-based duo has emerged as one of the biggest upcoming DJs.
Another popular example with fans of Japanese pop is Evil Morning , an album which combines vocal tracks from Morning Musume and their associated artists with new instrumental tracks that rearrange or replay the original music in the style of hard rock or heavy metal .

Bootleg albums
DJ Danger Mouse 's critically acclaimed remix project The Grey Album effectively launched a new pop subgenre. While The Beatles had made appearances on several mash-up tracks prior to this album (for instance PPM's "A Life in the Day" and JPL's "Let It Be Missy Elliott (Beatlesmix)"), The Grey Album distinguished itself by being made up entirely of samples from The Beatles' White Album and vocals from Jay-Z 's The Black Album . The project received considerable attention following EMI 's legal threats towards distributors of the album. [18]
Another album is Jon Moskowitz Presents Blue Eyes Meets Bed-Stuy , produced by DJ Cappel & Smitty (2005). This is a remix/mash-up album of The Notorious B.I.G. and Frank Sinatra . The project was very well received, with major online and print coverage. It was conceived and executive produced by Jon Moskowitz. DJ Cappel and Smitty took The Notorious B.I.G.'s a cappellas and remixed them with notable Frank Sinatra songs, by contributing Sinatra's solos, hooks and choruses. [ citation needed ]
The Best of Bootie mashup compilation series is compiled and produced each year by A Plus D , creators of the international mashup club Bootie . The compilations have been released in December every year since 2005, and are annual Internet sensations, with each album garnering over 5000GB+ of downloads. [19]

Cut-ups
While there is some overlap between the terms "cut up" and "mash up", the former has increasingly come to refer to pieces that rely on the humour (or pathos) of reconstructed spoken word and video material. This may be due to the fact that the term "cut up" was used decades earlier by novelist and artist William S. Burroughs to refer to his literary cutups as well as his tape recorder experiments, which featured spliced vocal tracks in the same way that his written cut-ups literally cut up and rearranged various texts.
The best known cutups remix political speeches and rallies to satirical effect. Simon Hunt, under the pseudonym Pauline Pantsdown used the speeches of Pauline Hanson , an anti-immigration, controversial Australian politician to parodic effect in the songs I Don't Like It and Backdoor Man . Johan Söderberg's "Endless Love", in which George W. Bush and Tony Blair appear to serenade each other like lovebirds, Chris Morris ' " Bushwhacked ", a détournement of Bush's 2003 State of the Union Address , or Sarkoskanking by Polémix and La Voix Off, a cut-off of Nicolas Sarkozy 's speeches.
Notable cut up artists include Cassetteboy , Osymyso , rx , Cartel Communique and Evolution Control Committee .

Notable mash-up artists

Girl Talk
One of the most well known artists in the mashup industry is Gregg Michael Gillis, otherwise known as Girl Talk . He studied engineering in college and then quit the industry in 2007 in order to focus solely on his music career. He is originally from Pittsburgh, PA and is one of many artists under the record label, Illegal Art , which specializes in music sampling. Other artists with Illegal Art include Junk Culture and People Like Us. Girl Talk has released five albums with Illegal Art: Secret Diary , Unstoppable , Night Ripper , Feed the Animals , and All Day . Girl Talk does not believe that they are violating any factor of the Fair Use Laws as the law does not specify for mashups and remixes and the length of the song that is used. Thus, Girl Talk feels that they should not have to pay the sustained artists a fee for the work they are using. However, others feel that Girl Talk is violating the Fair Use Law and should be penalized.

Digital library
A digital library is a special library with a focused collection of digital objects that can include text, visual material, audio material, video material, stored as electronic media formats (as opposed to print , microform , or other media), along with means for organizing, storing, and retrieving the files and media contained in the library collection. Digital libraries can vary immensely in size and scope, and can be maintained by individuals, organizations, or affiliated with established physical library buildings or institutions, or with academic institutions. [1] The digital content may be stored locally, or accessed remotely via computer networks. An electronic library is a type of information retrieval system.

Software implementation
Institutional repository software is designed for archiving, organizing, and searching a library's content. Popular open-source solutions include DSpace , EPrints , Digital Commons , and Fedora Commons -based systems Islandora and Hydra . [2]

History
Early projects centered on the creation of an electronic card catalogue known as Online Public Access Catalog (OPAC). By the 1980s, the success of these endeavors resulted in OPAC replacing the traditional card catalog in many academic, public and special libraries. This permitted libraries to undertake additional rewarding co-operative efforts to support resource sharing and expand access to library materials beyond an individual library.
An early example of a digital library is the Education Resources Information Center (ERIC) which was "born digital" in 1966. [3]

Terminology
The term digital libraries was first popularized by the NSF / DARPA / NASA Digital Libraries Initiative in 1994. [4] These draw heavily on Vannevar Bush 's essay As We May Think (1945), which set out a vision not in terms of technology, but user experience. The term virtual library was initially used interchangeably with digital library, but is now primarily used for libraries that are virtual in other senses (such as libraries which aggregate distributed content). In the early days of digital libraries, there was discussion of the similarities and differences among the terms digital , virtual , and electronic . [5]
In the context of the DELOS, a Network of Excellence on Digital Libraries, and DL.org, a Coordination Action on Digital Library Interoperability, Best Practices and Modelling Foundations , Digital Library researchers and practitioners and software developer produced a Digital Library Reference Model [6] [7] which defines a digital library as: "A potentially virtual organization, that comprehensively collects, manages and preserves for the long depth of time rich digital content, and offers to its targeted user communities specialized functionality on that content, of defined quality and according to comprehensive codified policies." [8]
A distinction is often made between content that was created in a digital format, known as born-digital , and information that has been converted from a physical medium, e.g. paper, through digitization . It should also be noted that not all electronic content is in digital data format. The term hybrid library is sometimes used for libraries that have both physical collections and electronic collections. For example, American Memory is a digital library within the Library of Congress .
Some important digital libraries also serve as long term archives, such as arXiv and the Internet Archive . Others, such as the Digital Public Library of America , seek to make digital information from various institutions widely accessible online. [9]

Academic repositories
Many academic libraries are actively involved in building institutional repositories of the institution's books, papers, theses, and other works which can be digitized or were 'born digital'. Many of these repositories are made available to the general public with few restrictions, in accordance with the goals of open access , in contrast to the publication of research in commercial journals, where the publishers often limit access rights. Institutional, truly free, and corporate repositories are sometimes referred to as digital libraries.

Digital archives
Physical archives differ from physical libraries in several ways. Traditionally, archives are defined as:
The technology used to create digital libraries is even more revolutionary for archives since it breaks down the second and third of these general rules. In other words, "digital archives" or "online archives" will still generally contain primary sources, but they are likely to be described individually rather than (or in addition to) in groups or collections. Further, because they are digital, their contents are easily reproducible and may indeed have been reproduced from elsewhere. The Oxford Text Archive is generally considered to be the oldest digital archive of academic physical primary source materials.
Archives differ from libraries in the nature of the materials held. Libraries collect individual published books and serials, or bounded sets of individual items. The books and journals held by libraries are not unique, since multiple copies exist and any given copy will generally prove as satisfactory as any other copy. The material in archives and manuscript libraries are "the unique records of corporate bodies and the papers of individuals and families". [10]
A fundamental characteristic of archives is that they have to keep the context in which their records have been created and the network of relationships between them in order to preserve their informative content and provide understandable and useful information over time. The fundamental characteristic of archives resides in their hierarchical organization expressing the context by means of the archival bond . Archival descriptions are the fundamental means to describe, understand, retrieve and access archival material. At the digital level, archival descriptions are usually encoded by means of the Encoded Archival Description XML format. The EAD is a standardized electronic representation of archival description which makes it possible to provide union access to detailed archival descriptions and resources in repositories distributed throughout the world.
Digital libraries benefit from the existence of sophisticated formal models, such as The 5S Framework: Streams, Structures, Spaces, Scenarios and Societies , [11] which allow us to formally describe them and to prove their properties and features.
Given the importance of archives, a dedicated formal model, called NEsted SeTs for Object Hierarchies (NESTOR) , [12] built around their peculiar constituents, has been defined. NESTOR is based on the idea of expressing the hierarchical relationships between objects through the inclusion property between sets, in contrast to the binary relation between nodes exploited by the tree. NESTOR has been used to formally extend the 5S model to define a digital archive as a specific case of digital library able to take into consideration the peculiar features of archives.

The future
Large scale digitization projects are underway at Google , the Million Book Project , and Internet Archive. With continued improvements in book handling and presentation technologies such as optical character recognition and development of alternative depositories and business models, digital libraries are rapidly growing in popularity. Just as libraries have ventured into audio and video collections, so have digital libraries such as the Internet Archive. Google Books project recently received a court victory on proceeding with their book-scanning project that was halted by the Authors' guild. This helped open the road for libraries to work with Google to better reach patrons who are accustomed to computerized information.
According to Larry Lannom, Director of Information Management Technology at the nonprofit Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI), "all the problems associated with digital libraries are wrapped up in archiving." He goes on to state, "If in 100 years people can still read your article, we'll have solved the problem." Daniel Akst, author of The Webster Chronicle, proposes that "the future of libraries — and of information — is digital." Peter Lyman and Hal Variant, information scientists at the University of California, Berkeley , estimate that "the world's total yearly production of print, film, optical, and magnetic content would require roughly 1.5 billion gigabytes of storage." Therefore, they believe that "soon it will be technologically possible for an average person to access virtually all recorded information." [13]

Searching
Most digital libraries provide a search interface which allows resources to be found. These resources are typically deep web (or invisible web) resources since they frequently cannot be located by search engine crawlers . Some digital libraries create special pages or sitemaps to allow search engines to find all their resources. Digital libraries frequently use the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH) to expose their metadata to other digital libraries, and search engines like Google Scholar , Yahoo! and Scirus can also use OAI-PMH to find these deep web resources. [14]
There are two general strategies for searching a federation of digital libraries: distributed searching and searching previously harvested metadata .
Distributed searching typically involves a client sending multiple search requests in parallel to a number of servers in the federation. The results are gathered, duplicates are eliminated or clustered, and the remaining items are sorted and presented back to the client. Protocols like Z39.50 are frequently used in distributed searching. A benefit to this approach is that the resource-intensive tasks of indexing and storage are left to the respective servers in the federation. A drawback to this approach is that the search mechanism is limited by the different indexing and ranking capabilities of each database; therefore, making it difficult to assemble a combined result consisting of the most relevant found items.
Searching over previously harvested metadata involves searching a locally stored index of information that has previously been collected from the libraries in the federation. When a search is performed, the search mechanism does not need to make connections with the digital libraries it is searching - it already has a local representation of the information. This approach requires the creation of an indexing and harvesting mechanism which operates regularly, connecting to all the digital libraries and querying the whole collection in order to discover new and updated resources. OAI-PMH is frequently used by digital libraries for allowing metadata to be harvested. A benefit to this approach is that the search mechanism has full control over indexing and ranking algorithms, possibly allowing more consistent results. A drawback is that harvesting and indexing systems are more resource-intensive and therefore expensive.

Software
There are a number of software packages for use in general digital libraries, for notable ones see Digital library software . Institutional repository software, which focuses primarily on ingest, preservation and access of locally produced documents, particularly locally produced academic outputs, can be found in Institutional repository software . This software may be proprietary, as is the case with the Library of Congress which uses Digiboard and CTS to manage digital content. [15]

Digitization
In the past few years, procedures for digitizing books at high speed and comparatively low cost have improved considerably with the result that it is now possible to digitize millions of books per year. [16] Google book-scanning project is also working with libraries to offer digitize books pushing forward on the digitize book realm.

Recommendation-Systems
Many digital libraries offer recommender systems to reduce information overload and help their users discovering relevant literature. Some examples of digital libraries offering recommender systems are IEEE Xplore , Europeana , and GESIS Sowiport . The recommender systems work mostly based on content-based filtering but also other approaches are used such as collaborative filtering and citation-based recommendations. [17] Beel et al. report that there are more than 90 different recommendation approaches for digital libraries, presented in more than 200 research articles . [17]
Typically, digital libraries develop and maintain their own recommender systems based on existing search and recommendation frameworks such as Apache Lucene or Apache Mahout . However, there are also some recommendation-as-a-service provider specializing in offering a recommender system for digital libraries as a service .

Advantages
The advantages of digital libraries as a means of easily and rapidly accessing books, archives and images of various types are now widely recognized by commercial interests and public bodies alike. [18]
Traditional libraries are limited by storage space; digital libraries have the potential to store much more information, simply because digital information requires very little physical space to contain it. [19] As such, the cost of maintaining a digital library can be much lower than that of a traditional library. A physical library must spend large sums of money paying for staff, book maintenance, rent, and additional books. Digital libraries may reduce or, in some instances, do away with these fees. Both types of library require cataloging input to allow users to locate and retrieve material. Digital libraries may be more willing to adopt innovations in technology providing users with improvements in electronic and audio book technology as well as presenting new forms of communication such as wikis and blogs; conventional libraries may consider that providing online access to their OP AC catalog is sufficient. An important advantage to digital conversion is increased accessibility to users. They also increase availability to individuals who may not be traditional patrons of a library, due to geographic location or organizational affiliation.

Digital preservation
Digital preservation aims to ensure that digital media and information systems are still interpretable into the indefinite future. [21] [22] Each necessary component of this must be migrated, preserved or emulated . [23] Typically lower levels of systems ( floppy disks for example) are emulated, bit-streams (the actual files stored in the disks) are preserved and operating systems are emulated as a virtual machine . Only where the meaning and content of digital media and information systems are well understood is migration possible, as is the case for office documents. [23] [24] [25] However, at least one organization, the Wider Net Project , has created an offline digital library, the eGranary , by reproducing materials on a 6 TB hard drive . Instead of a bit-stream environment, the digital library contains a built-in proxy server and search engine so the digital materials can be accessed using an Internet browser . [26] Also, the materials are not preserved for the future. The eGranary is intended for use in places or situations where Internet connectivity is very slow, non-existent, unreliable, unsuitable or too expensive.

Copyright and licensing
Digital libraries are hampered by copyright law because, unlike with traditional printed works, the laws of digital copyright are still being formed. The republication of material on the web by libraries may require permission from rights holders, and there is a conflict of interest between libraries and the publishers who may wish to create online versions of their acquired content for commercial purposes. In 2010, it was estimated that twenty-three percent of books in existence were created before 1923 and thus out of copyright. Of those printed after this date, only five percent were still in print as of 2010. Thus, approximately seventy-two percent of books were not available to the public. [27]
There is a dilution of responsibility that occurs as a result of the distributed nature of digital resources. Complex intellectual property matters may become involved since digital material is not always owned by a library. [28] The content is, in many cases, public domain or self-generated content only. Some digital libraries, such as Project Gutenberg , work to digitize out-of-copyright works and make them freely available to the public. An estimate of the number of distinct books still existent in library catalogues from 2000 BC to 1960, has been made. [29] [30]
The Fair Use Provisions (17 USC § 107) under the Copyright Act of 1976 provide specific guidelines under which circumstances libraries are allowed to copy digital resources. Four factors that constitute fair use are "Purpose of the use, Nature of the work, Amount or substantiality used and Market impact." [31]
Some digital libraries acquire a license to lend their resources. This may involve the restriction of lending out only one copy at a time for each license, and applying a system of digital rights management for this purpose (see also above).
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 was an act created in the United States to attempt to deal with the introduction of digital works. This Act incorporates two treaties from the year 1996. It criminalizes the attempt to circumvent measures which limit access to copyrighted materials. It also criminalizes the act of attempting to circumvent access control. [32] This act provides an exemption for nonprofit libraries and archives which allows up to three copies to be made, one of which may be digital. This may not be made public or distributed on the web, however. Further, it allows libraries and archives to copy a work if its format becomes obsolete. [33]
Copyright issues persist. As such, proposals have been put forward suggesting that digital libraries be exempt from copyright law. Although this would be very beneficial to the public, it may have a negative economic effect and authors may be less inclined to create new works. [34]
Another issue that complicates matters is the desire of some publishing houses to restrict the use of digit materials such as e-books purchased by libraries. Whereas with printed books, the library owns the book until it can no longer be circulated, publishers want to limit the number of times an e-book can be checked out before the library would need to repurchase that book. "[HarperCollins] began licensing use of each e-book copy for a maximum of 26 loans. This affects only the most popular titles and has no practical effect on others. After the limit is reached, the library can repurchase access rights at a lower cost than the original price." [35] While from a publishing perspective, this sounds like a good balance of library lending and protecting themselves from a feared decrease in book sales, libraries are not set up to monitor their collections as such. They acknowledge the increased demand of digital materials available to patrons and the desire of a digital library to become expanded to include best sellers, but publisher licensing may hinder the process...

Metadata creation
In traditional libraries, the ability to find works of interest is directly related to how well they were cataloged. While cataloging electronic works digitized from a library's existing holding may be as simple as copying or moving a record from the print to the electronic form, complex and born-digital works require substantially more effort. To handle the growing volume of electronic publications, new tools and technologies have to be designed to allow effective automated semantic classification and searching. While full text search can be used for some items, there are many common catalog searches which cannot be performed using full text, including:

Disadvantages
Digital libraries, or at least their digital collections, unfortunately also have brought their own problems and challenges in areas such as: [36]
There are many large scale digitisation projects that perpetuate these problems.

Free and open-source software
Free and open-source software ( FOSS ) is computer software that can be classified as both free software and open-source software . [a] That is, anyone is freely licensed to use, copy, study, and change the software in any way, and the source code is openly shared so that people are encouraged to voluntarily improve the design of the software. [3] This is in contrast to proprietary software , where the software is under restrictive copyright and the source code is usually hidden from the users.
The benefits of using FOSS can include decreasing software costs, increasing security and stability (especially in regard to malware ), protecting privacy , and giving users more control over their own hardware. Free, open-source operating systems such as Linux and descendents of BSD are widely utilized today, powering millions of servers , desktops , smartphones (e.g. Android ), and other devices. [4] [5] Free software licenses and open-source licenses are used by many software packages .

History
.
In the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s to 1980s, it was common for computer users to have the source code for all programs they used, and the permission and ability to modify it for their own use. Software , including source code, was commonly shared by individuals who used computers. Most companies had a business model based on hardware sales, and provided or bundled software with hardware, free of charge. [ citation needed ] Organizations of users and suppliers were formed to facilitate the exchange of software; see, for example, SHARE and DECUS .
By the late 1960s, the prevailing business model around software was changing. A growing and evolving software industry was competing with the hardware manufacturer's bundled software products; rather than funding software development from hardware revenue, these new companies were selling software directly. Leased machines required software support while providing no revenue for software, and some customers able to better meet their own needs did not want the costs of software bundled with hardware product costs. In United States vs. IBM , filed 17 January 1969, the government charged that bundled software was anticompetitive. [6] While some software might always be free, there would be a growing amount of software that was for sale only. In the 1970s and early 1980s, some parts of the software industry began using technical measures (such as only distributing binary copies of computer programs ) to prevent computer users from being able to use reverse engineering techniques to study and customize software they had paid for. In 1980, the copyright law was extended to computer programs in the United States [7] —previously, computer programs could be considered ideas, procedures, methods, systems, and processes, which are not copyrightable. [8] [9]
In 1983, Richard Stallman , longtime member of the hacker community at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory , announced the GNU project , saying that he had become frustrated with the effects of the change in culture of the computer industry and its users. [10] Software development for the GNU operating system began in January 1984, and the Free Software Foundation (FSF) was founded in October 1985. An article outlining the project and its goals was published in March 1985 titled the GNU Manifesto . The manifesto included significant explanation of the GNU philosophy, Free Software Definition and " copyleft " ideas.
The Linux kernel , started by Linus Torvalds , was released as freely modifiable source code in 1991. Initially, Linux was not released under a free or open-source software license. However, with version 0.12 in February 1992, he relicensed the project under the GNU General Public License . [11] Much like Unix, Torvalds' kernel attracted the attention of volunteer programmers. [ citation needed ]
FreeBSD and NetBSD (both derived from 386BSD ) were released as free software when the USL v. BSDi lawsuit was settled out of court in 1993. OpenBSD forked from NetBSD in 1995. Also in 1995, The Apache HTTP Server , commonly referred to as Apache, was released under the Apache License 1.0 .
In 1997, Eric Raymond published The Cathedral and the Bazaar , a reflective analysis of the hacker community and free software principles. The paper received significant attention in early 1998, and was one factor in motivating Netscape Communications Corporation to release their popular Netscape Communicator Internet suite as free software . This code is today better known as Mozilla Firefox and Thunderbird .
Netscape's act prompted Raymond and others to look into how to bring the FSF's free software ideas and perceived benefits to the commercial software industry. They concluded that FSF's social activism was not appealing to companies like Netscape, and looked for a way to rebrand the free software movement to emphasize the business potential of sharing and collaborating on software source code. The new name they chose was "open source", and quickly Bruce Perens , publisher Tim O'Reilly , Linus Torvalds , and others signed on to the rebranding. The Open Source Initiative was founded in February 1998 to encourage use of the new term and evangelize open-source principles. [12]
While the Open Source Initiative sought to encourage the use of the new term and evangelize the principles it adhered to, commercial software vendors found themselves increasingly threatened by the concept of freely distributed software and universal access to an application's source code . A Microsoft executive publicly stated in 2001 that "open source is an intellectual property destroyer. I can't imagine something that could be worse than this for the software business and the intellectual-property business." [13] This view perfectly summarizes the initial response to FOSS by some software corporations. [ citation needed ] However, while FOSS has historically played a role outside of the mainstream of private software development, companies as large as Microsoft have begun to develop official open-source presences on the Internet. IBM, Oracle, Google and State Farm are just a few of the companies with a serious public stake in today's competitive open-source market. There has been a significant shift in the corporate philosophy concerning the development of free and open-source software (FOSS). [14]

GPLv3 controversy
While copyright is the primary legal mechanism that FOSS authors use to ensure license compliance for their software, other mechanisms such as legislation, patents, and trademarks have implications as well. In response to legal issues with patents and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), the Free Software Foundation released version 3 of its GNU Public License in 2007 that explicitly addressed the DMCA and patent rights.
After the development of the GNU GPLv3 in 2007, the FSF (as copyright holder of many pieces of the GNU system) updated many [ citation needed ] of the GNU programs' licenses from GPLv2 to GPLv3. On the other hand, the adoption of the new GPL version was heavily discussed in the FOSS ecosystem, [15] several projects decided against upgrading. For instance the linux kernel , [16] [17] the BusyBox [18] [19] project, AdvFS , [20] Blender , [21] and as also the VLC media player decided against adopting the GPLv3. [22]
Apple , a user of GCC and a heavy user of both DRM and patents, switched the compiler in its Xcode IDE from GCC to Clang , which is another FOSS compiler [23] but is under a permissive license . [24] LWN speculated that Apple was motivated partly by a desire to avoid GPLv3. [23] The Samba project also switched to GPLv3, so Apple replaced Samba in their software suite by a closed-source, proprietary software alternative. [25]

Commercial ownership of open-source software
Mergers have affected major open-source software. Sun Microsystems (Sun) acquired MySQL AB , owner of the popular open-source MySQL database, in 2008. [26]
Oracle in turn purchased Sun in January, 2010, acquiring their copyrights, patents, and trademarks. Thus, Oracle became the owner of both the most popular proprietary database and the most popular open-source database. Oracle's attempts to commercialize the open-source MySQL database have raised concerns in the FOSS community. [27] Partly in response to uncertainty about the future of MySQL, the FOSS community forked the project into new database systems outside of Oracle's control. These include MariaDB , Percona , and Drizzle . [28] All of these have distinct names; they are distinct projects and can not use the trademarked name MySQL. [29]

Legal cases

Oracle v. Google
In August, 2010, Oracle sued Google , claiming that its use of Java in Android infringed on Oracle's copyrights and patents. The Oracle v. Google case ended in May 2012, with the finding that Google did not infringe on Oracle's patents, and the trial judge ruled that the structure of the Java APIs used by Google was not copyrightable. The jury found that Google infringed a small number of copied files, but the parties stipulated that Google would pay no damages. [30] Oracle appealed to the Federal Circuit , and Google filed a cross-appeal on the literal copying claim. [31] Oracle won the appeal, but Google won a subsequent retrial in 2016. [ citation needed ]

Overview
Free and open source software is an umbrella term for software that is either free software , open source software , or as is often the case, both. In practice, free and open source software is usually provided free of charge, allows the user to inspect the source code, and provides a relatively high level of control of the software's function compared to proprietary software .
There is little practical distinction between the two terms, as the primary license difference between free software and open source is one of philosophy. According to the Free Software Foundation, "Nearly all open source software is free software. The two terms describe almost the same category of software, but they stand for views based on fundamentally different values." [32] Thus, the Open Source Initiative considers many free software licenses to also be open-source. These include the latest versions of the FSF's three main licenses: the GPL, the Lesser General Public License (LGPL), and the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL). [33] Thus, terminology of free and open source software is intended to be neutral on these philosophical disagreements.
There are a number of related terms and abbreviations for free and open source software (FOSS or F/OSS) or free/libre and open source software (FLOSS). (see: Alternative terms for free software )

Free software
Richard Stallman's Free Software Definition , adopted by the Free Software Foundation (FSF), defines free software as a matter of liberty, not price. [34] The earliest known publication of the definition of his free software idea was in the February 1986 edition [35] of the FSF's now-discontinued GNU's Bulletin publication. The canonical source for the document is in the philosophy section of the GNU Project website. As of April 2008, it is published there in 39 languages. [36]

Open source
The Open Source Definition is used by the Open Source Initiative to determine whether a software license qualifies for the organization's insignia for open-source software . The definition was based on the Debian Free Software Guidelines , written and adapted primarily by Bruce Perens . [37] [38] Perens did not base his writing on the four freedoms of free software from the Free Software Foundation , which were only later available on the web. [39] Perens later stated that he felt Eric Raymond's promotion of open source unfairly overshadowed the Free Software Foundation's efforts and reaffirmed his support for free software. [40] In the following 2000s he spoke about Open source again. [41] [42]

Adoption

Adoption by governments
The Government of Kerala , India, announced its official support for free/open-source software in its State IT Policy of 2001, [45] [ discuss ] which was formulated after the first-ever free software conference in India, Freedom First! , held in July 2001 in Trivandrum, the capital of Kerala. In 2009, Government of Kerala started the International Centre for Free and Open Source Software ( ICFOSS ). [46] In March 2015 the Indian government announced a policy on adoption of open source software. [47] [48]
In the German City of Munich , conversion of 15,000 PCs and laptops from Microsoft Windows-based operating systems to a Debian -based Linux environment called LiMux spanned the ten years of 2003 to 2013. After successful completion of the project, more than 80% of all computers were running Linux. [49]
In 2004, a law in Venezuela (Decree 3390) went into effect, mandating a two-year transition to open source in all public agencies. As of June 2009, this ambitious transition was still under way. [50] [51] Malaysia launched the "Malaysian Public Sector Open Source Software Program", saving millions on proprietary software licenses until 2008. [52] [53]
In 2005 the Government of Peru voted to adopt open source across all its bodies. [54] The 2002 response to Microsoft's critique is available online. In the preamble to the bill, the Peruvian government stressed that the choice was made to ensure that key pillars of democracy were safeguarded: "The basic principles which inspire the Bill are linked to the basic guarantees of a state of law." [55] In September, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts announced its formal adoption of the OpenDocument standard for all Commonwealth entities. [56]
In 2006, the Brazilian government has simultaneously encouraged the distribution of cheap computers running Linux throughout its poorer communities by subsidizing their purchase with tax breaks. [56]
In April 2008, [57] Ecuador passed a similar law, Decree 1014, designed to migrate the public sector to Libre Software. [58]
In February 2009, the United States White House moved its website to Linux servers using Drupal for content management. [59]
In March 2009, the French Gendarmerie Nationale announced it will totally switch to Ubuntu by 2015. The Gendarmerie began its transition to open source software in 2005 when it replaced Microsoft Office with OpenOffice.org across the entire organization. [60]
In January 2010, the Government of Jordan announced a partnership with Ingres Corporation (now named Actian), an open source database management company based in the United States, to promote open-source software use, starting with university systems in Jordan. [61]
In September 2014, the Uganda National Information Technology Authority (NITA-U) announced a call for feedback on an Open Source Strategy & Policy [62] at a workshop in conjunction with the ICT Association of Uganda (ICTAU).
In August 2016, the United States government announced a new federal source code policy which mandates that at least 20% of custom source code developed by or for any agency of the federal government be released as open-source software (OSS). [63] In addition, the policy requires that all source code be shared between agencies. The public release is under a three-year pilot program and agencies are obliged to collect data on this pilot to gauge its performance. The overall policy aims to reduce duplication, avoid vendor 'lock-in', and stimulate collaborative development. A new website code .gov provides "an online collection of tools, best practices, and schemas to help agencies implement this policy", the policy announcement stated. It also provides the "primary discoverability portal for custom-developed software intended both for Government-wide reuse and for release as OSS". [63] As yet unspecified OSS licenses will be added to the code. [64]
In 2017, the European Commission stated that «EU institutions should become open source software users themselves, even more than they already are» and listed open source software as one of the nine key drivers of innovation, together with big data , mobility, cloud computing and the internet of things . [65]

FOSS and Benkler's new economy
According to Yochai Benkler , Jack N. and Lillian R. Berkman Professor for Entrepreneurial Legal Studies at Harvard Law School , free software is the most visible part of a new economy of commons-based peer production of information, knowledge, and culture. As examples, he cites a variety of FOSS projects, including both free software and open-source. [66]
This new economy is already under development. To commercialize FOSS, many companies move towards advertisement-supported software. In such a model, the only way to increase revenue is to make the advertisement more valuable. Facebook was criticized in 2011 for using novel methods of tracking users to accomplish this. [67]
This new economy has alternatives. Apple's App Stores have proven very popular with both users and developers. The Free Software Foundation considers Apple's App Stores to be incompatible with its GPL and complained that Apple was infringing on the GPL with its iTunes terms of use. Rather than change those terms to comply with the GPL, Apple removed the GPL-licensed products from its App Stores. [68]

Mobile telephony
Mobile telephony is the provision of telephone services to phones which may move around freely rather than stay fixed in one location. Mobile phones connect to a terrestrial cellular network of base stations ( cell sites ), whereas satellite phones connect to orbiting satellites . Both networks are interconnected to the public switched telephone network ( PSTN ) to allow any phone in the world to be dialed.
In 2010 there were estimated to be five billion mobile cellular subscriptions in the world .

History
According to internal memos, American Telephone & Telegraph discussed developing a wireless phone in 1915, but were afraid that deployment of the technology could undermine its monopoly on wired service in the U.S. [1]
Public mobile phone systems were first introduced in the years after the Second World War and made use of technology developed before and during the conflict. The first system opened in St Louis, Missouri, USA in 1946 whilst other countries followed in the succeeding decades. The UK introduced its 'System 1' manual radiotelephone service as the South Lancashire Radiophone Service in 1958. [2] Calls were made via an operator using handsets identical to ordinary phone handsets. [3] The phone itself was a large box located in the boot (trunk) of the vehicle containing valves and other early electronic components. Although an uprated manual service ('System 3') was extended to cover most of the UK, automation did not arrive until 1981 with 'System 4'. Although this non-cellular service, based on German B-Netz technology, was expanded rapidly throughout the UK between 1982 and 1985 and continued in operation for several years before finally closing in Scotland, it was overtaken by the introduction in January 1985 of two cellular systems - the British Telecom/Securicor 'Cellnet' service and the Racal/Millicom/Barclays 'Vodafone' (from voice + data + phone) service. These cellular systems were based on US Advanced Mobile Phone Service (AMPS) technology, the modified technology being named Total Access Communication System (TACS).
In 1947 Bell Labs was the first to propose a cellular radio telephone network. The primary innovation was the development of a network of small overlapping cell sites supported by a call switching infrastructure that tracks users as they move through a network and passes their calls from one site to another without dropping the connection. In 1956 the MTA system was launched in Sweden. The early efforts to develop mobile telephony faced two significant challenges: allowing a great number of callers to use the comparatively few available frequencies simultaneously and allowing users to seamlessly move from one area to another without having their calls dropped. Both problems were solved by Bell Labs employee Amos Joel who, in 1970 applied for a patent for a mobile communications system. [4] However, a business consulting firm calculated the entire U.S. market for mobile telephones at 100,000 units and the entire worldwide market at no more than 200,000 units based on the ready availability of pay telephones and the high cost of constructing cell towers. As a consequence, Bell Labs concluded that the invention was "of little or no consequence," leading it not to attempt to commercialize the invention. The invention earned Joel induction into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2008. [5] The first call on a handheld mobile phone was made on April 3, 1973 by Martin Cooper, then of Motorola [6] to his opposite number in Bell Labs who were also racing to be first. Bell Labs went on to install the first trial cellular network in Chicago in 1978. This trial system was licensed by the FCC to ATT for commercial use in 1982 and, as part of the divestiture arrangements for the breakup of ATT, the AMPS technology was distributed to local telcos. The first commercial system opened in Chicago in October 1983. [7] [8] A system designed by Motorola also operated in the Washington D.C./Baltimore area from summer 1982 and became a full public service later the following year. [9] Japan's first commercial radiotelephony service was launched by NTT in 1978.
The first fully automatic first generation cellular system was the Nordic Mobile Telephone (NMT) system, simultaneously launched in 1981 in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. [10] NMT was the first mobile phone network featuring international roaming . The Swedish electrical engineer Östen Mäkitalo started to work on this vision in 1966, and is considered as the father of the NMT system and some consider him also the father of the cellular phone. [11] [12]
The advent of cellular technology encouraged European countries to co-operate in the development of a pan-European cellular technology to rival those of the US and Japan. This resulted in the GSM system, the initials originally from the Groupe Spécial Mobile that was charged with the specification and development tasks but latterly as the 'Global System for Mobile Communications'. The GSM standard eventually spread outside Europe and is now the most widely used cellular technology in the world and the de facto standard. The industry association, the GSMA, now represents 219 countries and nearly 800 mobile network operators. [13] There are now estimated to be over 5 billion phone subscriptions according to the " List of countries by number of mobile phones in use " (although some users have multiple subscriptions, or inactive subscriptions), which also makes the mobile phone the most widely spread technology and the most common electronic device in the world. [14]
The first mobile phone to enable internet connectivity and wireless email, the Nokia Communicator , was released in 1996, creating a new category of multi-use devices called smartphones. In 1999 the first mobile internet service was launched by NTT DoCoMo in Japan under the i-Mode service. By 2007 over 798 million people around the world accessed the internet or equivalent mobile internet services such as WAP and i-Mode at least occasionally using a mobile phone rather than a personal computer.

Cellular systems
Mobile phones send and receive radio signals with any number of cell site base stations fitted with microwave antennas . These sites are usually mounted on a tower, pole or building, located throughout populated areas, then connected to a cabled communication network and switching system. The phones have a low-power transceiver that transmits voice and data to the nearest cell sites, normally not more than 8 to 13 km (approximately 5 to 8 miles) away. In areas of low coverage , a cellular repeater may be used, which uses a long distance high-gain dish antenna or yagi antenna to communicate with a cell tower far outside of normal range, and a repeater to rebroadcast on a small short-range local antenna that allows any cellphone within a few meters to function properly.
When the mobile phone or data device is turned on, it registers with the mobile telephone exchange , or switch, with its unique identifiers, and can then be alerted by the mobile switch when there is an incoming telephone call. The handset constantly listens for the strongest signal being received from the surrounding base stations, and is able to switch seamlessly between sites. As the user moves around the network, the " handoffs " are performed to allow the device to switch sites without interrupting the call.
Cell sites have relatively low-power (often only one or two watts) radio transmitters which broadcast their presence and relay communications between the mobile handsets and the switch. The switch in turn connects the call to another subscriber of the same wireless service provider or to the public telephone network , which includes the networks of other wireless carriers. Many of these sites are camouflaged to blend with existing environments, particularly in scenic areas.
The dialogue between the handset and the cell site is a stream of digital data that includes digitised audio (except for the first generation analog networks). The technology that achieves this depends on the system which the mobile phone operator has adopted. The technologies are grouped by generation. The first-generation systems started in 1979 with Japan, are all analog and include AMPS and NMT. Second-generation systems, started in 1991 in Finland, are all digital and include GSM , CDMA and TDMA .
The nature of cellular technology renders many phones vulnerable to 'cloning': anytime a cell phone moves out of coverage (for example, in a road tunnel), when the signal is re-established, the phone sends out a 're-connect' signal to the nearest cell-tower, identifying itself and signalling that it is again ready to transmit. With the proper equipment, it's possible to intercept the re-connect signal and encode the data it contains into a 'blank' phone—in all respects, the 'blank' is then an exact duplicate of the real phone and any calls made on the 'clone' will be charged to the original account. This problem was widespread with the first generation analogue technology, however the modern digital standards such as GSM greatly improve security and make cloning hard to achieve.
In an effort to limit the potential harm from having a transmitter close to the user's body, the first fixed/mobile cellular phones that had a separate transmitter, vehicle-mounted antenna, and handset (known as car phones and bag phones ) were limited to a maximum 3 watts Effective Radiated Power . Modern handheld cellphones which must have the transmission antenna held inches from the user's skull are limited to a maximum transmission power of 0.6 watts ERP. Regardless of the potential biological effects, the reduced transmission range of modern handheld phones limits their usefulness in rural locations as compared to car/bag phones, and handhelds require that cell towers are spaced much closer together to compensate for their lack of transmission power.

Usage

By civilians
An increasing number of countries, particularly in Europe, now have more mobile phones than people. According to the figures from Eurostat, the European Union's in-house statistical office, Luxembourg had the highest mobile phone penetration rate at 158 mobile subscriptions per 100 people, closely followed by Lithuania and Italy. [15] In Hong Kong the penetration rate reached 139.8% of the population in July 2007. [16] Over 50 countries have mobile phone subscription penetration rates higher than that of the population and the Western European average penetration rate was 110% in 2007 (source Informa 2007). Canada currently has the lowest rates of mobile phone penetrations in the industrialised world at 58%.
There are over five hundred million active mobile phone accounts in China, as of 2007, but the total penetration rate there still stands below 50%. [17] The total number of mobile phone subscribers in the world was estimated at 2.14 billion in 2005. [18] The subscriber count reached 2.7 billion by end of 2006 according to Informa [ citation needed ] , and 3.3 billion by November, 2007, [14] thus reaching an equivalent of over half the planet's population. Around 80% of the world's population has access to mobile phone coverage, as of 2006. This figure is expected to increase to 90% by the year 2010. [19]
In some developing countries with little "landline" telephone infrastructure , mobile phone use has quadrupled in the last decade. [20] The rise of mobile phone technology in developing countries is often cited as an example of the leapfrog effect . Many remote regions in the third world went from having no telecommunications infrastructure to having satellite based communications systems. At present, Africa has the largest growth rate of cellular subscribers in the world, [21] its markets expanding nearly twice as fast as Asian markets. [22] The availability of prepaid or 'pay-as-you-go' services, where the subscriber is not committed to a long term contract, has helped fuel this growth in Africa as well as in other continents.
On a numerical basis, India is the largest growth market, adding about 6 million mobile phones every month. [23] It currently has a mobile subscriber base of 937.06 million mobile phones. [24]

Traffic
Since the world is operating quickly to 3G and 4G networks, mobile traffic through video is heading high. It is expected that by end of 2018, the global traffic will reach an annual rate of 190 exabytes/year. This is the result of people shifting to smart phones now-a-days. It is predicted by 2018, mobile traffic will reach by 10 billion connections with 94% traffic comes from Smartphones, laptops and tablets. Also 69% of mobile traffic from Videos since we have high definition screens available in smart phones and 176.9 wearable devices to be at use. Apparently, 4G will be dominating the traffic by 51% of total mobile data by 2018. [25]

By government agencies

Law enforcement
Law enforcement have used mobile phone evidence in a number of different ways. Evidence about the physical location of an individual at a given time can be obtained by triangulating the individual's cellphone between several cellphone towers. This triangulation technique can be used to show that an individual's cellphone was at a certain location at a certain time. The concerns over terrorism and terrorist use of technology prompted an inquiry by the British House of Commons Home Affairs Select Committee into the use of evidence from mobile phone devices, prompting leading mobile telephone forensic specialists to identify forensic techniques available in this area. [26] NIST have published guidelines and procedures for the preservation, acquisition, examination, analysis, and reporting of digital information present on mobile phones can be found under the NIST Publication SP800-101. [27]
In the UK in 2000 it was claimed that recordings of mobile phone conversations made on the day of the Omagh bombing were crucial to the police investigation. In particular, calls made on two mobile phones which were tracked from south of the Irish border to Omagh and back on the day of the bombing, were considered of vital importance. [28]
Further example of criminal investigations using mobile phones is the initial location and ultimate identification of the terrorists of the 2004 Madrid train bombings . In the attacks, mobile phones had been used to detonate the bombs. However, one of the bombs failed to detonate, and the SIM card in the corresponding mobile phone gave the first serious lead about the terrorists to investigators. By tracking the whereabouts of the SIM card and correlating other mobile phones that had been registered in those areas, police were able to locate the terrorists. [29]

Disaster response
The Finnish government decided in 2005 that the fastest way to warn citizens of disasters was the mobile phone network. In Japan, mobile phone companies provide immediate notification of earthquakes and other natural disasters to their customers free of charge. [30] In the event of an emergency, disaster response crews can locate trapped or injured people using the signals from their mobile phones. An interactive menu accessible through the phone's Internet browser notifies the company if the user is safe or in distress. [ citation needed ] In Finland rescue services suggest hikers carry mobile phones in case of emergency even when deep in the forests beyond cellular coverage , as the radio signal of a cellphone attempting to connect to a base station can be detected by overflying rescue aircraft with special detection gear. Also, users in the United States can sign up through their provider for free text messages when an AMBER Alert goes out for a missing person in their area.
However, most mobile phone networks operate close to capacity during normal times, and spikes in call volumes caused by widespread emergencies often overload the system just when it is needed the most. Examples reported in the media where this has occurred include the September 11, 2001 attacks , the 2003 Northeast blackouts , the 2005 London Tube bombings , Hurricane Katrina , the 2006 Hawaii earthquake , and the 2007 Minnesota bridge collapse .
Under FCC regulations, all mobile telephones must be capable of dialing emergency telephone numbers , regardless of the presence of a SIM card or the payment status of the account.

Impact on Society

Human health
Since the introduction of mobile phones, concerns (both scientific and public) have been raised about the potential health impacts from regular use. [31] But by 2008, American mobile phones transmitted and received more text messages than phone calls. [32] Numerous studies have reported no significant relationship between mobile phone use and health, but the effect of mobile phone usage on health continues to be an area of public concern. [ citation needed ]
For example, at the request of some of their customers, Verizon created usage controls that meter service and can switch phones off, so that children could get some sleep. [32] There have also been attempts to limit use by persons operating moving trains or automobiles, coaches when writing to potential players on their teams, and movie theater audiences. [32] By one measure, nearly 40% of automobile drivers aged 16 to 30 years old text while driving, and by another, 40% of teenagers said they could text blindfolded. [32]
18 studies have been conducted on the link between cell phones and brain cancer; A review of these studies found that cell phone use of 10 years or more "give a consistent pattern of an increased risk for acoustic neuroma and glioma". [33] The tumors are found mostly on the side of the head that the mobile phone is in contact with. In July 2008, Dr. Ronald Herberman , director of the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute , warned about the radiation from mobile phones. He stated that there was no definitive proof of the link between mobile phones and brain tumors but there was enough studies that mobile phone usage should be reduced as a precaution. [34] To reduce the amount of radiation being absorbed hands free devices can be used or texting could supplement calls. Calls could also be shortened or limit mobile phone usage in rural areas. Radiation is found to be higher in areas that are located away from mobile phone towers. [35]
According to Reuters , The British Association of Dermatologists is warning of a rash occurring on people’s ears or cheeks caused by an allergic reaction from the nickel surface commonly found on mobile devices’ exteriors. There is also a theory it could even occur on the fingers if someone spends a lot of time text messaging on metal menu buttons. In 2008, Lionel Bercovitch of Brown University in Providence , Rhode Island, and his colleagues tested 22 popular handsets from eight different manufacturers and found nickel on 10 of the devices. [36]

Human behaviour

Culture and customs
Between the 1980s and the 2000s, the mobile phone has gone from being an expensive item used by the business elite to a pervasive, personal communications tool for the general population. In most countries, mobile phones outnumber land-line phones, with fixed landlines numbering 1.3 billion but mobile subscriptions 3.3 billion at the end of 2007.
In many markets from Japan and South Korea, to Europe, to Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong, most children age 8-9 have mobile phones and the new accounts are now opened for customers aged 6 and 7. Where mostly parents tend to give hand-me-down used phones to their youngest children, in Japan already new cameraphones are on the market whose target age group is under 10 years of age, introduced by KDDI in February 2007. The USA also lags on this measure, as in the US so far, about half of all children have mobile phones. [37] In many young adults ' households it has supplanted the land-line phone. Mobile phone usage is banned in some countries, such as North Korea and restricted in some other countries such as Burma. [38]
Given the high levels of societal mobile phone service penetration, it is a key means for people to communicate with each other. The SMS feature spawned the " texting " sub-culture amongst younger users. In December 1993, the first person-to-person SMS text message was transmitted in Finland. Currently, texting is the most widely used data service; 1.8 billion users generated $80 billion of revenue in 2006 (source ITU). Many phones offer Instant Messenger services for simple, easy texting. Mobile phones have Internet service (e.g. NTT DoCoMo 's i-mode ), offering text messaging via e-mail in Japan, South Korea, China, and India. Most mobile internet access is much different from computer access, featuring alerts, weather data, e-mail, search engines, instant messages, and game and music downloading; most mobile internet access is hurried and short.
Because mobile phones are often used publicly, social norms have been shown to play a major role in the usage of mobile phones. [39] Furthermore, the mobile phone can be a fashion totem custom-decorated to reflect the owner's personality [40] and may be a part of their self-identity. [39] This aspect of the mobile telephony business is, in itself, an industry, e.g. ringtone sales amounted to $3.5 billion in 2005. [41] Mobile phone use on aircraft is starting to be allowed with several airlines already offering the ability to use phones during flights. Mobile phone use during flights used to be prohibited and many airlines still claim in their in-plane announcements that this prohibition is due to possible interference with aircraft radio communications. Shut-off mobile phones do not interfere with aircraft avionics. The recommendation why phones should not be used during take-off and landing, even on planes that allow calls or messaging, is so that passengers pay attention to the crew for any possible accident situations, as most aircraft accidents happen on take-off and landing.

Etiquette
Mobile phone use can be an important matter of social discourtesy: phones ringing during funerals or weddings; in toilets, cinemas and theatres. Some book shops , libraries, bathrooms, cinemas, doctors' offices and places of worship prohibit their use, so that other patrons will not be disturbed by conversations. Some facilities install signal-jamming equipment to prevent their use, although in many countries, including the US, such equipment is illegal.
Many US cities with subway transit systems underground are studying or have implemented mobile phone reception in their underground tunnels for their riders, and trains, particularly those involving long-distance services, often offer a "quiet carriage" where phone use is prohibited, much like the designated non-smoking carriage of the past. Most schools in the United States and Europe and Canada have prohibited mobile phones in the classroom, or in school in an effort to limit class disruptions.
A working group made up of Finnish telephone companies, public transport operators and communications authorities has launched a campaign to remind mobile phone users of courtesy, especially when using mass transit—what to talk about on the phone, and how to. In particular, the campaign wants to impact loud mobile phone usage as well as calls regarding sensitive matters. [42]

Use by drivers
The use of mobile phones by people who are driving has become increasingly common, for example as part of their job, as in the case of delivery drivers who are calling a client, or socially as for commuters who are chatting with a friend. While many drivers have embraced the convenience of using their cellphone while driving, some jurisdictions have made the practice against the law, such as Australia, the Canadian provinces of British Columbia , Quebec , Ontario, Nova Scotia , and Newfoundland and Labrador as well as the United Kingdom, consisting of a zero-tolerance system operated in Scotland and a warning system operated in England, Wales , and Northern Ireland . Officials from these jurisdictions argue that using a mobile phone while driving is an impediment to vehicle operation that can increase the risk of road traffic accidents.
Studies have found vastly different relative risks (RR). Two separate studies using case-crossover analysis each calculated RR at 4, [43] [44] while an epidemiological cohort study found RR, when adjusted for crash-risk exposure, of 1.11 for men and 1.21 for women. [45]
A simulation study from the University of Utah Professor David Strayer compared drivers with a blood alcohol content of 0.08% to those conversing on a cell phone, and after controlling for driving difficulty and time on task, the study concluded that cell phone drivers exhibited greater impairment than intoxicated drivers. [46] Meta-analysis by The Canadian Automobile Association [47] and The University of Illinois [48] found that response time while using both hands-free and hand-held phones was approximately 0.5 standard deviations higher than normal driving (i.e., an average driver, while talking on a cell phone, has response times of a driver in roughly the 40th percentile).
Driving while using a hands-free device is not safer than driving while using a hand-held phone, as concluded by case-crossover studies. [44] [43] epidemiological studies, [45] simulation studies, [46] and meta-analysis. [47] [48] Even with this information, California initiated new Wireless Communications Device Law (effective January 1, 2009) makes it an infraction to write, send, or read text-based communication on an electronic wireless communications device, such as a cell phone, while driving a motor vehicle. Two additional laws dealing with the use of wireless telephones while driving went into effect July 1, 2008. The first law prohibits all drivers from using a handheld wireless telephone while operating a motor vehicle. The law allows a driver to use a wireless telephone to make emergency calls to a law enforcement agency, a medical provider, the fire department, or other emergency services agency. The base fine for the FIRST offense is $20 and $50 for subsequent convictions. With penalty assessments, the fine can be more than triple the base fine amount. [49] videos about California cellular phone laws; with captions (California Vehicle Code [VC] §23123). Motorists 18 and over may use a “hands-free device. The second law effective July 1, 2008, prohibits drivers under the age of 18 from using a wireless telephone or hands-free device while operating a motor vehicle (VC §23124)The consistency of increased crash risk between hands-free and hand-held phone use is at odds with legislation in over 30 countries that prohibit hand-held phone use but allow hands-free. Scientific literature is mixed on the dangers of talking on a phone versus those of talking with a passenger, with the Accident Research Unit at the University of Nottingham finding that the number of utterances was usually higher for mobile calls when compared to blindfolded and non-blindfolded passengers, [50] but the University of Illinois meta-analysis concluding that passenger conversations were just as costly to driving performance as cell phone ones. [48]

Use on aircraft
As of 2007, several airlines are experimenting with base station and antenna systems installed on the airplane, allowing low power, short-range connection of any phones aboard to remain connected to the aircraft's base station. [51] Thus, they would not attempt connection to the ground base stations as during take off and landing. [ citation needed ] Simultaneously, airlines may offer phone services to their travelling passengers either as full voice and data services, or initially only as SMS text messaging and similar services. The Australian airline Qantas is the first airline to run a test aeroplane in this configuration in the autumn of 2007. [ citation needed ] Emirates has announced plans to allow limited mobile phone usage on some flights. [ citation needed ] However, in the past, commercial airlines have prevented the use of cell phones and laptops, due to the assertion that the frequencies emitted from these devices may disturb the radio waves contact of the airplane.
On March 20, 2008, an Emirates flight was the first time voice calls have been allowed in-flight on commercial airline flights. The breakthrough came after the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and the United Arab Emirates-based General Civil Aviation Authority (GCAA) granted full approval for the AeroMobile system to be used on Emirates. Passengers were able to make and receive voice calls as well as use text messaging. The system automatically came into operation as the Airbus A340-300 reached cruise altitude. Passengers wanting to use the service received a text message welcoming them to the AeroMobile system when they first switched their phones on. The approval by EASA has established that GSM phones are safe to use on airplanes, as the AeroMobile system does not require the modification of aircraft components deemed "sensitive," nor does it require the use of modified phones.
In any case, there are inconsistencies between practices allowed by different airlines and even on the same airline in different countries. For example, Delta Air Lines may allow the use of mobile phones immediately after landing on a domestic flight within the US, whereas they may state "not until the doors are open" on an international flight arriving in the Netherlands. In April 2007 the US Federal Communications Commission officially prohibited passengers' use of cell phones during a flight. [52]
In a similar vein, signs are put up in many countries, such as Canada, the UK and the U.S., at petrol stations prohibiting the use of mobile phones, due to possible safety issues. [ citation needed ] However, it is unlikely that mobile phone use can cause any problems, [53] and in fact "petrol station employees have themselves spread the rumour about alleged incidents."

Environmental impacts
Like all high structures, cellular antenna masts pose a hazard to low flying aircraft. Towers over a certain height or towers that are close to airports or heliports are normally required to have warning lights . There have been reports that warning lights on cellular masts, TV-towers and other high structures can attract and confuse birds. US authorities estimate that millions of birds are killed near communication towers in the country each year. [54]
Some cellular antenna towers have been camouflaged to make them less obvious on the horizon, and make them look more like a tree.
An example of the way mobile phones and mobile networks have sometimes been perceived as a threat is the widely reported and later discredited claim that mobile phone masts are associated with the Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) which has reduced bee hive numbers by up to 75% in many areas, especially near cities in the US. The Independent newspaper cited a scientific study claiming it provided evidence for the theory that mobile phone masts are a major cause in the collapse of bee populations, with controlled experiments demonstrating a rapid and catastrophic effect on individual hives near masts. [55] Mobile phones were in fact not covered in the study, and the original researchers have since emphatically disavowed any connection between their research, mobile phones, and CCD, specifically indicating that the Independent article had misinterpreted their results and created "a horror story". [56] [57] While the initial claim of damage to bees was widely reported, the corrections to the story were almost non-existent in the media.
There are more than 500 million used mobile phones in the US sitting on shelves or in landfills, [58] and it is estimated that over 125 million will be discarded this year alone. [ citation needed ] The problem is growing at a rate of more than two million phones per week, putting tons of toxic waste into landfills daily. Several companies offer to buy back and recycle mobile phones from users. In the United States many unwanted but working mobile phones are donated to women's shelters to allow emergency communication.

Tariff models

Payment methods
There are two principal ways to pay for mobile telephony: the 'pay-as-you-go' model where conversation time is purchased and added to a phone unit via an Internet account or in shops or ATMs, or the contract model where bills are paid by regular intervals after the service has been consumed. It is increasingly common for a consumer to purchase a basic package and then bolt-on services and functionality to create a subscription customised to the users needs.
Pay as you go (also known as "pre-pay" or "prepaid") accounts were invented simultaneously in Portugal and Italy and today form more than half of all mobile phone subscriptions. [ citation needed ] USA, Canada, Costa Rica, Japan, Israel and Finland are among the rare countries left where most phones are still contract-based. [ citation needed ]

Incoming call charges
In the early days of mobile telephony , the operators (carriers) charged for all air time consumed by the mobile phone user, which included both outbound and inbound telephone calls . As mobile phone adoption rates increased, competition between operators meant that some decided not to charge for incoming calls in some markets (also called "calling party pays").
The European market adopted a calling party pays model throughout the GSM environment and soon various other GSM markets also started to emulate this model.
In Hong Kong, Singapore, Canada, and the United States, it is common for the party receiving the call to be charged per minute, although a few carriers are beginning to offer unlimited received phone calls. This is called the "Receiving Party Pays" model. In China, it was reported that both of its two operators will adopt the caller-pays approach as early as January 2007. [59]
One disadvantage of the receiving party pays systems is that phone owners keep their phones turned off to avoid receiving unwanted calls, which results in the total voice usage rates (and profits) in Calling Party Pays countries outperform those in Receiving Party Pays countries. [60] To avoid the problem of users keeping their phone turned off, most Receiving Party Pays countries have either switched to Calling Party Pays, or their carriers offer additional incentives such as a large number of monthly minutes at a sufficiently discounted rate to compensate for the inconvenience.
Note that when a user roaming in another country, international roaming tariffs apply to all calls received, regardless of the model adopted in the home country. [61]

PLOS
PLOS (for Public Library of Science ) is a nonprofit open access science, technology and medicine publisher, innovator and advocacy organization with a library of open access journals and other scientific literature under an open content license. It launched its first journal, PLOS Biology , in October 2003 and publishes seven journals, as of October 2015 [update] . [1] [2] The organization is based in San Francisco , California , and has a European editorial office in Cambridge , England . The publications are primarily funded by payments from the authors.

History
The Public Library of Science began in 2000 with an online petition initiative by Nobel Prize winner Harold Varmus , formerly director of the National Institutes of Health and at that time director of Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center ; Patrick O. Brown , a biochemist at Stanford University ; and Michael Eisen , a computational biologist at the University of California, Berkeley , and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory . [4] [5] The petition called for all scientists to pledge that from September 2001 they would discontinue submission of papers to journals that did not make the full text of their papers available to all, free and unfettered, either immediately or after a delay of no more than 6 months. Although tens of thousands signed the petition, most did not act upon its terms; and in August 2001, Brown and Eisen announced they would start their own non-profit publishing operation. [6] In December 2002, the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation awarded PLOS a $9 million grant, which it followed in May 2006 with a $1 million grant to help PLOS achieve financial sustainability and launch new free-access biomedical journals. [7]
The PLOS organizers turned their attention to starting their own journal, along the lines of the UK -based BioMed Central, which has been publishing open access scientific papers in the biological sciences in journals such as Genome Biology and the Journal of Biology since late 1999.
As a publishing company, the Public Library of Science officially launched its operation on 13 October 2003, with the publication of a print and online scientific journal entitled PLOS Biology , and has since launched seven more journals. One, PLOS Clinical Trials , has since been merged into PLOS ONE . Following the merger, the company started the PLOS Hub for Clinical Trials to collect journal articles published in any PLOS journal and relating to clinical trials.
The PLOS journals are what it describes as "open access content"; all content is published under the Creative Commons "attribution" license . The project states (quoting the Budapest Open Access Initiative ) that: "The only constraint on reproduction and distribution, and the only role for copyright in this domain, should be to give authors control over the integrity of their work and the right to be properly acknowledged and cited."
In 2011, the Public Library of Science became an official financial supporting organization of Healthcare Information For All by 2015 , [8] a global initiative that advocates unrestricted access to medical knowledge, sponsoring the first HIFA2015 Webinar in 2012. [9]
In 2012 the organization quit using the stylization "PLoS" to identify itself and began using only "PLOS". [10]
In 2016, PLOS confirmed that their Chief Executive Officer, Elizabeth Marincola would be leaving for personal and professional reasons at the end of that year. [11] In May 2017, PLOS announced that their new CEO will be Alison Mudditt with effect from June. [12]

Financial model
To fund the journals, PLOS charges a publication fee to be paid by the author or the author's employer or funder. In the United States, institutions such as the National Institutes of Health and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute have pledged that recipients of their grants will be allocated funds to cover such author charges. The Global Participation Initiative (GPI) was instituted in 2012, by which authors in "group one countries" are not charged a fee, and those in group two countries are given a fee reduction. (In all cases, decisions to publish are based solely on editorial criteria.) PLOS was launched with grants totaling US$13 million from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation and the Sandler Family Supporting Foundation . [13] PLOS confirmed in July 2011 that it no longer relies on subsidies from foundations and is covering its operational costs itself. [14] [15] Since then PLOS' balance sheet has improved from $20,511,000 net assets in 2012-2013 to $36,591,000 in 2014-2015. [16] [17]

Publications

Other partners
In April 2017, PLOS was one of the founding partners in the Initiative for Open Citations . [18]

Headquarters
PLOS has its main headquarters in Suite 225 in the Koshland East Building in Levi's Plaza in San Francisco . [19] The company was previously located at 185 Berry Street. [20] [21] In June 2010, PLOS announced that it was moving to a new location in order to accommodate its rapid growth. The move to the Koshland East Building went into effect on 21 June 2010. [22]

Massachusetts Institute of Technology
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) is a private research university in Cambridge, Massachusetts , often cited as one of the world's most prestigious universities. [10] [11] [12] [13]
Founded in 1861 in response to the increasing industrialization of the United States , MIT adopted a European polytechnic university model and stressed laboratory instruction in applied science and engineering. Researchers worked on computers , radar , and inertial guidance during World War II and the Cold War . Post-war defense research contributed to the rapid expansion of the faculty and campus under James Killian . The current 168-acre (68.0 ha) campus opened in 1916 and extends over 1 mile (1.6 km) along the northern bank of the Charles River basin .
The Institute is traditionally known for its research and education in the physical sciences and engineering , and more recently in biology , economics , linguistics , and management as well. MIT is a member of the prestigious Association of American Universities (AAU) and founder of the Amsterdam Institute for Advanced Metropolitan Solutions (AMS Institute) . For several years, MIT's School of Engineering has been ranked first in various international and national university rankings, and the Institute is also often ranked among the world's top universities overall. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] The "Engineers" compete in 31 sports, most teams of which compete in the NCAA Division III 's New England Women's and Men's Athletic Conference ; the Division I rowing programs compete as part of the EARC and EAWRC .
As of 2015 [update] , 85 Nobel laureates , 52 National Medal of Science recipients, 65 Marshall Scholars , 45 Rhodes Scholars , 38 MacArthur Fellows , 34 astronauts , 19 Turing award winners , 16 Chief Scientists of the U.S. Air Force , and 6 Fields Medalists have been affiliated with MIT. The school has a strong entrepreneurial culture , and the aggregated revenues of companies founded by MIT alumni would rank as the eleventh-largest economy in the world. [15] [16]

History

Foundation and vision
In 1859, a proposal was submitted to the Massachusetts General Court to use newly filled lands in Back Bay , Boston for a " Conservatory of Art and Science ", but the proposal failed. [18] [19] A charter for the incorporation of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, proposed by William Barton Rogers , was signed by the governor of Massachusetts on April 10, 1861. [20]
Rogers, a professor from the University of Virginia , wanted to establish an institution to address rapid scientific and technological advances. [21] [22] He did not wish to found a professional school , but a combination with elements of both professional and liberal education , [23] proposing that:
The Rogers Plan reflected the German research university model , emphasizing an independent faculty engaged in research, as well as instruction oriented around seminars and laboratories. [25] [26]

Early developments
Two days after the charter was issued, the first battle of the Civil War broke out. After a long delay through the war years, MIT's first classes were held in the Mercantile Building in Boston in 1865. [27] The new institute was founded as part of the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act to fund institutions "to promote the liberal and practical education of the industrial classes", and was a land-grant school. [28] [29] In 1863 under the same act, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts founded the Massachusetts Agricultural College , which developed as the University of Massachusetts Amherst . In 1866, the proceeds from land sales went toward new buildings in the Back Bay. [30]
MIT was informally called "Boston Tech". [30] The institute adopted the European polytechnic university model and emphasized laboratory instruction from an early date. [31] Despite chronic financial problems, the institute saw growth in the last two decades of the 19th century under President Francis Amasa Walker . [32] Programs in electrical, chemical, marine, and sanitary engineering were introduced, [33] [34] new buildings were built, and the size of the student body increased to more than one thousand. [32]
The curriculum drifted to a vocational emphasis, with less focus on theoretical science. [35] The fledgling school still suffered from chronic financial shortages which diverted the attention of the MIT leadership. During these "Boston Tech" years, MIT faculty and alumni rebuffed Harvard University president (and former MIT faculty) Charles W. Eliot 's repeated attempts to merge MIT with Harvard College's Lawrence Scientific School . [36] There would be at least six attempts to absorb MIT into Harvard. [37] In its cramped Back Bay location, MIT could not afford to expand its overcrowded facilities, driving a desperate search for a new campus and funding. Eventually the MIT Corporation approved a formal agreement to merge with Harvard, over the vehement objections of MIT faculty, students, and alumni. [37] However, a 1917 decision by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court effectively put an end to the merger scheme. [37]
In 1916, the MIT administration and the MIT charter crossed the Charles River on the ceremonial barge Bucentaur built for the occasion, [38] [39] to signify MIT's move to a spacious new campus largely consisting of filled land on a mile-long tract along the Cambridge side of the Charles River. [40] [41] The neoclassical "New Technology" campus was designed by William W. Bosworth [42] and had been funded largely by anonymous donations from a mysterious "Mr. Smith", starting in 1912. In January 1920, the donor was revealed to be the industrialist George Eastman of Rochester, New York , who had invented methods of film production and processing, and founded Eastman Kodak . Between 1912 and 1920, Eastman donated $20 million ($236.6 million in 2015 dollars) in cash and Kodak stock to MIT. [43]

Curricular reforms
In the 1930s, President Karl Taylor Compton and Vice-President (effectively Provost ) Vannevar Bush emphasized the importance of pure sciences like physics and chemistry and reduced the vocational practice required in shops and drafting studios. [44] The Compton reforms "renewed confidence in the ability of the Institute to develop leadership in science as well as in engineering." [45] Unlike Ivy League schools, MIT catered more to middle-class families, and depended more on tuition than on endowments or grants for its funding. [46] The school was elected to the Association of American Universities in 1934. [47]
Still, as late as 1949, the Lewis Committee lamented in its report on the state of education at MIT that "the Institute is widely conceived as basically a vocational school", a "partly unjustified" perception the committee sought to change. The report comprehensively reviewed the undergraduate curriculum, recommended offering a broader education, and warned against letting engineering and government-sponsored research detract from the sciences and humanities. [48] [49] The School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences and the MIT Sloan School of Management were formed in 1950 to compete with the powerful Schools of Science and Engineering . Previously marginalized faculties in the areas of economics, management, political science, and linguistics emerged into cohesive and assertive departments by attracting respected professors and launching competitive graduate programs. [50] [51] The School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences continued to develop under the successive terms of the more humanistically oriented presidents Howard W. Johnson and Jerome Wiesner between 1966 and 1980. [52]

Defense research
MIT's involvement in military research surged during World War II . In 1941, Vannevar Bush was appointed head of the federal Office of Scientific Research and Development and directed funding to only a select group of universities, including MIT. [53] Engineers and scientists from across the country gathered at MIT's Radiation Laboratory , established in 1940 to assist the British military in developing microwave radar . The work done there significantly affected both the war and subsequent research in the area. [54] Other defense projects included gyroscope -based and other complex control systems for gunsight , bombsight , and inertial navigation under Charles Stark Draper 's Instrumentation Laboratory ; [55] [56] the development of a digital computer for flight simulations under Project Whirlwind ; [57] and high-speed and high-altitude photography under Harold Edgerton . [58] [59] By the end of the war, MIT became the nation's largest wartime R&D contractor (attracting some criticism of Bush), [53] employing nearly 4000 in the Radiation Laboratory alone [54] and receiving in excess of $100 million ($1.2 billion in 2015 dollars) before 1946. [45] Work on defense projects continued even after then. Post-war government-sponsored research at MIT included SAGE and guidance systems for ballistic missiles and Project Apollo . [60]
These activities affected MIT profoundly. A 1949 report noted the lack of "any great slackening in the pace of life at the Institute" to match the return to peacetime, remembering the "academic tranquility of the prewar years", though acknowledging the significant contributions of military research to the increased emphasis on graduate education and rapid growth of personnel and facilities. [62] The faculty doubled and the graduate student body quintupled during the terms of Karl Taylor Compton , president of MIT between 1930 and 1948; James Rhyne Killian , president from 1948 to 1957; and Julius Adams Stratton , chancellor from 1952 to 1957, whose institution-building strategies shaped the expanding university. By the 1950s, MIT no longer simply benefited the industries with which it had worked for three decades, and it had developed closer working relationships with new patrons, philanthropic foundations and the federal government. [63]
In late 1960s and early 1970s, student and faculty activists protested against the Vietnam War and MIT's defense research. [64] [65] In this period MIT's various departments were researching helicopters, smart bombs and counterinsurgency techniques for the war in Vietnam as well as guidance systems for nuclear missiles. [66] The Union of Concerned Scientists was founded on March 4, 1969 during a meeting of faculty members and students seeking to shift the emphasis on military research toward environmental and social problems. [67] MIT ultimately divested itself from the Instrumentation Laboratory and moved all classified research off-campus to the Lincoln Laboratory facility in 1973 in response to the protests. [68] [69] The student body, faculty, and administration remained comparatively unpolarized during what was a tumultuous time for many other universities. [64] Johnson was seen to be highly successful in leading his institution to "greater strength and unity" after these times of turmoil. [70] However six MIT students were sentenced to prison terms at this time and some former student leaders, such as Michael Albert and George Katsiaficas, are still indignant about MIT's role in military research and its suppression of these protests. [71] ( Richard Leacock 's film, November Actions , records some of these tumultuous events. [72] )
In the 1980s, there was more controversy at MIT over its involvement in SDI (space weaponry) and CBW (chemical and biological warfare) research. [73] More recently, MIT’s research for the military has included work on robots, drones and ‘battle suits’. [74]

Recent history
MIT has kept pace with and helped to advance the digital age. In addition to developing the predecessors to modern computing and networking technologies, [75] [76] students, staff, and faculty members at Project MAC , the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory , and the Tech Model Railroad Club wrote some of the earliest interactive computer video games like Spacewar! and created much of modern hacker slang and culture. [77] Several major computer-related organizations have originated at MIT since the 1980s: Richard Stallman 's GNU Project and the subsequent Free Software Foundation were founded in the mid-1980s at the AI Lab; the MIT Media Lab was founded in 1985 by Nicholas Negroponte and Jerome Wiesner to promote research into novel uses of computer technology; [78] the World Wide Web Consortium standards organization was founded at the Laboratory for Computer Science in 1994 by Tim Berners-Lee ; [79] the OpenCourseWare project has made course materials for over 2,000 MIT classes available online free of charge since 2002; [80] and the One Laptop per Child initiative to expand computer education and connectivity to children worldwide was launched in 2005. [81]
MIT was named a sea-grant college in 1976 to support its programs in oceanography and marine sciences and was named a space-grant college in 1989 to support its aeronautics and astronautics programs. [82] [83] Despite diminishing government financial support over the past quarter century, MIT launched several successful development campaigns to significantly expand the campus: new dormitories and athletics buildings on west campus; the Tang Center for Management Education ; several buildings in the northeast corner of campus supporting research into biology , brain and cognitive sciences , genomics , biotechnology , and cancer research ; and a number of new "backlot" buildings on Vassar Street including the Stata Center . [84] Construction on campus in the 2000s included expansions of the Media Lab, the Sloan School's eastern campus, and graduate residences in the northwest. [85] [86] In 2006, President Hockfield launched the MIT Energy Research Council to investigate the interdisciplinary challenges posed by increasing global energy consumption . [87]
In 2001, inspired by the open source and open access movements , [88] MIT launched OpenCourseWare to make the lecture notes, problem sets , syllabuses, exams, and lectures from the great majority of its courses available online for no charge, though without any formal accreditation for coursework completed. [89] While the cost of supporting and hosting the project is high, [90] OCW expanded in 2005 to include other universities as a part of the OpenCourseWare Consortium, which currently includes more than 250 academic institutions with content available in at least six languages. [91] In 2011, MIT announced it would offer formal certification (but not credits or degrees) to online participants completing coursework in its "MITx" program, for a modest fee. [92] The " edX " online platform supporting MITx was initially developed in partnership with Harvard and its analogous "Harvardx" initiative. The courseware platform is open source, and other universities have already joined and added their own course content. [93]
Three days after the Boston Marathon bombing of April 2013, MIT Police patrol officer Sean Collier was fatally shot by the suspects Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev , setting off a violent manhunt that shut down the campus and much of the Boston metropolitan area for a day. [94] One week later, Collier's memorial service was attended by more than 10,000 people, in a ceremony hosted by the MIT community with thousands of police officers from the New England region and Canada. [95] [96] [97] On November 25, 2013, MIT announced the creation of the Collier Medal, to be awarded annually to "an individual or group that embodies the character and qualities that Officer Collier exhibited as a member of the MIT community and in all aspects of his life". The announcement further stated that "Future recipients of the award will include those whose contributions exceed the boundaries of their profession, those who have contributed to building bridges across the community, and those who consistently and selflessly perform acts of kindness". [98] [99] [100]

Campus
MIT's 168-acre (68.0 ha) campus in the city of Cambridge spans approximately a mile along the north side of the Charles River basin. [6] The campus is divided roughly in half by Massachusetts Avenue , with most dormitories and student life facilities to the west and most academic buildings to the east. The bridge closest to MIT is the Harvard Bridge , which is known for being marked off in a non-standard unit of length – the smoot . [101] [102]
The Kendall MBTA Red Line station is located on the northeastern edge of the campus, in Kendall Square . The Cambridge neighborhoods surrounding MIT are a mixture of high tech companies occupying both modern office and rehabilitated industrial buildings, as well as socio-economically diverse residential neighborhoods. [103] [104] In early 2016, MIT presented its updated Kendall Square Initiative to the City of Cambridge, with plans for mixed-use educational, retail, residential, startup incubator, and office space in a dense high-rise transit-oriented development plan. [105] [106] The MIT Museum will eventually be moved immediately adjacent to a Kendall Square subway entrance, joining the List Visual Arts Center on the eastern end of the campus. [106] [107]
Each building at MIT has a number (possibly preceded by a W , N , E , or NW ) designation and most have a name as well. Typically, academic and office buildings are referred to primarily by number while residence halls are referred to by name. The organization of building numbers roughly corresponds to the order in which the buildings were built and their location relative (north, west, and east) to the original center cluster of Maclaurin buildings. [108] Many of the buildings are connected above ground as well as through an extensive network of underground tunnels, providing protection from the Cambridge weather as well as a venue for roof and tunnel hacking . [109] [110]
MIT's on-campus nuclear reactor [111] is one of the most powerful university-based nuclear reactors in the United States. The prominence of the reactor's containment building in a densely populated area has been controversial, [112] but MIT maintains that it is well-secured. [113] In 1999 Bill Gates donated US$20 million to MIT for the construction of a computer laboratory named the "William H. Gates Building", and designed by architect Frank O. Gehry . While Microsoft had previously given financial support to the institution, this was the first personal donation received from Gates. [114]
Other notable campus facilities include a pressurized wind tunnel and a towing tank for testing ship and ocean structure designs. [115] [116] MIT's campus-wide wireless network was completed in the fall of 2005 and consists of nearly 3,000 access points covering 9,400,000 square feet (870,000 m 2 ) of campus. [117]
In 2001, the Environmental Protection Agency sued MIT for violating the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act with regard to its hazardous waste storage and disposal procedures. [118] MIT settled the suit by paying a $155,000 fine and launching three environmental projects. [119] In connection with capital campaigns to expand the campus, the Institute has also extensively renovated existing buildings to improve their energy efficiency. MIT has also taken steps to reduce its environmental impact by running alternative fuel campus shuttles, subsidizing public transportation passes , and building a low-emission cogeneration plant that serves most of the campus electricity, heating, and cooling requirements. [120]
The MIT Police with state and local authorities, in the 2009-2011 period, have investigated reports of 12 forcible sex offenses, 6 robberies, 3 aggravated assaults, 164 burglaries, 1 case of arson, and 4 cases of motor vehicle theft on campus; affecting a community of around 22,000 students and employees. [121]
MIT has substantial commercial real estate holdings in Cambridge on which it pays property taxes , plus an additional voluntary payment in lieu of taxes (PILOT) on academic buildings which are legally tax-exempt. As of 2017 [update] , it is the largest taxpayer in the city, contributing approximately 14% of the city's annual revenues. [122] Holdings include Technology Square, parts of Kendall Square , and many properties in Cambridgeport and Area 4 neighboring the educational buildings. [123] The land is held for investment purposes and potential long-term expansion.

Architecture
MIT's School of Architecture , now the School of Architecture and Planning, was the first in the United States, [124] and it has a history of commissioning progressive buildings. [125] [126] The first buildings constructed on the Cambridge campus, completed in 1916, are sometimes called the "Maclaurin buildings" after Institute president Richard Maclaurin who oversaw their construction. Designed by William Welles Bosworth , these imposing buildings were built of reinforced concrete , a first for a non-industrial – much less university – building in the US. [127] Bosworth's design was influenced by the City Beautiful Movement of the early 1900s, [127] and features the Pantheon -esque Great Dome housing the Barker Engineering Library. The Great Dome overlooks Killian Court, where graduation ceremonies are held each year. The friezes of the limestone-clad buildings around Killian Court are engraved with the names of important scientists and philosophers. [a] The spacious Building 7 atrium at 77 Massachusetts Avenue is regarded as the entrance to the Infinite Corridor and the rest of the campus. [104]
Alvar Aalto 's Baker House (1947), Eero Saarinen 's MIT Chapel and Kresge Auditorium (1955), and I.M. Pei 's Green , Dreyfus, Landau, and Wiesner buildings represent high forms of post-war modernist architecture . [130] [131] [132] More recent buildings like Frank Gehry 's Stata Center (2004), Steven Holl 's Simmons Hall (2002), Charles Correa 's Building 46 (2005), and Fumihiko Maki 's Media Lab Extension (2009) stand out among the Boston area's classical architecture and serve as examples of contemporary campus "starchitecture". [125] [133] These buildings have not always been well received; [134] [135] in 2010, The Princeton Review included MIT in a list of twenty schools whose campuses are "tiny, unsightly, or both". [136]

Housing
Undergraduates are guaranteed four-year housing in one of MIT's 12 undergraduate dormitories . [137] Those living on campus can receive support and mentoring from live-in graduate student tutors, resident advisors, and faculty housemasters. [138] Because housing assignments are made based on the preferences of the students themselves, diverse social atmospheres can be sustained in different living groups; for example, according to the Yale Daily News staff's The Insider's Guide to the Colleges, 2010 , "The split between East Campus and West Campus is a significant characteristic of MIT. East Campus has gained a reputation as a thriving counterculture." [139] MIT also has 5 dormitories for single graduate students and 2 apartment buildings on campus for married student families. [140]
MIT has an active Greek and co-op housing system, including thirty-six fraternities , sororities , and independent living groups (FSILGs). [141] As of 2015 [update] , 98% of all undergraduates lived in MIT-affiliated housing; 54% of the men participated in fraternities and 20% of the women were involved in sororities. [142] Most FSILGs are located across the river in Back Bay near where MIT was founded, and there is also a cluster of fraternities on MIT's West Campus that face the Charles River Basin. [143] After the 1997 alcohol-related death of Scott Krueger, a new pledge at the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, MIT required all freshmen to live in the dormitory system starting in 2002. [144] Because FSILGs had previously housed as many as 300 freshmen off-campus, the new policy could not be implemented until Simmons Hall opened in that year. [145]

Organization and administration
MIT is chartered as a non-profit organization and is owned and governed by a privately appointed board of trustees known as the MIT Corporation. [146] The current board consists of 43 members elected to five-year terms, [147] 25 life members who vote until their 75th birthday, [148] 3 elected officers (President, Treasurer, and Secretary), [149] and 4 ex officio members (the president of the alumni association, the Governor of Massachusetts , the Massachusetts Secretary of Education, and the Chief Justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ). [150] [151] The board is chaired by Robert Millard , a co-founder of L-3 Communications Holdings . [152] [153] The Corporation approves the budget, new programs, degrees and faculty appointments, and elects the President to serve as the chief executive officer of the university and preside over the Institute's faculty. [104] [154] MIT's endowment and other financial assets are managed through a subsidiary called MIT Investment Management Company (MITIMCo). [155] Valued at $13.182 billion in 2016, MIT's endowment is the sixth-largest among American colleges and universities. [3]
MIT has five schools ( Science , Engineering , Architecture and Planning , Management , and Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences ) and one college ( Whitaker College of Health Sciences and Technology ), but no schools of law or medicine. [156] [b] While faculty committees assert substantial control over many areas of MIT's curriculum, research, student life, and administrative affairs, [158] the chair of each of MIT's 32 academic departments reports to the dean of that department's school, who in turn reports to the Provost under the President. [159] The current president is L. Rafael Reif , who formerly served as provost under President Susan Hockfield , the first woman to hold the post. [160] [161]

Academics
MIT is a large, highly residential, research university with a majority of enrollments in graduate and professional programs. [162] The university has been accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges since 1929. [163] [164] MIT operates on a 4–1–4 academic calendar with the fall semester beginning after Labor Day and ending in mid-December, a 4-week "Independent Activities Period" in the month of January, and the spring semester beginning in early February and ending in late May. [165]
MIT students refer to both their majors and classes using numbers or acronyms alone. [166] Departments and their corresponding majors are numbered in the approximate order of their foundation; for example, Civil and Environmental Engineering is Course 1 , while Linguistics and Philosophy is Course 24 . [167] Students majoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS), the most popular department, collectively identify themselves as "Course 6". MIT students use a combination of the department's course number and the number assigned to the class to identify their subjects; the introductory calculus-based classical mechanics course is simply "8.01" at MIT. [168] [c]

Undergraduate program
The four-year, full-time undergraduate program maintains a balance between professional majors and those in the arts and sciences, and has been dubbed "most selective" by U.S. News , [171] admitting few transfer students [162] and 8.0% of its applicants in the 2015 admissions cycle. [172] MIT offers 44 undergraduate degrees across its five schools. [173] In the 2010–2011 academic year, 1,161 bachelor of science degrees (abbreviated " SB ") were granted, the only type of undergraduate degree MIT now awards. [ needs update ] [174] [175] In the 2011 fall term, among students who had designated a major, the School of Engineering was the most popular division, enrolling 63% of students in its 19 degree programs, followed by the School of Science (29%), School of Humanities, Arts, & Social Sciences (3.7%), Sloan School of Management (3.3%), and School of Architecture and Planning (2%). [ needs update ] The largest undergraduate degree programs were in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science ( Course 6–2 ), Computer Science and Engineering ( Course 6–3 ), Mechanical Engineering ( Course 2 ), Physics ( Course 8 ), and Mathematics ( Course 18 ). [169]
All undergraduates are required to complete a core curriculum called the General Institute Requirements (GIRs). [176] The Science Requirement, generally completed during freshman year as prerequisites for classes in science and engineering majors, comprises two semesters of physics, two semesters of calculus, one semester of chemistry, and one semester of biology. There is a Laboratory Requirement, usually satisfied by an appropriate class in a course major. The Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences (HASS) Requirement consists of eight semesters of classes in the humanities, arts, and social sciences, including at least one semester from each division as well as the courses required for a designated concentration in a HASS division. Under the Communication Requirement, two of the HASS classes, plus two of the classes taken in the designated major must be "communication-intensive", [177] including "substantial instruction and practice in oral presentation". [178] Finally, all students are required to complete a swimming test; [179] non-varsity athletes must also take four quarters of physical education classes. [176]
Most classes rely on a combination of lectures, recitations led by associate professors or graduate students, weekly problem sets ("p-sets"), and periodic quizzes or tests. While the pace and difficulty of MIT coursework has been compared to "drinking from a fire hose", [180] [181] the freshmen retention rate at MIT is similar to other research universities. [171] The "pass/no-record" grading system relieves some pressure for first-year undergraduates. For each class taken in the fall term, freshmen transcripts will either report only that the class was passed, or otherwise not have any record of it. In the spring term, passing grades (A, B, C) appear on the transcript while non-passing grades are again not recorded. [182] (Grading had previously been "pass/no record" all freshman year, but was amended for the Class of 2006 to prevent students from gaming the system by completing required major classes in their freshman year. [183] ) Also, freshmen may choose to join alternative learning communities, such as Experimental Study Group , Concourse , or Terrascope. [182]
In 1969, Margaret MacVicar founded the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP) to enable undergraduates to collaborate directly with faculty members and researchers. Students join or initiate research projects ("UROPs") for academic credit, pay, or on a volunteer basis through postings on the UROP website or by contacting faculty members directly. [184] A substantial majority of undergraduates participate. [185] [186] Students often become published , file patent applications , and/or launch start-up companies based upon their experience in UROPs. [187] [188]
In 1970, the then-Dean of Institute Relations, Benson R. Snyder, published The Hidden Curriculum , arguing that education at MIT was often slighted in favor of following a set of unwritten expectations, and that graduating with good grades was more often the product of figuring out the system rather than a solid education. The successful student, according to Snyder, was the one who was able to discern which of the formal requirements were to be ignored in favor of which unstated norms. For example, organized student groups had compiled " course bibles "—collections of problem-set and examination questions and answers for later students to use as references. This sort of gamesmanship, Snyder argued, hindered development of a creative intellect and contributed to student discontent and unrest. [189] [190]

Graduate program
MIT's graduate program has high coexistence with the undergraduate program, and many courses are taken by qualified students at both levels. MIT offers a comprehensive doctoral program with degrees in the humanities, social sciences, and STEM fields as well as professional degrees. [162] The Institute offers graduate programs leading to academic degrees such as the Master of Science (MS), various Engineer's Degrees, Doctor of Philosophy (PhD), and Doctor of Science (ScD) and interdisciplinary graduate programs such as the MD-PhD (with Harvard Medical School ). [191] [192]
Admission to graduate programs is decentralized; applicants apply directly to the department or degree program. More than 90% of doctoral students are supported by fellowships, research assistantships (RAs), or teaching assistantships (TAs). [193]
MIT awarded 1,547 master's degrees and 609 doctoral degrees in the academic year 2010–11. [ needs update ] [174] In the 2011 fall term, the School of Engineering was the most popular academic division, enrolling 45.0% of graduate students, followed by the Sloan School of Management (19%), School of Science (16.9%), School of Architecture and Planning (9.2%), Whitaker College of Health Sciences (5.1%), [d] and School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences (4.7%). The largest graduate degree programs were the Sloan MBA , Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, and Mechanical Engineering. [169]

Rankings
MIT also places among the top ten in many overall rankings of universities (see right) and rankings based on students' revealed preferences . [202] [203] [204] For several years, U.S. News & World Report , the QS World University Rankings , and the Academic Ranking of World Universities have ranked MIT's School of Engineering first, as did the 1995 National Research Council report. [205] In the same lists, MIT's strongest showings apart from in engineering are in computer science, the natural sciences, business, architecture, economics, linguistics, mathematics, and, to a lesser extent, political science and philosophy. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14]
In 2014, Money magazine ranked MIT as third in the US "Best Colleges for Your Money", based on its assessment of "the most bang for your tuition buck", factoring in quality of education, affordability, and career outcomes. [206] As of 2014 [update] , Forbes magazine rated MIT as the second "Most Entrepreneurial University", based on the percentage of alumni and students self-identifying as founders or business owners on LinkedIn . [207] In 2015, Brookings Fellow Jonathan Rothwell issued a report "Beyond College Rankings", placing MIT as third in the US, with an estimated 45% value-added to mid-career salary. [208]

Collaborations
The university historically pioneered research and training collaborations between academia, industry and government. [209] [210] In 1946, President Compton, Harvard Business School professor Georges Doriot, and Massachusetts Investor Trust chairman Merrill Grisswold founded American Research and Development Corporation , the first American venture-capital firm. [211] [212] In 1948, Compton established the MIT Industrial Liaison Program. [213] Throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s, American politicians and business leaders accused MIT and other universities of contributing to a declining economy by transferring taxpayer-funded research and technology to international – especially Japanese – firms that were competing with struggling American businesses. [214] [215] On the other hand, MIT's extensive collaboration with the federal government on research projects has led to several MIT leaders serving as presidential scientific advisers since 1940. [e] MIT established a Washington Office in 1991 to continue effective lobbying for research funding and national science policy . [217] [218]
The U.S. Justice Department began an investigation in 1989, and in 1991 filed an antitrust suit against MIT, the eight Ivy League colleges, and eleven other institutions for allegedly engaging in price-fixing during their annual "Overlap Meetings", which were held to prevent bidding wars over promising prospective students from consuming funds for need-based scholarships. [219] [220] While the Ivy League institutions settled , [221] MIT contested the charges, arguing that the practice was not anti-competitive because it ensured the availability of aid for the greatest number of students. [222] [223] MIT ultimately prevailed when the Justice Department dropped the case in 1994. [224] [225]
MIT's proximity [f] to Harvard University ("the other school up the river ") has led to a substantial number of research collaborations such as the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology and the Broad Institute . [226] In addition, students at the two schools can cross-register for credits toward their own school's degrees without any additional fees. [226] A cross-registration program between MIT and Wellesley College has also existed since 1969, and in 2002 the Cambridge–MIT Institute launched an undergraduate exchange program between MIT and the University of Cambridge . [226] MIT has more modest cross-registration programs with Boston University , Brandeis University , Tufts University , Massachusetts College of Art , and the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston . [226]
MIT maintains substantial research and faculty ties with independent research organizations in the Boston area, such as the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory , the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research , and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution . Ongoing international research and educational collaborations include the Amsterdam Institute for Advanced Metropolitan Solutions (AMS Institute) , Singapore-MIT Alliance , MIT- Politecnico di Milano , [226] [227] MIT- Zaragoza International Logistics Program, and projects in other countries through the MIT International Science and Technology Initiatives (MISTI) program. [226] [228]
The mass-market magazine Technology Review is published by MIT through a subsidiary company, as is a special edition that also serves as an alumni magazine . [229] [230] The MIT Press is a major university press , publishing over 200 books and 30 journals annually, emphasizing science and technology as well as arts, architecture, new media, current events, and social issues. [231]

Libraries, collections and museums
The MIT library system consists of five subject libraries: Barker (Engineering), Dewey (Economics), Hayden (Humanities and Science), Lewis (Music), and Rotch (Arts and Architecture). There are also various specialized libraries and archives. The libraries contain more than 2.9 million printed volumes, 2.4 million microforms, 49,000 print or electronic journal subscriptions, and 670 reference databases. The past decade has seen a trend of increased focus on digital over print resources in the libraries. [232] Notable collections include the Lewis Music Library with an emphasis on 20th and 21st-century music and electronic music, [233] the List Visual Arts Center 's rotating exhibitions of contemporary art, [234] and the Compton Gallery's cross-disciplinary exhibitions. [235] MIT allocates a percentage of the budget for all new construction and renovation to commission and support its extensive public art and outdoor sculpture collection. [236] [237]
The MIT Museum was founded in 1971 and collects, preserves, and exhibits artifacts significant to the culture and history of MIT . The museum now engages in significant educational outreach programs for the general public, including the annual Cambridge Science Festival , the first celebration of this kind in the United States. Since 2005, its official mission has been, "to engage the wider community with MIT's science, technology and other areas of scholarship in ways that will best serve the nation and the world in the 21st century". [238]

Research
MIT was elected to the Association of American Universities in 1934 and remains a research university with a very high level of research activity; [47] [162] research expenditures totaled $718.2 million in 2009. [ needs update ] [239] The federal government was the largest source of sponsored research, with the Department of Health and Human Services granting $255.9 million, Department of Defense $97.5 million, Department of Energy $65.8 million, National Science Foundation $61.4 million, and NASA $27.4 million. [239] MIT employs approximately 1300 researchers in addition to faculty. [240] In 2011, MIT faculty and researchers disclosed 632 inventions, were issued 153 patents, earned $85.4 million in cash income, and received $69.6 million in royalties. [241] Through programs like the Deshpande Center, MIT faculty leverage their research and discoveries into multi-million-dollar commercial ventures. [242]
In electronics, magnetic core memory , radar , single electron transistors , and inertial guidance controls were invented or substantially developed by MIT researchers. [243] [244] Harold Eugene Edgerton was a pioneer in high speed photography and sonar . [245] [246] Claude E. Shannon developed much of modern information theory and discovered the application of Boolean logic to digital circuit design theory. [247] In the domain of computer science, MIT faculty and researchers made fundamental contributions to cybernetics , artificial intelligence , computer languages , machine learning , robotics , and cryptography . [244] [248] At least nine Turing Award laureates and seven recipients of the Draper Prize in engineering have been or are currently associated with MIT. [249] [250]
Current and previous physics faculty have won eight Nobel Prizes , [251] four Dirac Medals , [252] and three Wolf Prizes predominantly for their contributions to subatomic and quantum theory. [253] Members of the chemistry department have been awarded three Nobel Prizes and one Wolf Prize for the discovery of novel syntheses and methods. [251] MIT biologists have been awarded six Nobel Prizes for their contributions to genetics, immunology, oncology, and molecular biology. [251] Professor Eric Lander was one of the principal leaders of the Human Genome Project . [254] [255] Positronium atoms, [256] synthetic penicillin , [257] synthetic self-replicating molecules , [258] and the genetic bases for Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (also known as ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease) and Huntington's disease were first discovered at MIT. [259] Jerome Lettvin transformed the study of cognitive science with his paper "What the frog's eye tells the frog's brain". [260] Researchers developed a system to convert MRI scans into 3D printed physical models. [261]
In the domain of humanities, arts, and social sciences, MIT economists have been awarded five Nobel Prizes and nine John Bates Clark Medals . [251] [262] Linguists Noam Chomsky and Morris Halle authored seminal texts on generative grammar and phonology . [263] [264] The MIT Media Lab , founded in 1985 within the School of Architecture and Planning and known for its unconventional research, [265] [266] has been home to influential researchers such as constructivist educator and Logo creator Seymour Papert . [267]
Spanning many of the above fields, MacArthur Fellowships (the so-called "Genius Grants") have been awarded to 38 people associated with MIT. [268] Four Pulitzer Prize –winning writers currently work at or have retired from MIT. [269] Four current or former faculty are members of the American Academy of Arts and Letters . [270]
Allegations of research misconduct or improprieties have received substantial press coverage. Professor David Baltimore , a Nobel Laureate , became embroiled in a misconduct investigation starting in 1986 that led to Congressional hearings in 1991. [271] [272] Professor Ted Postol has accused the MIT administration since 2000 of attempting to whitewash potential research misconduct at the Lincoln Lab facility involving a ballistic missile defense test, though a final investigation into the matter has not been completed. [273] [274] Associate Professor Luk Van Parijs was dismissed in 2005 following allegations of scientific misconduct and found guilty of the same by the United States Office of Research Integrity in 2009. [275] [276]

Discoveries and innovation
[289] [290]

Traditions and student activities
The faculty and student body place a high value on meritocracy and on technical proficiency. [291] [292] MIT has never awarded an honorary degree , nor does it award athletic scholarships , ad eundem degrees , or Latin honors upon graduation. [293] However, MIT has twice awarded honorary professorships: to Winston Churchill in 1949 and Salman Rushdie in 1993. [294]
Many upperclass students and alumni wear a large, heavy, distinctive class ring known as the " Brass Rat ". [295] [296] Originally created in 1929, the ring's official name is the "Standard Technology Ring." [297] The undergraduate ring design (a separate graduate student version exists as well) varies slightly from year to year to reflect the unique character of the MIT experience for that class, but always features a three-piece design, with the MIT seal and the class year each appearing on a separate face, flanking a large rectangular bezel bearing an image of a beaver . [295] The initialism IHTFP , representing the informal school motto "I Hate This Fucking Place" and jocularly euphemized as "I Have Truly Found Paradise," "Institute Has The Finest Professors," "It's Hard to Fondle Penguins," and other variations, has occasionally been featured on the ring given its historical prominence in student culture. [298]

Activities
MIT has over 500 recognized student activity groups, [299] including a campus radio station , The Tech student newspaper, an annual entrepreneurship competition , and weekly screenings of popular films by the Lecture Series Committee . Less traditional activities include the "world's largest open-shelf collection of science fiction " in English, a model railroad club , and a vibrant folk dance scene. Students, faculty, and staff are involved in over 50 educational outreach and public service programs through the MIT Museum , Edgerton Center, and MIT Public Service Center. [300]
The Independent Activities Period is a four-week-long "term" offering hundreds of optional classes, lectures, demonstrations, and other activities throughout the month of January between the Fall and Spring semesters. Some of the most popular recurring IAP activities are the 6.270, 6.370, and MasLab competitions , [301] the annual "mystery hunt" , [302] and Charm School . [303] [304] More than 250 students pursue externships annually at companies in the US and abroad. [305] [306]
Many MIT students also engage in "hacking", which encompasses both the physical exploration of areas that are generally off-limits (such as rooftops and steam tunnels), as well as elaborate practical jokes . [307] [308] Recent high-profile hacks have included the abduction of Caltech's cannon , [309] reconstructing a Wright Flyer atop the Great Dome, [310] and adorning the John Harvard statue with the Master Chief's Mjölnir Helmet . [311]

Athletics
MIT sponsors 31 varsity sports and has one of the three broadest NCAA Division III athletic programs. [312] [313] MIT participates in the NCAA's Division III , the New England Women's and Men's Athletic Conference , the New England Football Conference , the Pilgrim League for men's lacrosse, NCAA's Division I Eastern Association of Women's Rowing Colleges (EAWRC) for women's crew, and the Collegiate Water Polo Association (CWPA) for Men's Water Polo. Men's crew competes outside the NCAA in the Eastern Association of Rowing Colleges (EARC) . In April 2009, budget cuts led to MIT eliminating eight of its 41 sports, including the mixed men's and women's teams in alpine skiing and pistol; separate teams for men and women in ice hockey and gymnastics; and men's programs in golf and wrestling. [314] [315]

People

Students
MIT enrolled 4,384 undergraduates and 6,510 graduate students in 2011–2012. [ needs update ] [169] Women constituted 45 percent of undergraduate students. [ needs update ] [169] [318] Undergraduate and graduate students were drawn from all 50 states as well as 115 foreign countries. [319]
MIT received 17,909 applications for admission to the undergraduate Class of 2015; 1,742 were admitted (9.7 percent) and 1128 enrolled (64.8 percent). [ needs update ] [142] 19,446 applications were received for graduate and advanced degree program across all departments; 2,991 were admitted (15.4 percent) and 1,880 enrolled (62.8 percent). [ needs update ] [320]
The interquartile range on the SAT was 2090–2340 and 97 percent of students ranked in the top tenth of their high school graduating class. [ needs update ] [142] 97 percent of the Class of 2012 returned as sophomores; 82 percent of the Class of 2007 graduated within 4 years, and 93 percent (91 percent of the men and 95 percent of the women) graduated within 6 years. [142] [321]
Undergraduate tuition and fees total $40,732 and annual expenses are estimated at $52,507 as of 2012. [ needs update ] 62 percent of students received need-based financial aid in the form of scholarships and grants from federal, state, institutional, and external sources averaging $38,964 per student. [ needs update ] [322] Students were awarded a total of $102 million in scholarships and grants, primarily from institutional support ($84 million). [142] The annual increase in expenses has led to a student tradition (dating back to the 1960s) of tongue-in-cheek "tuition riots". [323]
MIT has been nominally co-educational since admitting Ellen Swallow Richards in 1870. Richards also became the first female member of MIT's faculty, specializing in sanitary chemistry . [324] [325] Female students remained a minority prior to the completion of the first wing of a women's dormitory, McCormick Hall , in 1963. [326] [327] [328] Between 1993 and 2009, the proportion of women rose from 34 percent to 45 percent of undergraduates and from 20 percent to 31 percent of graduate students. [169] [329] Women currently outnumber men in Biology, Brain & Cognitive Sciences, Architecture, Urban Planning, and Biological Engineering. [169] [318]
A number of student deaths in the late 1990s and early 2000s resulted in considerable media attention to MIT's culture and student life. [330] [331] After the alcohol-related death of Scott Krueger in September 1997 as a new member at the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, [332] MIT began requiring all freshmen to live in the dormitory system. [332] [333] The 2000 suicide of MIT undergraduate Elizabeth Shin drew attention to suicides at MIT and created a controversy over whether MIT had an unusually high suicide rate. [334] [335] In late 2001 a task force's recommended improvements in student mental health services were implemented, [336] [337] including expanding staff and operating hours at the mental health center. [338] These and later cases were significant as well because they sought to prove the negligence and liability of university administrators in loco parentis . [334]

Faculty and staff
As of 2013 [update] , MIT had 1,030 faculty members, of whom 225 were women. [4] Faculty are responsible for lecturing classes, advising both graduate and undergraduate students, and sitting on academic committees, as well as conducting original research. Between 1964 and 2009, a total of seventeen faculty and staff members affiliated with MIT were awarded Nobel Prizes (thirteen in the last 25 years). [339] MIT faculty members past or present have won a total of twenty-seven Nobel Prizes, the majority in Economics or Physics. [340] As of October 2013 [update] , among current faculty and teaching staff there are 67 Guggenheim Fellows , 6 Fulbright Scholars , and 22 MacArthur Fellows . [4] Faculty members who have made extraordinary contributions to their research field as well as the MIT community are granted appointments as Institute Professors for the remainder of their tenures.
A 1998 MIT study concluded that a systemic bias against female faculty existed in its School of Science, [341] although the study's methods were controversial. [342] [343] Since the study, though, women have headed departments within the Schools of Science and of Engineering, and MIT has appointed several female vice presidents, although allegations of sexism continue to be made. [344] Susan Hockfield , a molecular neurobiologist , was MIT's president from 2004 to 2012 and was the first woman to hold the post. [161]
Tenure outcomes have vaulted MIT into the national spotlight on several occasions. The 1984 dismissal of David F. Noble , a historian of technology, became a cause célèbre about the extent to which academics are granted freedom of speech after he published several books and papers critical of MIT's and other research universities' reliance upon financial support from corporations and the military. [345] Former materials science professor Gretchen Kalonji sued MIT in 1994 alleging that she was denied tenure because of sexual discrimination. Several years later, the lawsuit was settled with undisclosed payments, and establishment of a project to encourage women and minorities to seek faculty positions. [344] [346] [347] In 1997, the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination issued a probable cause finding supporting UMass Boston Professor James Jennings' allegations of racial discrimination after a senior faculty search committee in the Department of Urban Studies and Planning did not offer him reciprocal tenure. [348]
In 2006–2007, MIT's denial of tenure to African-American stem cell scientist professor James Sherley reignited accusations of racism in the tenure process, eventually leading to a protracted public dispute with the administration, a brief hunger strike , and the resignation of Professor Frank L. Douglas in protest. [349] [350] The Boston Globe reported on February 6, 2007: "Less than half of MIT's junior faculty members are granted tenure. After Sherley was initially denied tenure, his case was examined three times before the university established that neither racial discrimination nor conflict of interest affected the decision. Twenty-one of Sherley's colleagues later issued a statement saying that the professor was treated fairly in tenure review." [351]
MIT faculty members have often been recruited to lead other colleges and universities. Founding faculty member Charles W. Eliot was recruited in 1869 to become president of Harvard University, a post he would hold for 40 years, during which he wielded considerable influence on both American higher education and secondary education. MIT alumnus and faculty member George Ellery Hale played a central role in the development of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), and other faculty members have been key founders of Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering in nearby Needham, Massachusetts .
As of 2014 [update] , former provost Robert A. Brown is president of Boston University ; former provost Mark Wrighton is chancellor of Washington University in St. Louis ; former associate provost Alice Gast is president of Lehigh University ; and former professor Suh Nam-pyo is president of KAIST . Former dean of the School of Science Robert J. Birgeneau was the chancellor of the University of California, Berkeley (2004–2013); former professor John Maeda was president of Rhode Island School of Design (RISD, 2008–2013); former professor David Baltimore was president of Caltech (1997–2006); and MIT alumnus and former assistant professor Hans Mark served as chancellor of the University of Texas system (1984–1992).
In addition, faculty members have been recruited to lead governmental agencies; for example, former professor Marcia McNutt is president of the National Academy of Sciences , [352] urban studies professor Xavier de Souza Briggs is currently the associate director of the White House Office of Management and Budget , [353] and biology professor Eric Lander is a co-chair of the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology . [354] In 2013, faculty member Ernest Moniz was nominated by President Obama and later confirmed as United States Secretary of Energy . [355] [356] Former professor Hans Mark served as Secretary of the Air Force from 1979 to 1981. Alumna and Institute Professor Sheila Widnall served as Secretary of the Air Force between 1993 and 1997, making her the first female Secretary of the Air Force and first woman to lead an entire branch of the US military in the Department of Defense.
As of 2017 [update] , MIT was the second-largest employer in the city of Cambridge. [122] Based on feedback from employees, MIT was ranked #7 as a place to work, among US colleges and universities as of 2013 [update] . [357] Surveys cited a "smart", "creative", "friendly" environment, noting that the work-life balance tilts towards a "strong work ethic" but complaining about "low pay" compared to an industry position. [358]

Notable alumni
Many of MIT's over 120,000 alumni have had considerable success in scientific research, public service, education, and business. As of 2014 [update] , 27 MIT alumni have won the Nobel Prize , 47 have been selected as Rhodes Scholars , and 61 have been selected as Marshall Scholars . [359]
Alumni in American politics and public service include former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Ben Bernanke , former MA-1 Representative John Olver , former CA-13 Representative Pete Stark , former National Economic Council chairman Lawrence H. Summers , and former Council of Economic Advisors chairwoman Christina Romer . MIT alumni in international politics include Foreign Affairs Minister of Iran Ali Akbar Salehi , Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , President of Colombia Virgilio Barco Vargas , President of the European Central Bank Mario Draghi , former Governor of the Reserve Bank of India Raghuram Rajan , former British Foreign Minister David Miliband , former Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos , former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan , and former Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Ahmed Chalabi .
MIT alumni founded or co-founded many notable companies, such as Intel , McDonnell Douglas , Texas Instruments , 3Com , Qualcomm , Bose , Raytheon , Koch Industries , Rockwell International , Genentech , Dropbox , and Campbell Soup . According to the British newspaper, The Guardian , "a survey of living MIT alumni found that they have formed 25,800 companies, employing more than three million people including about a quarter of the workforce of Silicon Valley. Those firms collectively generate global revenues of about $1.9 trillion (£1.2 trillion) a year. If MIT were a country, it would have the 11th highest GDP of any nation in the world." [360] [361] [362]
Prominent institutions of higher education have been led by MIT alumni, including the University of California system, Harvard University , New York Institute of Technology , Johns Hopkins University , Carnegie Mellon University , Tufts University , Rochester Institute of Technology , Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) , Northeastern University , Lahore University of Management Sciences , Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute , Tecnológico de Monterrey , Purdue University , Virginia Polytechnic Institute , KAIST , and Quaid-e-Azam University . Berklee College of Music , the largest independent college of contemporary music in the world, was founded and led by MIT alumnus Lawrence Berk for more than three decades.

Open Government Licence
The Open Government Licence is a copyright licence for Crown Copyright works published by the UK government . Other UK public sector bodies may apply it to their publications. It was developed and is maintained by The National Archives . It is compatible with the Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY) licence .

History
Since 2001 some works of the UK government had been made available under the Click-Use Licence . [1] This was replaced by the first version of the OGL [2] when it was released on 30 September 2010. The OGL was developed by The National Archives . [1]
The OGL was developed as part of the UK Government Licensing Framework , which also includes a non-commercial Government licence that restricts the commercial use of licensed content, as well as a charged licence for situations where charging for the re-use of content is deemed appropriate. [3]
The first version was designed to work in parallel with other licences such as those released by Creative Commons , [1] mirroring the Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY) licence and the Open Data Commons Attribution Licence . [4]
Version 2.0, released on 28 June 2013, is directly compatible with the Creative Commons Attribution License 4.0 and the Open Data Commons Attribution License. [5] The OGL symbol (shown above) was also released along with this version, with the aim of indicating "at a glance, shows that information can be used and re-used under open licensing". [6]
Version 3.0 was released on 31 October 2014. [7] It is interoperable with Creative Commons' Attribution 4.0 license, and an OGL-licensed work could be used in a CC licensed work, however it should be clear that the material used is being used under the OGL and it should still be linked to the OGL. [8]

Licence
The OGL permits anyone to copy, publish, distribute, transmit and adapt the licensed work, and to exploit it both commercially and non-commercially. In return, the re-user of the licensed work has to acknowledge the source of the work and (if possible) provide a link to the OGL. [9]
The license is also available in machine-readable format . [4]

Applicability
The OGL applies to many but not all Crown Copyright works. [9] The works must have been expressly released under the OGL terms by the relevant rights owner or authorised information provider. [10] The licence may also be used by other public sector bodies, such as local government , the National Health Service or the police. [4] It may be applied to texts, media, databases and source code. [4]
The OGL includes a list of types of information that it cannot cover. The licence states that it does not apply to: [9]
The Ministry of Defence interpret the "personal data" restriction to mean that photographs where "at least one individual is recognisable" cannot be OGL. [11]

Use
Use of the OGL is encouraged by the Re-use of Public Sector Information Regulations 2015 , regulation 12 of which requires licences to be as non-restrictive as possible. [12]
The OGL is used by organisations at various levels within the UK Government , including:

Government gazette
A government gazette ( official gazette , official journal , official newspaper or official diary ) is a periodical publication that records the business and proceedings of a government and has been authorised to publish public or legal notices. It is usually established by statute or official action and publication of notices within it, whether by the government or a private party, is usually considered sufficient to comply with legal requirements for public notice. [1]

Publication within privately owned periodicals
In some jurisdictions, privately owned newspapers may also register with the public authorities in order to publish public and legal notices. [2] [3] [4] Likewise, a private newspaper may be designated by the courts for publication of legal notices, such as notices of fictitious business names . These are referred to as "legally adjudicated newspapers". [5]

Journals of legislative bodies
Several jurisdictions also publish a separate periodical record of the proceedings of their legislature.

United Kingdom
The journals of the British Houses of Parliament , alongside the Hansard , contain an official record of the Houses of Parliament . The journals are a lengthened account written from the "Votes and Proceedings" (in the House of Lords called "Minutes of Proceedings"), made day by day by the Clerks at the Table, and printed on the responsibility of the Clerk of the House. In the Commons the Votes and Proceedings, but not the Journal, bear the Speaker's signature in fulfilment of a former order that he should "peruse" them before publication. The journals of the British House of Commons begin in the first year of the reign of Edward VI in 1547, and are complete, except for a short interval under Elizabeth I . Those of the House of Lords date from the first year of Henry VIII in 1509. Before that date the proceedings in parliament were entered in the Rolls of Parliament , which extend from 1278 to 1503. The journals of the Lords are "records" in the judicial sense; those of the Commons are not. [6] The Hansard , which is available from 1803, contains printed transcripts of parliamentary debates.

United States
The Congressional Record is the official record of the proceedings and debates of the United States Congress . It is published by the United States Government Publishing Office , and is issued when the United States Congress is in session. Indexes are issued approximately every two weeks. At the end of a session of Congress, the daily editions are compiled in bound volumes constituting the permanent edition.
The City Record is the official journal of New York City . [7] It is published each weekday (except legal holidays) and contains legal notices produced by city agencies, including notices of proposed and adopted rules, procurement solicitations and awards, upcoming public hearings and meetings, public auctions and property dispositions, and selected court decisions.

Freedom of information
Freedom of information is an extension of freedom of speech , a fundamental human right recognized in international law , which is today understood more generally as freedom of expression in any medium, be it orally, in writing, print, through the Internet or through art forms. [ citation needed ] This means that the protection of freedom of speech as a right includes not only the content, but also the means of expression. [1] Freedom of information also refers to the right to privacy in the content of the Internet and information technology . As with the right to freedom of expression, the right to privacy is a recognised human right and freedom of information acts as an extension to this right. [2] Lastly, freedom of information can include opposition to patents , opposition to copyrights or opposition to intellectual property in general. [3] The international and United States Pirate Party have established political platforms based largely on freedom of information issues. [4]

In law
In June 2006 nearly 70 countries had freedom of information legislations applying to information held by government bodies and in certain circumstances to private bodies. In 19 of these countries the freedom of information legislation also applied to private bodies. [5] Access to information was increasingly recognised as a prerequisite for transparency and accountability of governments, as facilitating consumers' ability to make informed choices, and as safeguarding citizens against mismanagement and corruption. This has led an increasing number of countries to enact freedom of information legislation in the past 10 years. [6] In recent years, private bodies have started to perform functions which were previously carried out by public bodies. Privatisation and de-regulation saw banks, telecommunications companies, hospitals and universities being run by private entities, leading to demands for the extension of freedom of information legislation to cover private bodies. [7]

Government bodies
As of 2006, 70 countries had comprehensive freedom of information legislation for public bodies, nearly half of which had been enacted in the past 10 years. Such legislation was pending in a further 50 countries. [6]

Private bodies
As of 2006, the following 19 countries had freedom of information legislation that extended to government bodies and private bodies: Antigua and Barbuda , Angola , Armenia , Colombia , the Czech Republic , the Dominican Republic , Estonia , Finland , France , Iceland , Liechtenstein , Panama , Poland , Peru , South Africa , Turkey , Trinidad and Tobago , Slovakia , and the United Kingdom . The degree to which private bodies are covered under freedom of information legislation varies, in Angola, Armenia and Peru the legislation only applies to private companies that perform what are considered to be public functions. In the Czech Republic, the Dominican Republic, Finland, Trinidad and Tobago, Slovakia, Poland and Iceland private bodies that receive public funding are subject to freedom of information legislation. Freedom of information legislation in Estonia, France and UK covers private bodies in certain sectors. [8] In South Africa the access provisions of the Promotion of Access to Information Act have been used by individuals to establish why their loan application has been denied. The access provisions have also been used by minority shareholders in private companies and environmental groups, who were seeking information on the potential environmental damage caused by company projects. [9]

Consumer protection
In 1983 the United Nations Commission on Transnational Corporations adopted the United Nations Guidelines for Consumer Protection stipulating eight consumer rights, including "consumer access to adequate information to enable making informed choices according to individual wishes and needs". Access to information became regarded as a basic consumer right, and preventive disclosure, i.e. the disclosure of information on threats to human lives, health and safety, began to be emphasized. [10]

Investors
Secretive decision making by company directors and corporate scandal led to freedom of information legislation to be published for the benefits of investors. Such legislation was first adopted in Britain in the early 20th century, and later in North America and other countries. [11] Disclosure regimes for the benefit of investors regained attention at the beginning of the 21st century as a number of corporate scandals were linked to accounting fraud and company director secrecy. [12] Starting with Enron, the subsequent scandals involving Worldcom , Tyco , Adelphia and Global Crossing prompted the US Congress to impose new information disclosure obligations on companies with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002. [13]

Internet and information technology
Freedom of information (or information freedom) also refers to the protection of the right to freedom of expression with regard to the Internet and information technology . Freedom of information may also concern censorship in an information technology context, i.e. the ability to access Web content , without censorship or restrictions .

The Information Society and freedom of expression
The World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) Declaration of Principles adopted in 2003 reaffirms democracy and the universality, indivisibility and interdependence of all human rights and fundamental freedoms. The Declaration also makes specific reference to the importance of the right to freedom of expression for the " Information Society " in stating:
The 2004 WSIS Declaration of Principles also acknowledged that "it is necessary to prevent the use of information resources and technologies for criminal and terrorist purposes, while respecting human rights." [15] Wolfgang Benedek comments that the WSIS Declaration only contains a number of references to human rights and does not spell out any procedures or mechanism to assure that human rights are considered in practice. [16]

Hacktivismo
The digital rights group Hacktivismo , founded in 1999, argues that access to information is a basic human right . The group's beliefs are described fully in the "Hacktivismo Declaration" which calls for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) to be applied to the Internet . The Declaration recalls the duty of member states to the ICCPR to protect the right to freedom of expression with regard to the internet and in this context freedom of information. [17] The Hacktivismo Declaration recognises "the importance to fight against human rights abuses with respect to reasonable access to information on the Internet" and calls upon the hacker community to "study ways and means of circumventing state sponsored censorship of the internet" and "implement technologies to challenge information rights violations". The Hacktivismo Declaration does, however, recognise that the right to freedom of expression is subject to limitations, stating "we recognised the right of governments to forbid the publication of properly categorized state secrets , child pornography , and matters related to personal privacy and privilege , among other accepted restrictions." However, the Hacktivismo Declaration states "but we oppose the use of state power to control access to the works of critics, intellectuals , artists , or religious figures." [17]

Global Network Initiative
On October 29, 2008 the Global Network Initiative (GNI) was founded upon its "Principles on Freedom of Expression and Privacy". The Initiative was launched in the 60th Anniversary year of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and is based on internationally recognized laws and standards for human rights on freedom of expression and privacy set out in the UDHR, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR). [18] Participants in the Initiative include the Electronic Frontier Foundation , Human Rights Watch , Google , Microsoft , Yahoo , other major companies, human rights NGOs, investors, and academics. [19] [20]
According to reports Cisco Systems was invited to the initial discussions but didn't take part in the initiative. Harrington Investments , which proposed that Cisco establish a human rights board, has dismissed the GNI as a voluntary code of conduct not having any impact. Chief executive John Harrington called the GNI "meaningless noise" and instead calls for bylaws to be introduced that force boards of directors to accept human rights responsibilities. [21]

Internet censorship
Jo Glanville, editor of the Index on Censorship , states that "the internet has been a revolution for censorship as much as for free speech". [21] The concept of freedom of information has emerged in response to state sponsored censorship, monitoring and surveillance of the internet. Internet censorship includes the control or suppression of the publishing or accessing of information on the Internet .
According to the Reporters without Borders (RSF) "internet enemy list" the following states engage in pervasive internet censorship: Cuba , Iran , Maldives , Myanmar / Burma , North Korea , Syria , Tunisia , Uzbekistan and Vietnam . [22] A widely publicised example is the Great Firewall of China (in reference both to its role as a network firewall and to the ancient Great Wall of China ). The system blocks content by preventing IP addresses from being routed through and consists of standard firewall and proxy servers at the Internet gateways . The system also selectively engages in DNS poisoning when particular sites are requested. The government does not appear to be systematically examining Internet content, as this appears to be technically impractical. [23] Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China is conducted under a wide variety of laws and administrative regulations. In accordance with these laws, more than sixty Internet regulations have been made by the People's Republic of China (PRC) government, and censorship systems are vigorously implemented by provincial branches of state-owned ISPs , business companies, and organizations. [24] [25]
In 2010, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , speaking on behalf of the United States , declared 'we stand for a single internet where all of humanity has equal access to knowledge and ideas'. In her 'Remarks on Internet Freedom' she also draws attention to how 'even in authoritarian countries, information networks are helping people discover new facts and making governments more accountable', while reporting President Barack Obama 's pronouncement 'the more freely information flows, the stronger societies become'.

Permissive software licence
A Permissive software license , sometimes also called BSD-like or BSD-style license, [2] is a FOSS software license with minimal requirements about how the software can be redistributed. Examples include the MIT License , BSD licenses and the Apache license . As of 2016, [update] the most popular FOSS license is the permissive MIT license. [3] [4]

Definitions
The Open Source Initiative defines a permissive software license as a "non- copyleft license ". [5] GitHub 's choosealicense website described the MIT permissive license as, "lets people do anything they want with your code as long as they provide attribution back to you and don’t hold you liable." [6] California Western School of Law 's newmediarights.com defined them as follows: "The ‘BSD-like’ licenses such as the BSD, MIT, and Apache licenses are extremely permissive, requiring little more than attributing the original portions of the licensed code to the original developers in your own code and/or documentation.". [2]

Other terms

Copycenter
Copycenter is a term originally used to explain the modified BSD licence , a permissive free software license. The term was presented by Kirk McKusick , a computer scientist famous for his work on BSD, during one of his speeches at BSDCon 1999. It is a word play on copyright , copyleft and copy center .
The liberty to 'make as many copies as you want' is in fact also provided by all copyleft licenses. However, unlike both copyleft licenses and copyright law, permissive free software licenses do not control the license terms that a derivative work falls under.

Copyfree
The Copyfree Initiative defines Copyfree as a type of permissive copyright license which falls under their Copyfree Standard Definition . [8]
Copyfree licenses include the Simplified BSD licence , the Open Works license, and others, but excludes the GNU GPL or other copyleft licenses. The Creative Commons CC0 public domain dedication and the WTFPL license are also considered to be copyfree, as are other public domain equivalent licenses . [9]
While all copyfree licenses are permissive licenses, not all permissive licenses are copyfree, because they may introduce limitations not allowed under the copyfree definition. Therefore, copyfree can be seen as subset of permissive free licenses, comprising the most permissive of them. The Apache Licence 2.0 (as well as previous versions of Apache license) is an example of a non-copyfree permissive licence. [10] Another notable example is the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license, which is also non-compliant with the Copyfree Standard Definition because the license forbids DRM technologies.

Comparison to public domain
Computer Associates Int'l v. Altai used the term "public domain" to refer to works that have become widely shared and distributed under permission, rather than work that was deliberately put into the public domain. However, permissive licenses are not actually equivalent to releasing a work into the public domain .
Permissive licenses often do stipulate some limited requirements, such as that the original authors must be credited ( attribution ). If a work is truly in the public domain, this is usually not legally required, but a United States copyright registration requires disclosing material that has been previously published, [12] and attribution may still be considered an ethical requirement in academia .

Comparison to copyleft
A major difference between the set of permissive and copyleft free software licenses is that when the software is being redistributed (either modified or unmodified), permissive licenses don't enforce the redistributor to open the modified source code. Copyleft ("sharealike") licenses enforce the publication of the source code under the copyleft license. [13] [14] Some people argue that copyleft licenses see the world as "evil" and therefore enforce "freedoms" ("availability of source code") while permissive licenses see the world as "good", therefore just allowing good actions and hoping for giving back in form of source code. [15] Permissive licenses don't try to guarantee that future generations of the software will remain free and publicly available, in contrast to licenses which have reciprocity / share-alike requirements which try to enforce this.
The FreeBSD project argues on the advantages of permissive licenses for companies and commercial use-cases: they place only "minimal restrictions on future behavior" and aren't "legal time-bombs" , unlike copyleft licenses. [16]
Also permissive licenses have often an excellent licence compatibility , [17] [18] in comparison to copyleft licenses who can't be always freely combined and mixed. [19] [20] However, most GPLv2 licensed software allows to upgrade to the terms of later versions of the GPL, achieving by that a somewhat better inter-GPL compatibility. Also, some copyleft licenses have exception clauses that allow combining them with software that is under different licenses or license versions. [21]

License compatibility
In general permissive licenses show a good licence compatibility with most other software licenses in most situations. [17] [18]
Due to their non-restrictiveness most permissive software licenses are even compatible with copyleft licenses, which are incompatible with most other licenses. Copyleft licenses don't allow the addition of additional restrictive clauses which would be often required in a combined work made from copyleft code and other licensed code. Only some older permissive licenses have clauses requiring advertising materials to credit the copyright holder which made them incompatible with copyleft licenses, for instance the 4-clause BSD license , the PHP Licence , and the OpenSSL License . Popular modern permissive licenses, as the MIT Licence , the 3-clause BSD licence , and the Zlib Licence , don't include advertising clauses and are compatible with many copyleft licenses.
Some licenses do not allow derived works to add a restriction that says a redistributor cannot add more restrictions. Examples include the CDDL and MsPL . However such restrictions also make the license incompatible with permissive free software licenses.
Some licenses are permissive but do not qualify as free software licenses as defined by the Free Software Foundation .

Reception and adoption
While always an important part of the FOSS license landscape, in the 2010s years several authors noted a raising popularity of the permissive licenses in contrast to the copyleft license. [23] [24] [25] [26]
As of 2015, [update] the MIT licence, a permissive license, is the most popular license in the FOSS domain before a copyleft one, the second placed GPLv2 . [3] [4]

Duke University
Duke University is an American private research university located in Durham, North Carolina . Founded by Methodists and Quakers in the present-day town of Trinity in 1838, the school moved to Durham in 1892. [9] In 1924, tobacco and electric power industrialist James Buchanan Duke established The Duke Endowment , at which time the institution changed its name to honor his deceased father, Washington Duke .
Duke's campus spans over 8,600 acres (3,500 hectares) on three contiguous campuses in Durham as well as a marine lab in Beaufort . The main campus—designed largely by architect Julian Abele —incorporates Gothic architecture with the 210-foot (64-meter) Duke Chapel at the campus' center and highest point of elevation. The first-year-populated East Campus contains Georgian -style architecture, while the main Gothic-style West Campus 1.5 miles (2.4 kilometers) away is adjacent to the Medical Center . Duke is the seventh-wealthiest private university in America with $11.4 billion in cash and investments in fiscal year 2014. [10]
Duke's research expenditures in the 2015 fiscal year were $1.037 billion, the seventh largest in the nation. [11] In 2014, Thomson Reuters named 32 of Duke's professors to its list of Highly Cited Researchers , making it fourth globally in terms of primary affiliations. [12] Duke also ranks fifth among national universities to have produced Rhodes , Marshall , Truman , Goldwater , and Udall Scholars. [13] Ten Nobel laureates and three Turing Award winners are affiliated with the university. Duke's sports teams compete in the Atlantic Coast Conference and the basketball team is renowned for having won five NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championships , most recently in 2015.
Duke is consistently included among the best universities in the world by numerous university rankings, [14] [15] [16] and among the most innovative, according to a Reuters survey. [17] According to a Forbes study, Duke is ranked 11th among universities that have produced billionaires. [18] [19] In a New York Times corporate study, Duke's graduates were shown to be among the most sought-after and valued in the world, [20] and Forbes magazine ranked Duke seventh in the world on its list of 'power factories' in 2012. [21]

History

Beginnings
Duke started in 1838 as Brown's Schoolhouse, a private subscription school founded in Randolph County in the present-day town of Trinity . [22] Organized by the Union Institute Society, a group of Methodists and Quakers, Brown's Schoolhouse became the Union Institute Academy in 1841 when North Carolina issued a charter. The academy was renamed Normal College in 1851 and then Trinity College in 1859 because of support from the Methodist Church . [22] In 1892, Trinity College moved to Durham, largely due to generosity from Julian S. Carr and Washington Duke , powerful and respected Methodists who had grown wealthy through the tobacco and electrical industries. [9] Carr donated land in 1892 for the original Durham campus, which is now known as East Campus. At the same time, Washington Duke gave the school $85,000 for an initial endowment and construction costs—later augmenting his generosity with three separate $100,000 contributions in 1896, 1899, and 1900—with the stipulation that the college "open its doors to women, placing them on an equal footing with men." [23]
In 1924 Washington Duke's son, James B. Duke , established The Duke Endowment with a $40 million trust fund. Income from the fund was to be distributed to hospitals, orphanages, the Methodist Church, and four colleges (including Trinity College). William Preston Few , the president of Trinity at the time, insisted that the institution be renamed Duke University to honor the family's generosity and to distinguish it from the myriad other colleges and universities carrying the "Trinity" name. At first, James B. Duke thought the name change would come off as self-serving, but eventually he accepted Few's proposal as a memorial to his father. [9] Money from the endowment allowed the University to grow quickly. Duke's original campus, East Campus, was rebuilt from 1925 to 1927 with Georgian -style buildings. By 1930, the majority of the Collegiate Gothic -style buildings on the campus one mile (1.6 km) west were completed, and construction on West Campus culminated with the completion of Duke Chapel in 1935. [24]
In 1878, Trinity (in Randolph County) awarded A.B. degrees to three sisters—Mary, Persis, and Theresa Giles—who had studied both with private tutors and in classes with men. With the relocation of the college in 1892, the Board of Trustees voted to again allow women to be formally admitted to classes as day students. At the time of Washington Duke's donation in 1896, which carried the requirement that women be placed "on an equal footing with men" at the college, four women were enrolled; three of the four were faculty members' children. In 1903 Washington Duke wrote to the Board of Trustees withdrawing the provision, noting that it had been the only limitation he had ever put on a donation to the college. A woman's residential dormitory was built in 1897 and named the Mary Duke Building, after Washington Duke's daughter. By 1904, fifty-four women were enrolled in the college. In 1930, the Woman's College was established as a coordinate to the men's undergraduate college, which had been established and named Trinity College in 1924. [25]

Expansion and growth
Engineering , which had been taught since 1903, became a separate school in 1939. In athletics, Duke hosted and competed in the only Rose Bowl ever played outside California in Wallace Wade Stadium in 1942. [26] During World War II , Duke was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a Navy commission. [27] In 1963 the Board of Trustees officially desegregated the undergraduate college. [28] Increased activism on campus during the 1960s prompted Martin Luther King Jr. to speak at the University in November 1964 on the progress of the Civil Rights Movement . Following Douglas Knight 's resignation from the office of university president, Terry Sanford , the former governor of North Carolina, was elected president of the university in 1969, propelling The Fuqua School of Business ' opening, the William R. Perkins library completion, and the founding of the Institute of Policy Sciences and Public Affairs (now the Sanford School of Public Policy). The separate Woman's College merged back with Trinity as the liberal arts college for both men and women in 1972. Beginning in the 1970s, Duke administrators began a long-term effort to strengthen Duke's reputation both nationally and internationally. Interdisciplinary work was emphasized, as was recruiting minority faculty and students. During this time it also became the birthplace of the first Physician Assistant degree program in the United States. [29] [30] [31] Duke University Hospital was finished in 1980 and the student union building was fully constructed two years later. In 1986 the men's soccer team captured Duke's first National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) championship, and the men's basketball team followed shortly thereafter with championships in 1991 and 1992 , then again in 2001 , 2010 , and 2015 .

Recent history
Duke's growth and academic focus have contributed to continuing the university's reputation as an academic and research powerhouse. [33]
In summer 2014, Duke Kunshan University (DKU) opened in Kunshan , China . DKU blends liberal education with Chinese tradition in a new approach to elite higher education in China. DKU will conduct research projects on climate change, health-care policy and tuberculosis prevention and control. [34]
In August 2005, Duke established a partnership with the National University of Singapore to develop a joint medical program, which had its first entering class in 2007. [35]
The university is part way through Duke Forward, a seven-year fundraising campaign that aims to raise $3.25 billion by June 30, 2017, to enrich the student experience in and out of the classroom, invest in faculty and support research and initiatives. Every dollar donated to Duke's ten schools and units, Duke Medicine or university programs and initiatives counts toward the campaign's goal. [36]
Among academic achievements at Duke, three students were named Rhodes Scholars in both 2002 and 2006, a number surpassed only by Harvard in 2002 and the United States Military Academy in 2006. [37] [38] Overall, Duke has produced 45 Rhodes Scholars through 2015, including 24 between 1990 and 2015.
Also, the first working demonstration of an invisibility cloak was unveiled by Duke researchers in October 2006. [39] In 2006, three men's lacrosse team members were falsely accused of rape , which garnered significant media attention . On April 11, 2007, North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper dropped all charges and declared the three players innocent. Cooper stated that the charged players were victims of a "tragic rush to accuse."
The university has "historical, formal, ongoing, and symbolic ties" with the United Methodist Church , but is a nonsectarian and independent institution. [40] [41] [42] [43]

Campus
Duke University owns 254 buildings on 8,691 acres (35.17 km 2 ) of land, which includes the 7,044 acres (28.51 km 2 ) Duke Forest. [6] The campus is divided into four main areas: West, East, and Central campuses and the Medical Center, which are all connected via a free bus service. On the Atlantic coast in Beaufort , Duke owns 15 acres (61,000 m 2 ) as part of its marine lab. One of the major public attractions on the main campus is the 55-acre (220,000 m 2 ) Sarah P. Duke Gardens , established in the 1930s. [6]
Duke students often refer to the campus as "the Gothic Wonderland," a nickname referring to the Collegiate Gothic architecture of West Campus. [44] [45] Much of the campus was designed by Julian Abele , one of the first prominent African-American architects and the chief designer in the offices of architect Horace Trumbauer . [46] The residential quadrangles are of an early and somewhat unadorned design, while the buildings in the academic quadrangles show influences of the more elaborate late French and Italian styles. The freshmen campus (East Campus) is composed of buildings in the Georgian architecture style. In 2011, Travel+Leisure listed Duke among the most beautiful college campuses in the United States. [47]
The stone used for West Campus has seven primary colors and seventeen shades of color. [48] The university supervisor of planning and construction wrote that the stone has "an older, more attractive antique effect" and a "warmer and softer coloring than the Princeton stone " that gave the university an "artistic look." [48] James B. Duke initially suggested the use of stone from a quarry in Princeton , New Jersey , but later amended the plans to purchase a local quarry in Hillsborough to reduce costs. [48] Duke Chapel stands at the center of West Campus on the highest ridge. Constructed from 1930 to 1935, the chapel seats 1,600 people and, at 210 feet (64 m) is one of the tallest buildings in Durham County . [49]
A number of construction projects were in progress during 2015, including renovations to Duke Chapel, Wallace Wade Stadium (football) and Cameron Indoor Stadium (basketball). [50]
In early 2014, the Nicholas School of the Environment opened a new home, Environmental Hall, [51] a five-story, glass-and-concrete building that incorporates the highest sustainable features and technologies, and meets or exceeds the criteria for LEED platinum certification. The School of Nursing in April 2014 opened a new 45,000-square-foot addition to the Christine Siegler Pearson Building. [52] In summer 2014, a number of construction projects were completed or else in full swing, including renovations to the David M. Rubenstein Rare Book & Manuscript Library, housed in Duke's original West Campus library building. [53] The project is part of the final phase of renovations to Duke's West Campus libraries that will transform one of the university's oldest and most recognizable buildings into a state-of-the-art research facility. Renovation work began in late 2012; opening is scheduled for 2015.
In 2013, construction projects included transforming buildings like Gross Hall and Baldwin Auditorium, plus new construction such as the Events Pavilion. About 125,000 square feet was updated at Gross Hall, including new lighting and windows and a skylight. [54] Baldwin's upgrades include a larger stage, more efficient air conditioning for performers and audience and enhanced acoustics that will allow for the space to be "tuned" to each individual performance. [55] The 25,000-square-foot Events Pavilion opened to students in 2013 and serves as temporary dining space while the West Campus Union undergoes major renovations, expected to be completed in the spring of 2016. From February 2001 to November 2005, Duke spent $835 million on 34 major construction projects as part of a five-year strategic plan, "Building on Excellence." [56] Completed projects since 2002 include major additions to the business, law, nursing, and divinity schools, a new library, the Nasher Museum of Art , a football training facility, two residential buildings, an engineering complex, a public policy building, an eye institute, two genetic research buildings, a student plaza, the French Family Science Center, and two new medical-research buildings. [57]
In early 2012, the Duke Cancer Center opened next to Duke Hospital in Durham. [58] The patient care facility consolidates nearly all of Duke's outpatient clinical care services.

West, East, and Central Campuses
West Campus, considered the main campus of the University, houses the majority of the sophomores, along with some juniors and seniors. [59] Most of the academic and administrative centers are located there. Main West Campus, with Duke Chapel at its center, contains the majority of residential quads to the south, while the main academic quad, library, and Medical Center are to the north. The campus, spanning 720 acres (2.9 km 2 ), includes Science Drive, which is the location of science and engineering buildings. The residential quads on West Campus are Craven Quad, Crowell Quad, Edens Quad, Few Quad, Keohane Quad, Kilgo Quad, and Wannamaker Quad. [60] Most of the campus eateries and sports facilities—including the historic basketball stadium, Cameron Indoor Stadium —are on West Campus. [61]
East Campus, the original location of Duke after it moved to Durham, [62] functions as a first-year campus, housing the university's freshmen dormitories as well as the home of several academic departments. Since the 1995–96 academic year, all freshmen—and only freshmen, except for upperclassmen serving as Resident Assistants—have lived on East Campus, an effort to build class unity. The campus encompasses 97 acres (390,000 m 2 ) and is 1.5 miles (2.4 km) from West Campus. [6] African and African American Studies, Art History, History, Cultural Anthropology, Literature, Music, Philosophy, and Women's Studies are housed on East. [62] Programs such as dance, drama, education, film, and the University Writing Program reside on East. The self-sufficient East Campus contains the freshmen residence halls, a dining hall, coffee shop, post office, Lilly Library, Baldwin Auditorium, a theater, Brodie Gym, tennis courts, several disc golf baskets, and a walking track as well as several academic buildings. [62] The East Campus dorms are Alspaugh, Basset, Bell Tower, Blackwell, Brown, East House (formerly known as Aycock), Epworth, Gilbert-Addoms, Giles, Jarvis, Pegram, Randolph, Southgate, and Wilson. [63] Separated from downtown by a short walk, the area was the site of the Women's College from 1930 to 1972. [62]
Central Campus, consisting of 122 acres (0.49 km 2 ) between East and West campuses, houses around 1,000 sophomores, juniors, and seniors, as well as around 200 professional students in double or quadruple apartments. [64] There are 26 specific houses, accommodating 22 selective living groups (sororities and fraternities), 3 independent houses and 1 administrative house. [64] Central Campus is home to the Nasher Museum of Art , the Freeman Center for Jewish Life, the Center for Muslim Life, the Duke Police Department, the Duke Office of Disability Management, a Ronald McDonald House , and administrative departments such as Duke Residence Life and Housing Services. Central Campus has several recreation and social facilities such as basketball courts, a sand volleyball court, a turf field, barbecue grills and picnic shelters, a general gathering building called "Devil's Den," a restaurant known as "Devil's Bistro," a convenience store called Uncle Harry's, and the Mill Village. The Mill Village consists of a gym and group study rooms. [64] [65]

Key places
Duke Forest, established in 1931, consists of 7,044 acres (28.51 km 2 ) in six divisions, just west of West Campus. [6] The largest private research forest in North Carolina and one of the largest in the nation, [66] the Duke Forest demonstrates a variety of forest stand types and silvicultural treatments. Duke Forest is used extensively for research and includes the Aquatic Research Facility, Forest Carbon Transfer and Storage (FACTS-I) research facility, two permanent towers suitable for micrometerological studies, and other areas designated for animal behavior and ecosystem study. [67] More than 30 miles (48 km) of trails are open to the public for hiking, cycling, and horseback riding. [68]
The Duke Lemur Center , located inside the Duke Forest, is the world's largest sanctuary for rare and endangered strepsirrhine primates. [69] Founded in 1966, the Duke Lemur Center spans 85 acres (34 ha) and contains nearly 300 animals of 25 different species of lemurs , galagos and lorises . [70]
The Sarah P. Duke Gardens , established in the early 1930s, is situated between West Campus and the apartments of Central Campus. The gardens occupy 55 acres (22 ha), divided into four major sections: [71] the original Terraces and their surroundings; the H.L. Blomquist Garden of Native Plants, devoted to flora of the Southeastern United States; the W.L. Culberson Asiatic Arboretum, housing plants of Eastern Asia, as well as disjunct species found in Eastern Asia and Eastern North America; and the Doris Duke Center Gardens. There are five miles (8 km) of allées and paths throughout the gardens. [71]
Duke University Medical Center , bordering Duke's West Campus northern boundary, combines one of the top-rated hospitals [72] and one of the top-ranked medical schools [73] in the U.S. Founded in 1930, the Medical Center occupies 8 million square feet (700,000 m²) in 99 buildings on 210 acres (85 ha). [74]
Duke University Marine Laboratory, located in the town of Beaufort, North Carolina , is also technically part of Duke's campus. The marine lab is situated on Pivers Island on the Outer Banks of North Carolina, 150 yards (140 m) across the channel from Beaufort. Duke's interest in the area began in the early 1930s and the first buildings were erected in 1938. [75] The resident faculty represent the disciplines of oceanography, marine biology, marine biomedicine, marine biotechnology, and coastal marine policy and management. The Marine Laboratory is a member of the National Association of Marine Laboratories. [75] In May 2014, the newly built Orrin H. Pilkey Marine Research Laboratory was dedicated. [76]

Administration and organization
Duke University has 12 schools and institutes, two of which are for undergraduates: Trinity College of Arts and Sciences and Pratt School of Engineering . [6]
Duke's endowment had a market value of $6.84 billion in the fiscal year that ended June 30, 2016. [4] The University's special academic facilities include an art museum , several language labs, the Duke Forest, the Duke Herbarium, a lemur center , a phytotron , a free electron laser, a nuclear magnetic resonance machine, a nuclear lab, and a marine lab. Duke is a leading participant in the National Lambda Rail Network and runs a program for gifted children known as the Talent Identification Program . [77] [78]

Academics

Admissions
Admission to Duke is defined by U.S. News & World Report as "most selective"; Duke received 34,400 applications for the Class of 2021 and admitted 3,174 (9%) of applicants. [79] According to The Huffington Post , Duke was one of the ten toughest universities in the United States to get into based on admissions data from 2010. [80] The yield rate (the percentage of accepted students who choose to attend) for the Class of 2020 was 50.4%. [79] For the class of 2019, the middle 50% range of SAT scores for the freshmen enrolling in fall 2015 was 670–760 for critical reading, 690–790 for math, and 690–780 for writing, while the ACT Composite range was 31–34. [81]
From 2001 to 2011, Duke has had the sixth highest number of Fulbright , Rhodes , Truman , and Goldwater scholarships in the nation among private universities. [82] [83] [84] [85] The University practices need-blind admissions and meets 100% of admitted students' demonstrated need. About 50 percent of all Duke students receive some form of financial aid, which includes need-based aid, athletic aid, and merit aid. The average need-based grant for the 2015–16 academic year was nearly $45,074. [6] Roughly 60 merit-based scholarships are also offered, including the Angier B. Duke Memorial Scholarship, awarded for academic excellence. Other scholarships are geared toward students in North Carolina, African-American students, and high-achieving students requiring financial aid. [86]

Graduate profile
In 2009, the School of Medicine received 5,166 applications [87] and accepted approximately 4% of them, [88] while the average GPA and MCAT scores for accepted students from 2002 through 2009 were 3.74 and 34, respectively. [89] [90] The School of Law accepted approximately 13% of its applicants for the Class of 2014, while enrolling students had a median GPA of 3.75 and median LSAT of 170. [91]
The University's graduate and professional schools include the Graduate School , the Pratt School of Engineering , the Nicholas School of the Environment , the School of Medicine , the Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School , the School of Nursing , the Fuqua School of Business , the School of Law , the Divinity School , and the Sanford School of Public Policy . [92]

Undergraduate curriculum
Duke offers 46 arts and sciences majors, four engineering majors, 52 Minors (including two in engineering) and Program II, which allows students to design their own interdisciplinary major in arts & sciences, and IDEAS, which allows students to design their own engineering major. [93] Twenty-four certificate programs also are available. [93] Students pursue a major, and can pursue a combination of a total of up to three including minors, certificates, and/or a second major. Eighty-five percent of undergraduates enroll in the Trinity College of Arts and Sciences , while the rest are in the Pratt School of Engineering . [94]
Trinity's curriculum operates under the revised version of "Curriculum 2000." [95] It ensures that students are exposed to a variety of "areas of knowledge" and "modes of inquiry." The curriculum aims to help students develop critical faculties and judgment by learning how to access, synthesize, and communicate knowledge effectively. The intent is to assist students in acquiring perspective on current and historical events, conducting research and solving problems, and developing tenacity and a capacity for hard and sustained work. [95] Freshmen can elect to participate in the FOCUS Program , which allows students to engage in an interdisciplinary exploration of a specific topic in a small group setting. [96]
Pratt's curriculum is narrower in scope, but still accommodates double majors in a variety of disciplines. The school emphasizes undergraduate research—opportunities for hands-on experiences arise through internships, fellowship programs, and the structured curriculum. More than 27 percent of Pratt undergraduates study abroad, [97] small compared to about half of Trinity undergraduates, but much larger than the recent national average for engineering students (3.2%). [98] [99]

Libraries and museums
Duke Libraries includes the Perkins, Bostock, and Rubenstein Libraries on West Campus, the Lilly and Music Libraries on East Campus, the Pearse Memorial Library at the Duke Marine Lab, and the separately administered libraries serving the schools of business, divinity, law and medicine.
Duke's art collections are housed at the Nasher Museum of Art on Central Campus. The museum was designed by Rafael Viñoly and is named for Duke alumnus and art collector Raymond Nasher . The museum opened in 2005 at a cost of over $23 million and contains over 13,000 works of art, including works by William Cordova, Marlene Dumas, Olafur Eliasson, David Hammons, Barkley L. Hendricks, Christian Marclay, Kerry James Marshall, D Alma Thomas, Hank Willis Thomas, Bob Thompson, Kara Walker, Andy Warhol, Carrie Mae Weems, Ai Weiwei, Fred Wilson and Lynette Yiadom Boakye. [100]

Research
Duke's research expenditures in the 2015 fiscal year were $1.037 billion, the seventh largest in the nation. [11] In the 2013 fiscal year , Duke University Medical Center received $270 million in funding from the National Institutes of Health (exclusive of contracts and Economic Stimulus Program awards).
Duke's faculty is among the most productive in the nation. Throughout the school's history, Duke researchers have made breakthroughs, including the biomedical engineering department's development of the world's first real-time, three-dimensional ultrasound diagnostic system and the first engineered blood vessels and stents. [101] In 2015, Paul Modrich shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. In 2012, Robert Lefkowitz along with Brian Kobilka , who is also a former affiliate, shared the Nobel Prize in chemistry for their work on cell surface receptors. [102] In the mechanical engineering department, Adrian Bejan developed the constructal theory , which explains the shapes that arise in nature. Duke has pioneered studies involving nonlinear dynamics, chaos, and complex systems in physics. In May 2006 Duke researchers mapped the final human chromosome, which made world news as the Human Genome Project was finally complete. [103] Reports of Duke researchers' involvement in new AIDS vaccine research surfaced in June 2006. [104] The biology department combines two historically strong programs in botany and zoology, while one of the divinity school's leading theologians is Stanley Hauerwas , whom Time named "America's Best Theologian" in 2001. [105] The graduate program in literature boasts several internationally renowned figures, including Fredric Jameson , [106] Michael Hardt , [107] and Rey Chow , while philosophers Robert Brandon and Lakatos Award -winner Alexander Rosenberg contribute to Duke's ranking as the nation's best program in philosophy of biology, according to the Philosophical Gourmet Report . [108]
The Faculty Scholarly Productivity Index ranked Duke's faculty first in the nation in the fields of Oncology and Cancer Biology, Biomedical Engineering and, Applied Economics. The Public Policy, Statistics, Chemistry, Environmental Science, Medicine and Molecular Genetics departments (among others) all ranked in the top five. Several other departments including Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and Nursing ranked in the top ten. [109]

Student life

Student body
Duke's student body consists of 6,449 undergraduates and 8,383 graduate and professional students (as of fall 2016). [6]

Residential life
Duke requires its students to live on campus for the first three years of undergraduate life, except for a small percentage of second-semester juniors who are exempted by a lottery system. [59] This requirement is justified by the administration as an effort to help students connect more closely with one another and sustain a sense of belonging within the Duke community. [162] Thus, 85% of undergraduates live on campus. [163] All freshmen are housed in one of 14 residences on East Campus. These buildings range in occupancy size from 50 (Epworth—the oldest residence hall, built in 1892 as "the Inn") to 190 residents (Gilbert-Addoms). [164] [165] Most of these are in the Georgian style typical of the East Campus architecture. Although the newer residence halls differ in style, they still relate to East's Georgian heritage. Learning communities connect the residential component of East Campus with students of similar academic and social interests. [166] Similarly, students in FOCUS , a first-year program that features courses clustered around a specific theme, live together in the same residence hall as other students in their cluster. [167]
Sophomores, juniors and seniors can choose to reside on either West or Central campuses, although the majority of undergraduate seniors choose to live off campus. [168] [169] West Campus contains six quadrangles—the four along "Main" West were built in 1930s, while two newer ones have since been added. Central Campus provides housing for over 1,000 students in apartment buildings. [170] All housing on West and Central is organized into about 80 "houses"—sections of residence halls or clusters of apartments—to which students can return each year. House residents create their house identities. There are houses of unaffiliated students, as well as wellness houses and living-learning communities that adopt a theme such as the arts or foreign languages. There are also numerous "selective living groups" on campus for students wanting self-selected living arrangements. SLGs are residential groups similar to fraternities or sororities, except they are generally co-ed and unaffiliated with any national organization. Many of them also revolve around a particular interest such as entrepreneurship, civic engagement or African-American or Asian culture. Fifteen fraternities and nine sororities also are housed on campus, primarily on Central. Most of the non-fraternity selective living groups are coeducational. [171]

Greek and social life
About 30% of undergraduate men and about 40% of undergraduate women at Duke are members of fraternities and sororities . [163] Most of the 17 Interfraternity Council recognized fraternity chapters live in sections within the residence halls. Starting in 2012, the nine Panhellenic Association sorority chapters decided to live in houses (clusters of apartments) on Central Campus. Not all sorority members live with their chapters, though, as membership exceeds house space. Eight National Pan-Hellenic Council (historically African American) fraternities and sororities also hold chapters at Duke. [172] In addition, there are seven other fraternities and sororities that are a part of the Inter-Greek Council, the multicultural Greek umbrella organization. [173] Duke also has Selective Living Groups, or SLGs, on campus for students seeking informal residential communities often built around themes. SLGs are residential groups similar to fraternities or sororities, except they are generally co-ed and unaffiliated with any national organizations. [174] Fraternity chapters and SLGs frequently host social events in their residential sections, which are often open to non-members. [175]
In the late 1990s, a new keg policy was put into effect that requires all student groups to purchase kegs through Duke Dining Services. According to administrators, the rule change was intended as a way to ensure compliance with alcohol consumption laws as well as to increase on-campus safety. [176] Some students saw the administration's increasingly strict policies as an attempt to alter social life at Duke. [177] As a result, off-campus parties at rented houses became more frequent in subsequent years as a way to avoid Duke policies. Many of these houses were situated in the midst of family neighborhoods, prompting residents to complain about excessive noise and other violations. Police have responded by breaking up parties at several houses, handing out citations, and occasionally arresting party-goers. [178] In the mid-to-late 2000s (decade), the administration made a concerted effort to help students re-establish a robust, on-campus social life and has worked with numerous student groups, especially the Duke University Union, to feature a wide array of events and activities. In March 2006, the university purchased 15 houses in the Trinity Park area that Duke students had typically rented and subsequently sold them to individual families in an effort to encourage renovations to the properties and to reduce off-campus partying in the midst of residential neighborhoods. [179] [180]
Duke athletics, particularly men's basketball, traditionally serves as a significant component of student life. Duke's students have been recognized as some of the most creative and original fans in all of collegiate athletics. [181] Students, often referred to as Cameron Crazies , show their support of the men's basketball team by "tenting" for home games against key Atlantic Coast Conference rivals, especially University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC). [182] Because tickets to all varsity sports are free to students, they line up for hours before each game, often spending the night on the sidewalk. For a mid-February game against UNC, some of the most eager students might even begin tenting before spring classes begin. [183] The total number of participating tents is capped at 100 (each tent can have up to 12 occupants), though interest is such that it could exceed that number if space permitted. [184] Tenting involves setting up and inhabiting a tent on the grass near Cameron Indoor Stadium , an area known as Krzyzewskiville , or K-Ville for short. There are different categories of tenting based on the length of time and number of people who must be in the tent. [184] At night, K-Ville often turns into the scene of a party or occasional concert. The men's basketball coach, Mike Krzyzewski , occasionally buys pizza for the inhabitants of the tent village. [185]

Activities

Student organizations
More than 400 student clubs and organizations operate on Duke's campus. [186] These include numerous student government, special interest, and service organizations. [187] Duke Student Government (DSG) charters and provides most of the funding for other student groups and represents students' interests when dealing with the administration. [188] The Duke University Union (DUU) is the school's primary programming organization, serving a center of social, cultural, intellectual and recreational life. [189] Cultural groups are provided funding directly from the university via the Multicultural Center as well as other institutional funding sources. One of the most popular activities on campus is competing in sports. Duke has 37 sports clubs , and several intramural teams that are officially recognized. Performance groups such as Hoof 'n' Horn, the country's second-oldest student-run musical theater organization, a cappella groups, student bands, and theater organizations are also prominent on campus. [190] As of the 2016–2017 school year, there are seven a cappella groups recognized by the Duke University A Cappella Council: Deja Blue, Lady Blue, Out of the Blue, the Pitchforks, Rhythm & Blue, Something Borrowed Something Blue, and Speak of the Devil. [191] The Duke University mock trial team won the national championship in 2012. [192] The Duke University Student Dining Advisory Committee provides guidance to the administration on issues regarding student dining, life, and restaurant choices.
Cultural groups on campus include the Asian Students Association, Blue Devils United (the student lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender group), Black Student Alliance, Diya (South Asian Association), Jewish Life at Duke, Mi Gente (Latino Student Association), International Association/International Council, Muslim Student Association, Native American Student Coalition, Newman Catholic Student Center, Languages Dorm, and Students of the Caribbean. [186] [193]

Civic engagement
More than 75 percent of Duke students pursue service-learning opportunities in Durham and around the world through DukeEngage and other programs that advance the university's mission of "knowledge in service to society." Launched in 2007, DukeEngage provides full funding for select Duke undergraduates who wish to pursue an immersive summer of service in partnership with a U.S. or international community. As of summer 2013, more than 2,400 Duke students had volunteered through DukeEngage in 75 nations on six continents. Duke students have created more than 30 service organizations in Durham and the surrounding area. Examples include a weeklong camp for children of cancer patients ( Camp Kesem ) and a group that promotes awareness about sexual health, rape prevention, alcohol and drug use, and eating disorders (Healthy Devils). The Duke-Durham Neighborhood Partnership, started by the Office of Community Affairs in 1996, attempts to address major concerns of local residents and schools by leveraging university resources. [194] Another community project, "Scholarship with a Civic Mission," is a joint program between the Hart Leadership Program and the Kenan Institute for Ethics . [195] Another program includes Project CHILD, a tutoring program involving 80 first-year volunteers; and an after-school program for at-risk students in Durham that was started with $2.25 million grant from the Kellogg Foundation in 2002. [196] Two prominent civic engagement pre-orientation programs also exist for incoming freshmen: Project CHANGE and Project BUILD. Project CHANGE is a free weeklong program co-sponsored by the Kenan Institute for Ethics and the Duke Women's Center with the focus on ethical leadership and social change in the Durham community; students are challenged in a variety of ways and work closely with local non-profits. [197] Project BUILD is a freshman volunteering group that dedicates 3,300 hours of service to a variety of projects such as schools, Habitat for Humanity, food banks, substance rehabilitation centers, homeless shelters. Some courses at Duke incorporate service as part of the curriculum to augment material learned in class such as in psychology or education courses (known as service learning courses). [198]

Student media
The Chronicle , Duke's independent undergraduate daily newspaper, has been continually published since 1905 and now, along with its website, has a readership of about 70,000. [199] Its editors are responsible for selecting the term " Blue Devil ". The newspaper won Best in Show in the tabloid division at the 2005 Associated Collegiate Press National College Media Convention. [200] Cable 13 , established in 1976, is Duke's student-run television station. It is a popular activity for students interested in film production and media. [201] WXDU-FM , licensed in 1983, is the university's nationally recognized, noncommercial FM radio station, operated by student and community volunteers. [202] [203]

Athletics
The Duke University Athletic Association chairs 27 sports and more than 650 student-athletes. The Blue Devils are members of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I level, the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) and Atlantic Coast Conference. Men's sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, fencing, football, golf, lacrosse, soccer, swimming & diving, tennis, track & field and wrestling; while women's sports include basketball, cross country, fencing, field hockey, golf, lacrosse, rowing, soccer, softball, swimming & diving, tennis, track & field and volleyball.
Duke's teams have won 16 NCAA team national championships—the women's golf team has won six (1999, 2002, 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2014), the men's basketball team has won five ( 1991 , 1992 , 2001 , 2010 , and 2015 ), the men's lacrosse team has won three ( 2010 , 2013 , and 2014 ), and the men's soccer ( 1986 ) and women's tennis ( 2009 ) teams have won one each. [204]
Duke consistently ranks among the top in the National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics (NACDA) Directors' Cup , an overall measure of an institution's athletic success. For Division I in 2015, Duke finished 20th overall and fifth in the ACC. The Blue Devils have finished within the top 10 six times since the inception of the Cup in 1993–94. Also, Athletic Director Kevin White earned multiple awards in 2014, including the National Football Foundation 's John L. Toner Award and the Sport Business Journal 's Athletic Director of the Year award.
Duke has won 130 ACC Championships since claiming football, men's lacrosse and men's golf in the league's first year in 1953–54 and counting Duke's ACC Championships in men's basketball, men's golf and women's golf in 2016-17.
On the academic front, nine Duke varsity athletics programs registered a perfect 1,000 score in the NCAA's multi-year Academic Progress Report (APR) released in April 2016. In all, Duke totaled the highest APR score among ACC institutions in 12 of the league’s sports – baseball (993), men’s cross country (1000), women’s cross country (1000), women’s fencing (1000), football (995), men’s golf (1000), women’s golf (1000), women’s lacrosse (1000), men’s tennis (1000), women’s track and field (1000), volleyball (1000) and wrestling (977). Also, eight additional Duke programs ranked among the ACC’s top three in their respective sports.
Since the beginning of the 2011-12 school year, Duke has had 2,378 ACC Honor Roll members, 67 CoSIDA Academic All-District selections, 33 CoSIDA Academic All-America picks, 24 ACC Postgraduate scholarship winners and 22 ACC Scholar Athletes of the Year.

Men's basketball
Duke's men's basketball team is one of the nation's most successful basketball programs. The team has captured five National Championships (tied for third place all time), while competing in 16 Final Fours and 12 Championship games. The program's home facility is historic Cameron Indoor Stadium, considered one of the top venues in the nation.
The team's success has been particularly outstanding over the past 30 years under coach Mike Krzyzewski (often simply called "Coach K"). The Blue Devils are the only team to win five national championships since the NCAA Tournament field was expanded to 64 teams in 1985, 11 Final Fours in the past 25 years, and eight of nine ACC tournament championships from 1999 to 2006. Duke's 2017 NCAA tournament appearance ended in an upset to the University of South Carolina. Coach K has also coached the USA men's national basketball team since 2006 and led the team to Olympic golds in 2008 , 2012 , and 2016. His teams also won World Championship gold in 2010 and 2014 .

Football
The Blue Devils have won seven ACC Football Championships , have had ten players honored as ACC Player of the Year (the most in the ACC), [205] and have had three Pro Football Hall of Famers come through the program (second in the ACC to only Miami's four). The Blue Devils have produced 11 College Football Hall of Famers, which is tied for the 2nd most in the ACC. Duke has also won 18 total conference championships (7 ACC, 9 Southern Conference, and 1 Big Five Conference). That total is tied with Clemson for the highest in the ACC. [206]
The most famous Duke football season came in 1938, [207] when Wallace Wade coached the "Iron Dukes" that shut out all regular season opponents; only three teams in history can claim such a feat. [208] That same year, Duke made their first Rose Bowl appearance, where they lost 7–3 when USC scored a touchdown in the final minute of the game. [207] Wade's Blue Devils lost another Rose Bowl to Oregon State in 1942, this one held at Duke's home stadium due to the attack on Pearl Harbor, which resulted in the fear that a large gathering on the West Coast might be in range of Japanese aircraft carriers. [209] The football program proved successful in the 1950s and 1960s, winning six of the first ten ACC football championships from 1953 to 1962 under coach Bill Murray ; the Blue Devils would not win the ACC championship again until 1989 under coach Steve Spurrier . [210]
David Cutcliffe was brought in prior to the 2008 season, and amassed more wins in his first season than the previous three years combined. The 2009 team won 5 of 12 games, and was eliminated from bowl contention in the next-to-last game of the season. [211] Mike MacIntyre, the defensive coordinator, was named 2009 Assistant Coach of the Year by the American Football Coaches Association (AFCA). [212]
While the football team has struggled at times on the field, the graduation rate of its players is consistently among the highest among Division I FBS schools. Duke's high graduation rates have earned it more AFCA Academic Achievement Awards than any other institution. [213]
In 2012, the football team became bowl-eligible for the first time since the 1994 season. The Blue Devils were invited to play in the Belk Bowl in Charlotte, but lost to Big East Conference co-champion the Cincinnati Bearcats 48–34.
In 2013, the team posted a school record 10 wins including wins over #14 Virginia Tech and #23 Miami. The season culminated in a Coastal Division Championship and a narrow loss to Texas A&M in the Chick-Fil-A Bowl.
For the 2014 season , Duke finished 9–3, 5–3 (ACC) and earned a trip to the Sun Bowl, where the Blue Devils lost to the Pac 12's Arizona State 36–31. In spring 2015, the Detroit Lions drafted Duke offensive guard Laken Tomlinson in the first round of the NFL draft. The Washington Redskins drafted wide receiver Jamison Crowder in the fourth round of the draft. [214]

Track and field
In 2003 Norm Ogilvie was promoted to Director of Track and Field, and has led athletes to over 60 individual ACC championships, and 81 All-America selections, along with most of the track and field records being broken during his tenure. [215] A new facility, the Morris Williams Track and Field Stadium, opened in 2015. [216]

Notable people
Duke's active alumni base of more than 145,000 devote themselves to the university through organizations and events such as the annual Reunion Weekend and Homecoming. [217] There are 75 Duke clubs in the U.S. and 38 such international clubs. [218] For the 2008–09 fiscal year, Duke tied for third in alumni giving rate among U.S. colleges and universities according to U.S. News & World Report . [219] Based on statistics compiled by PayScale in 2011, Duke alumni rank seventh in mid-career median salary among all U.S. colleges and universities.

Jisc
Jisc (formerly the Joint Information Systems Committee ) is a United Kingdom not-for-profit company [2] whose role is to support post-16 and higher education, and research, by providing relevant and useful advice, digital resources and network and technology services, while researching and developing new technologies and ways of working. It is funded by a combination of the UK further and higher education funding bodies, and individual higher education institutions. [3]

Services
Jisc provide services in three core areas:
The UK's academic network, Janet , is provided by Jisc. [4]

History
Jisc was established on 1 April 1993 under the terms of letters of guidance from the Secretaries of State to the newly established Higher Education Funding Councils for England , Scotland and Wales , inviting them to establish a Joint Committee to deal with networking and specialist information services. JISC was to provide national vision and leadership for the benefit of the entire Higher Education sector. The organisation inherited the functions of the Information Systems Committee (ISC) and the Computer Board, which had served universities. An initial challenge was to support a much larger community of institutions, including the ex-polytechnics and higher education colleges .
Four sub-committees initially supporting the JISC committee: their remits covered Networking; Awareness, Liaison and Training; Electronic Information and Technology Applications activities.
In 1995, the Northern Ireland Department of Education became a full partner in JISC. The organisation expanded again in 1999 when the further education funding bodies became funding partners. This expansion prompted a restructuring and a new set of committees:
The expansion also raised wider concerns about JISC's governance, and Professor Sir Brian Follett was appointed to carry out an independent enquiry. His report, published in November 2000, concluded that "JISC is perceived as a UK success story, providing a network of world-class standard and a range of excellent services. Importantly, it evolves continuously and is an excellent example of collaboration between the community and the funding bodies". However, Follett made various recommendations for reform, most of which were accepted by the funding bodies.
A new structure was therefore put in place from December 2001, consisting of a JISC Board, advised by a Steering committee made up of senior officers from each funding body. Six sub-committees fell under two main heads: strategy and policy committees, which aim to ensure that the needs of specific communities are met (in the fields of research, learning and teaching, and management); and functional committees, concentrating on specific areas of work (networking, information environment, and content acquisition).
In January 2005, the Freed [2] om of Information Act came into full effect, giving the public a general right to access all types of recorded information held by public bodies. JISC took an important lead in raising the Act’s profile in the academic community and published its own FOI Publication Scheme.
In the spring of 2005, the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) announced a reduction in its funding contribution to JISC. The LSC and JISC Executive negotiated a package of services that the LSC would continue to contribute towards in the future.
Also in 2005, a number of strategies and policies for UK Higher and Further Education were published, reaffirming the importance of ICT: JISC was seen as taking an important role in supporting and implementing these strategies.
In the same year, JISC signed agreements with several international partners:
Under the Government Spending Review 2004, JISC was awarded additional funding of £81 million for the period April 2006 to March 2009, and was able to launch a range of new programmes to support the work of the higher education and research community. Funding for SuperJANET5 was provided by all JISC's funding partners. Other activities were funded by the Higher Education Funding Councils for England and Wales.
A review of JISC's work, commissioned by the Higher Education Funding Council for England under the chairmanship of Professor Sir Alan Wilson , was published in February 2011. One of the principal findings of the review was that there is no comparable body to JISC within the UK, and internationally its reputation is outstanding as a strategic leader and partner. The Review concluded that, "JISC is an invaluable national resource which has evolved in response to increasing demands over 20 years". However, the Review also recommended that, due to the breadth and complexity of JISC's activity, its structure, processes, projects, programmes and governance need to be simplified and reshaped: "[i]n an era of financial constraint, it is necessary to refocus activities around clearer priorities, and to ensure JISC operates with a sustainable financial model". [5]

Structure
Ronald Urwick Cooke , then recently retired as Vice-Chancellor of the University of York , was appointed Chair of JISC in 2004, and served until 2008. He was succeeded by Timothy O'Shea , Principal and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Edinburgh , who was appointed with effect from 1 January 2009. Martin Hall , Vice-Chancellor of the University of Salford served as Chair until 2015 when he was replaced by David Maguire, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Greenwich . From February 2012 the Chief Executive was Martyn Harrow, who was succeeded by Paul Feldman in October 2015. [1]

Intellectual property

Legal aspects of file sharing
File sharing is the practice of distributing or providing access to digital media , such as computer programs , multimedia (audio, images and video), documents or electronic books . It involves various legal aspects as it is often used to exchange intellectual property that is subject to copyright law or licensing .

File hosting and sharing
File hosting services may be used as a means to distribute or share files without consent of the copyright owner. In such cases one individual uploads a file to a file hosting service, which others may download . Legal history is documented in case law .
For example in the case of Swiss - German file hosting service RapidShare , in 2010 the US government's congressional international anti- piracy caucus declared the site a "notorious illegal site", claiming that the site was "overwhelmingly used for the global exchange of illegal movies, music and other copyrighted works". [1] But in the legal case Atari Europe S.A.S.U. v. Rapidshare AG in Germany (Legal case: OLG Düsseldorf, Judgement of 22 March 2010, Az I-20 U 166/09 dated 22 March 2010) the Düsseldorf higher regional court examined claims related to alleged infringing activity and reached the conclusion on appeal that "most people utilize RapidShare for legal use cases" [2] and that to assume otherwise was equivalent to inviting "a general suspicion against shared hosting services and their users which is not justified". [3] The court also observed that the site removes copyrighted material when asked, does not provide search facilities for illegal material, noted previous cases siding with RapidShare, and after analysis the court concluded that the plaintiff's proposals for more strictly preventing sharing of copyrighted material – submitted as examples of anti-file sharing measures RapidShare might have adopted – were found to be "unreasonable or pointless". [4]
In January 2012 the United States Department of Justice seized and shut down the file hosting site Megaupload.com and commenced criminal cases against its owners and others. Their indictment concluded that Megaupload differed from other online file storage businesses, suggesting a number of design features of its operating model as being evidence showing a criminal intent and venture. [5]

Jurisdictions

Australia
A secondary liability case in Australia, under Australian law, was Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd v Sharman License Holdings Ltd [2005] FCA 1242 (5 September 2005). In that case, the Court determined that the Kazaa file sharing system had "authorized" copyright infringement. The claim for damages was subsequently settled out of court.
In the case of AFACT v iiNet which was fought out in the Federal Court , an internet service provider was found not to be liable for the copyright infringement of its users. The case did not, however, create a clear precedent that Australian ISPs could never be held liable for the copyright infringement of their users by virtue of providing an internet connection. AFACT and other major Australian copyright holders have stated their intention to appeal the case, or pursue the matter by lobbying the government to change the Australian law.

Canada
The legality of file Sharing in Canada is disputed, although in practice, file sharing is tolerated. [ citation needed ] In addition, in the 2004 case of BMG Canada Inc. v. John Doe, the court decided that both downloading music and putting it in a shared folder available to other people online were legal in Canada. It has led to harsh criticism from organizations like International Federation of the Phonographic Industry :

China
The People's Republic of China is known for having one of the most comprehensive and extensive approaches to observing web activity and censoring information in the world. [ citation needed ] Popular social networking sites such as Twitter and Facebook cannot be accessed via direct connection by its citizens. Mainland China requires sites that share video files to have permits and be controlled by the state or owned by state. These permits last for three years and will need renewal after that time period. Web sites that violate any rules will be subject to a 5-year ban from providing videos online. [7] One of the country's most used file sharing programs, BTChina got shut down in December 2009. It was shut down by the State Administration of Radio Film and Television for not obtaining a license to legally distribute media such as audio and video files. [8] Alexa, a company that monitors web traffic, claims that BTChina had 80,000 daily users. Being one of the primary file sharing websites for Chinese citizens, this shutdown affected the lives of many internet users in China. China has an online population of 222.4 million people and 65.8% are said to participate in some form of file-sharing on websites. [9]

European Union
On 5 June 2014, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) ruled that making temporary copies on the user's screen or in the user's cache is not, in itself, illegal. [10] [11] The ruling relates to the British Meltwater case settled on that day. [12]
The judgement of the court states: "Article 5 of Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society must be interpreted as meaning that the copies on the user’s computer screen and the copies in the internet ‘cache’ of that computer’s hard disk, made by an end-user in the course of viewing a website, satisfy the conditions that those copies must be temporary, that they must be transient or incidental in nature and that they must constitute an integral and essential part of a technological process, as well as the conditions laid down in Article 5(5) of that directive, and that they may therefore be made without the authorisation of the copyright holders." [13]
The Boy Genius Report weblog noted that "As long as an Internet user is streaming copyrighted content online ... it’s legal for the user, who isn’t willfully [sic] making a copy of said content. If the user only views it directly through a web browser, streaming it from a website that hosts it, he or she is apparently doing nothing wrong." [14]
In November 2009, the European Parliament voted on changes to the Telecoms Package . With regard to file-sharing, MEPs agreed to compromise between protecting copyright and protecting user's rights. A European Parliament statement reads "A user's internet access may be restricted, if necessary and proportionate, only after a fair and impartial procedure including the user's right to be heard." EU members were given until May 2011 to implement these changes into their own laws. [15]

Germany
In Germany, file sharing is illegal and even one copyrighted file downloaded through BitTorrent can trigger €1000 fines or more. The GEMA also used to block many YouTube videos.

Graduated response
In response to copyright violations using peer to peer file sharing or BitTorrent the content industry has developed what is known as a graduated response , or three strikes system . Consumers who do not adhere to repeated complaints on copyright infringement, risk losing access to the internet. The content industry has thought to gain the co-operation of internet service providers (ISPs), asking them to provide subscriber information for IP addresses identified by the content industry as engaged in copyright violations. Consumer rights groups have argued that this approach denies consumers the right to due process and the right to privacy . The European Parliament passed a non-binding resolution in April 2008 admonishing laws that would require ISPs to disconnect their users and would prevent individuals from acquiring access to broadband. [16] [17]
In a number of European countries attempts to implement a graduated response have led to court cases to establish under which circumstances an ISP may provide subscriber data to the content industry. In order to pursue those that download copyrighted material the individual committing the infringing must be identified. Internet users are often only identifiable by their Internet Protocol address ( IP address ), which distinguishes the virtual location of a particular computer. Most ISPs allocate a pool of IP addresses as needed, rather than assigning each computer a never-changing static IP address. Using ISP subscriber information the content industry has thought to remedy copyright infringement, assuming that the ISPs are legally responsible for the end user activity, and that the end user is responsible for all activity connected to his or hers IP address. [17] [18]
In 2005 a Dutch court ordered ISPs in the Netherlands not to divulge subscriber information because of the way the Dutch content industry group had collected the IP addresses (Foundation v. UPC Nederland). According to Dutch law ISPs can only be ordered to provide personal subscriber data if it is plausible that an unlawful act occurred, and if it is shown beyond a reasonable doubt that the subscriber information will identify the person who committed the infringing act. In Germany court specifically considered the right to privacy and in March 2008 the German Federal Constitutional Court ruled that ISPs could only give out IP address subscription information in case of a "serious criminal investigation". The court furthermore ruled that copyright infringement did not qualify as a serious enough offense. Subsequently, in April 2008, the Bundestag (German parliament) approved a new law requiring ISPs to divulge the identity of suspected infringers who infringe on a commercial scale. Similarly, in Sweden, a controversial file sharing bill is awaiting the Riksdag’s approval. The law, which would enter into effect on 1 April 2009, would allow copyright holders to request the IP addresses and names of copyright infringement suspects in order to take legal action against them. The copyright holders, though, should present sufficient evidence of harm to justify the release of information regarding the Internet subscribers. [19] In Italy, the courts established that criminal liability does not extend to file sharing copyrighted material, as long as it is not done for commercial gain. Ruling on a case involving a copyright holder who employed a third party to collect IP addresses of suspected copyright infringers, the Italian Data Protection Authority ruled in February 2008 that the systematic monitoring peer-to-peer activities for the purpose of detecting copyright infringers and suing them is prohibited. [17]

France
In October 2009, France's highest constitutional court approved the HADOPI law , a "three-strikes law"; [20] however, the law was revoked on 10 July 2013 by the French Government because the punitive penalties imposed on copyright infringers was considered to be disproportionate. [21]

Ireland
In May 2010, Irish internet provider Eircom have announced they will cut off the broadband connection of subscribers suspected of copyright infringement on peer-to-peer file sharing networks. Initially, customers will be telephoned by Eircom to see if they are aware of the unauthorized downloads. When customers are identified for a third time they will lose their internet connection for 7 days, if caught for a fourth time they will lose their internet connection for a year. [22]

Japan
File sharing in Japan is notable for both its size and sophistication. [23] The Recording Industry Association of Japan claims illegal downloads outnumber legal ones 10:1. [24]
The sophistication of Japan's filesharing is due to the sophistication of Japanese anti-filesharing. Unlike most other countries, filesharing copyrighted content is not just a civil offense, but a criminal one, with penalties of up to ten years for uploading and penalties of up to two years for downloading. [24] There is also a high level of Internet service provider cooperation. [25] This makes for a situation where file sharing as practiced in many other countries is quite dangerous.
To counter, Japanese file sharers employ anonymization networks with clients such as Perfect Dark (パーフェクトダーク) and Winny .

Malaysia
In June 2011, the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission has ordered the blocking of several websites including The Pirate Bay and several file-hosting websites via a letter dated 30 May to all Malaysian ISPs for violating Section 41 of the Copyright Act 1987, which deals with pirated content . [26]

Mexico
Recording companies pursued approximately 20,000 lawsuits in 17 countries in 2009 against file-sharing of copyrighted content; however, not a single case was filed within Mexico. Because Mexico’s government has made opening legitimate businesses bureaucratic and costly, consumers have learned to count on a much cheaper means of acquiring music and other media for their entertainment. Consumers continue to share files because the intellectual property laws in Mexico are very weak and have not been updated in order to take into account online trade such as file sharing; therefore, intellectual property laws do not punish file sharing and Mexico’s intellectual property laws cannot affect file sharers because no money is being exchanged. The issue of file sharing is becoming especially problematic for the entertainment industry in the sense that fast broadband connections have become even more common within Mexico, doubling to 61 percent of Web-enabled Mexicans in the last two years. Although file sharing laws are almost non-existent in Mexico, Mexican legislators are considering the approval of the punishment of unauthorized file sharers with fines of up to $20,000 and ten years in jail. However, even if the laws do change in regards to file sharing, finding offenders will not be easy by any means because approximately one-third of Mexico’s Internet users go online at Internet Cafes, where several people may use the same computer every hour. [27] Ultimately, the Internet poses two challenges within Mexico: (1) the sale of counterfeit/copyrighted hard goods and (2) the distribution of illicit new releases, subtitles, covers, and dubbed versions of films, as well as music, software and books. There are many file sharing servers that are hosted within Mexico; however, the majority of these servers are based in the U.S. and Europe but administered in Mexico. According to the recording industry, Internet sharing of music dominates approximately 90% of the total music market in Mexico with Peer to Peer networks as being the most predominant form of music copyright infrigement . [28]

North Africa
Peer to peer file sharing is very common in north Africa [ citation needed ] .

Netherlands
According to Dutch law reproduction of a literary, science, or art work is not considered a violation on the right of the creator or performing artist when all of the following conditions have been met:
-The copy has not been made with an (in)direct commercial motive
-The copy's purpose is exclusively for own practice, study or use
-The number of copies is limited
Such a copy is called a 'thuiskopie' or home copy.
Since 1991, after appointment by the Dutch ministry of Justice exists an organization which guarantees that artists and rightsholders get a compensation for copies of their works that citizens make use of for private use. This compensation is levied indirectly through a surcharge on information carriers, like empty CD's, DVD's, MP3 Players, and from 2013 on, hard disks and tablets.

North Korea
File sharing in North Korea is done by hand with physical transport devices such as computer disk drives , due to lack of access to the Internet. It is illegal, due to regime attempts to control culture. [29] Despite government repression, file sharing is common, as it is in most other countries. [30]
Because official channels are heavily dominated by government propaganda and outside media is banned, illegally traded files are a unique view into the outside world for North Koreans. [30] The most shared media is from South Korea ; k-pop and soap operas . [29]

South Korea
In March 2009, South Korea passed legislation that gave internet users a form of three strikes for unlawful file sharing with the intention of curbing online theft. [31] This is also known as graduated response. As the number of cases of unauthorized sharing increases, the proportion of youth involved has increased. As file shares are monitored, they are sent messages instructing them to stop. If their file sharing continues, their internet connection may be disconnected for up to six months. [32] The force behind this movement is the Korean National Assembly ’s Committee on Culture, Sports, Tourism, Broadcasting & Communications (CCSTB&C). With help from local internet service providers, the CCSTB&C have gained access and formed communication channels to specific file sharing users. [33]

Spain
In a series of cases, Spanish courts have ruled that file sharing for private use is legal. In 2006, the record industry's attempts to criminalize file sharing were thwarted when Judge Paz Aldecoa declared it legal to download indiscriminately in Spain, if done for private use and without any intent to profit, [34] [35] and the head of the police's technology squad has publicly said "No pasa nada. Podéis bajar lo que queráis del eMule. Pero no lo vendáis." ("It's ok. You can download whatever you want with eMule . But don't sell it."). [36] There have been demonstrations where the authorities have been informed that copyrighted material would be downloaded in a public place, the last of which took place on 20 December 2008. [37] No legal action was taken against the protestors. [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] In another decision from May 2009, [43] a judge ruled in favor of a person engaged in the private, non-commercial file-sharing of thousands of movies, even though the copying was done without the consent of the copyright owners.
The Spanish Supreme Court has ruled that personal data associated with an IP address may only be disclosed in the course of a criminal investigation or for public safety reasons. (Productores de Música de España v. Telefónica de España SAU). [17]
It has been reported that Spain has one of the highest rates of file-sharing in Europe. [44] Over a twelve-month period there were 2.4 billion reported downloads of copyrighted works including music, video games, software and films in Spain. Statistics for 2010 indicate that 30% of the Spanish population uses file-sharing websites, double the European average of 15%. [44]
Record labels would have it that this has had a negative impact on the industry, with investment drying up, according to IFPI head John Kennedy. In 2003, for instance, 10 new Spanish artists appeared in the top 50 album chart, but in 2009 not a single new Spanish artist featured in the same chart. Album sales dropped by two-thirds over a period of five years leading up to 2010. "Spain runs the risk of turning into a cultural desert ... I think it's a real shame that people in authority don't see the damage being done." [45]
However, the Spanish Association of Music Promoters (APM) states that "Music is alive," as despite the decrease in record sales the revenues from concert ticket sales has increased 117% over the last decade, from €69.9 million to €151.1 million in 2008. The number of concerts doubled from 71,045 in 2000 to 144,859 in 2008, and the number of people attending concerts increased from 21.8 million in 2000 to over 33 million in 2008. [46]
Despite the troubles weathered by the entertainment industry, file sharing and torrent websites were ruled legal in Spain in March 2010. The judge responsible for the court ruling stated that " P2P networks are mere conduits for the transmission of data between Internet users, and on this basis they do not infringe rights protected by Intellectual Property laws ". [47]
On 20 September 2013, the Spanish government approved new laws that will take effect at the beginning of 2014. The approved legislation will mean that website owners who are earning "direct or indirect profit," such as via advertising links, from pirated content can be imprisoned for up to six years. Peer-to-peer file-sharing platforms and search engines are exempt from the laws. [48]
Since January 2015, Vodafone Spain blocks thepiratebay.org as requested by the Ministry of Interior . And since 29 March 2015 thepiratebay is blocked on multiple URLs from all ISPs [111]

United Kingdom
Around 2010, the UK government's position was that action would help drive the UK’s vital creative and digital sectors to bolster future growth and jobs. [49] According to a 2009 report carried out by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry 95 per cent of music downloads are unauthorised, with no payment to artists and producers . [50] Market research firm Harris Interactive believed there to be 8.3 million file sharers in the UK. Moreover the BPI claimed that in 1999 UK music purchases totaled £1,113 million but had fallen to £893.8 million in 2008. [51] The Digital Economy Act 2010 received Royal Assent on 9 April 2010. [52] But subsequently its main provisions were never legislatively passed.
Previous cases in the UK have seen internet users receive bills of £2500 for sharing music on the internet. [53]
The Digital Economy Bill proposed that internet service providers (ISPs) issue warnings by sending letters to those downloading copyrighted files without authorization. Following this, the bill proposed that ISPs slow down or even suspend internet access for repeat offenders of unauthorized file sharing. The bill aimed to force internet service providers to disclose the identities of those offenders as well as making conditions for the regulation of copyright licensing. The Digital Economy Bill incorporated a graduated response policy despite the alleged file sharer not necessarily having to be convicted of copyright offences. [54] The bill also introduced fines of up to £50,000 for criminal offences relating to copyright infringement – for example if music is downloaded with intent to sell. The high penalty is considered to be proportionate to the harm caused to UK industries . [55] An appeals process exists whereby the accused can contest the case however, the concern has been expressed that this process will be costly and that, in requiring the individual to prove their innocence, the bill reverses the core principles of natural justice . [56] Similarly, a website may be blocked if it is considered that it has been, is being, or is likely to be used in connection with copyright infringement [57] meaning that a site does not actually have to be involved in copyright infringement – rather intent must be proved.
The Act was seen as controversial, and potentially creating serious repercussions for both file sharers and internet service providers. [58] The bill was met with a mixed response. Geoff Taylor of the BPI claims the bill is vital for the future of creative works in the UK. [56] The Conservative party spokesman for Culture and Media stated that those downloading should be given a criminal record. Conversely, the Liberal Democrat party spokesman for Culture and Media claimed the bill was reckless and dangerous stating that children could unwittingly be file sharing causing an entire family to lose their internet connection. In addition to this, there was concern that hackers may access internet connections to download files and leave the bill payer responsible. Specific concerns raised included:
The bill provoked protests in many forms. The Guardian reported that hundreds were expected to march outside the House of Commons on 24 March 2010. [64] Moreover, an estimated 12,000 people sent emails to their MPs, through the citizen advocacy organization 38 degrees. 38 degrees objected to the speed with which the bill was rushed through parliament, without proper debate, due to the imminent dissolution of parliament prior to a general election. [64] In October 2009 TalkTalk launched its Don't Disconnect Us campaign asking people to sign a petition against the proposal to cut off the internet connections of those accused of unauthorized file sharing. [65] By November 2009 the petition had almost 17,000 signatories [66] and by December had reached over 30,000. [67] The Pirate Party in the UK called for non-commercial file sharing to be legalized. Formed in 2009 and intending to enter candidates in the 2010 UK general election, the Pirate Party advocates reform to copyright and patent laws and a reduction in government surveillance. [68]
The Code which would implement these sections of the Act was never passed into law by Parliament, and no action was taken on it after around 2013.
The Digital Economy Act 2017 updates the anti-infringement provisions of existing laws, creates or updates criminal copyright breach provisions, and provides for a wider range of sentencing for criminal infringement.

United States
In Sony Corp. v. Universal Studios, 464 U.S. 417 (1984) , the Supreme Court found that Sony's new product, the Betamax (the first mass-market consumer videocassette recorder ), did not subject Sony to secondary copyright liability because it was capable of substantial non-infringing uses. Decades later, this case became the jumping-off point for all peer-to-peer copyright infringement litigation.
The first peer-to-peer case was A&M Records v. Napster , 239 F.3d 1004 (9th Cir. 2001). Here, the 9th Circuit considered whether Napster was liable as a secondary infringer. First, the court considered whether Napster was contributorily liable for copyright infringement. To be found contributorily liable, Napster must have engaged in "personal conduct that encourages or assists the infringement." [69] The court found that Napster was contributorily liable for the copyright infringement of its end-users because it "knowingly encourages and assists the infringement of plaintiffs' copyrights." [70] The court analyzed whether Napster was vicariously liable for copyright infringement. The standard applied by the court was whether Napster "has the right and ability to supervise the infringing activity and also has a direct financial interest in such activities." [71] The court found that Napster did receive a financial benefit, and had the right and ability to supervise the activity, meaning that the plaintiffs demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of their claim of vicarious infringement. [72] The court denied all of Napster's defenses, including its claim of fair use.
The next major peer-to-peer case was MGM v. Grokster , 545 U.S. 913 (2005). In this case, the Supreme Court found that even if Grokster was capable of substantial non-infringing uses, which the Sony court found was enough to relieve one of secondary copyright liability, Grokster was still secondarily liable because it induced its users to infringe. [73] [74]
It is important to note the concept of blame in cases such as these. In a pure P2P network there is no host, but in practice most P2P networks are a hybrid (see "Computer science perspective" below). This has led groups such as the RIAA to file suit against individual users, rather than against companies. The reason that Napster was subject to violation of the law and ultimately lost in court was because Napster was not a pure P2P network but instead maintained a central server which maintained an index of the files currently available on the network.
Around the world in 2006, an estimated five billion songs, equating to approximately 38,000 years in music were swapped on peer-to-peer websites, while 509 million songs were purchased online. The same study which estimated these findings also found that artists that had an online presence ended up retaining more of the profits rather than the music companies. [75]
In November 2009, the U.S. House of Representatives introduced the Secure Federal File Sharing Act , [76] which would, if enacted, prohibit the use of peer-to-peer file-sharing software by U.S. government employees and contractors on computers used for federal government work. [77] The bill has died with the adjournment of 111th Congress.

Copyright law
A copyright in the United States consists of the exclusive rights enumerated under 17 USC 106. [78] When having to do with pictures, music, literature or video, these exclusive rights include: 1. The right to reproduce or redistribute the picture, music, lyrics, text, video, or images of a video. 2. The right to distribute the picture, music, lyrics, text, video, or images of a video. 3. The right to produce derivative works of the copyrighted work. 4. The right to perform the work publicly. 5. The right to display the work publicly. 6. The right to transmit the work through the use of radio or digital transition. In summary, these exclusive rights cover the reproduction, adaptation, publication, performance, and display of a copyrighted work (subject to limitations such as fair use ). [79]
Anyone who violates the exclusive rights of copyright has committed copyright infringement , whether or not the work has been registered at the copyright office. If an infringement has occurred, the copyright owner has a legal right to sue the infringer for violating the terms of their copyright. The monetary value of the lawsuit can be whatever a jury decides is acceptable.
In the case of file sharing networks, companies claim that peer-to-peer file sharing enables the violation of their copyrights. File sharing allows any file to be reproduced and redistributed indefinitely. Therefore, the reasoning is that if a copyrighted work is on a file sharing network, whoever uploaded or downloaded the file is liable for violating the copyright because they are reproducing the work without the authorization of the copyright holder or the law.

Primary infringement liability
The fundamental question, "what use can a P2P file-sharing network's customers make of the software and of copyrighted materials without violating copyright law", has no answer at this time, as there has been almost no dispositive decision-making on the subject.
This issue has received virtually no appellate attention, the sole exception being BMG Music v. Gonzalez , [80] a decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, which held that where a defendant has admitted downloading and copying song files from other users in the P2P network without permission of the copyright holders, she cannot claim that such copying is a "fair use". Since Gonzalez involves a defendant who had admitted to actual copying and downloading of songs from other unauthorized users, it is of limited applicability in contested cases, in that it relates solely to the reproduction right in 17 USC 106(1), and has no bearing on the 17 USC 106(3) distribution right.
A series of cases dealing with the RIAA's "making available" theory has broad implications, not only for the subject of P2P file sharing but for the Internet at large. The first to receive a great deal of attention was Elektra v. Barker , [81] an RIAA case against Tenise Barker, a Bronx nursing student. Ms. Barker moved to dismiss the complaint, contending, among other things, that the RIAA's allegation of "making available" did not state any known claim under the Copyright Act. [82] [83] The RIAA countered with the argument that even without any copying, and without any other violation of the record companies' distribution rights, the mere act of "making available" is a copyright infringement, even though the language does not appear in the Copyright Act, as a violation of the "distribution" right described in 17 USC 106(3). [84] Thereafter, several amicus curiae were permitted to file briefs in the case, including the MPAA, which agreed [85] with the RIAA's argument, and the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), the U.S. Internet Industry Association (USIIA), and the Computer & Communications Industry Association (CCIA), which agreed with Ms. Barker. [86] [87] The US Department of Justice submitted a brief refuting one of the arguments made by EFF, [88] but did not take any position on the RIAA's "making available" argument, noting that it had never prosecuted anyone for "making available". [89] The Elektra v. Barker case was argued before Judge Kenneth M. Karas in Manhattan federal court on 26 January 2007, [90] and decided on 31 March 2008. [91]
The decision rejected the RIAA's "making available" theory but sustained the legal sufficiency of the RIAA's pleading of actual distribution and actual downloading. Additionally, the Court suggested to the RIAA that it might want to amend its complaint to include a claim for "offering to distribute for purposes of distribution", but gave no guidance on what type of evidence would be required for an "offer". The Court's suggestion that merely "offering" to distribute could constitute a violation of the Act has come under attack from William Patry, the author of the treatise Patry on Copyright. [92]
Three other decisions, also rejecting the RIAA's "making available" theory, came from more unexpected sources.
The Barker decision was perhaps rendered anticlimactic by the decision of Judge Janet Bond Arterton, from the District of Connecticut, handed down six weeks earlier, in Atlantic v. Brennan , [93] rejecting the RIAA's application for a default judgment. Brennan , like Barker , rejected the RIAA's "making available" theory, but unlike Barker it found the RIAA's specificity on the other issues to be insufficient, and it rejected the conceptual underpinnings upon which Judge Karas based his "offer to distribute" idea.
And Barker was perhaps overshadowed by the decision of Judge Gertner, rendered the same day as the Barker decision, in quashing a subpoena served on Boston University to learn the identity of BU students, in London-Sire v. Doe 1 . [94] Here too the Court rejected the RIAA's "making available" theory, but here too—like Atlantic but unlike Elektra – also rejected any possible underpinning for an "offer to distribute" theory.
And then came the decision of the District Judge Neil V. Wake, in the District of Arizona, in Atlantic v. Howell . [95] This 17-page decision [96] – rendered in a case in which the defendant appeared pro se (i.e., without a lawyer) but eventually received the assistance of an amicus curiae brief and oral argument by the Electronic Frontier Foundation [97] —was devoted almost exclusively to the RIAA's "making available" theory and to the "offer to distribute" theory suggested by Judge Karas in Barker . Atlantic v. Howell strongly rejected both theories as being contrary to the plain wording of the Copyright Act. The Court held that "Merely making a copy available does not constitute distribution....The statute provides copyright holders with the exclusive right to distribute "copies" of their works to the public "by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or lending." 17 U.S.C. ...106(3). Unless a copy of the work changes hands in one of the designated ways, a "distribution" under ...106(3) has not taken place." The Court also expressly rejected the 'offer to distribute' theory suggested in Barker , holding that "An offer to distribute does not constitute distribution". [98]
The next critical decision was that in Capitol v. Thomas , which had received a great deal of media attention because it was the RIAA's first case to go to trial, and probably additional attention due to its outsized initial jury verdict. The RIAA had prevailed upon the trial judge to give the jurors an instruction which adopted its "making available" theory, [99] over the protestations of the defendant's lawyer. Operating under that instruction, the jury returned a $222,000 verdict over $23.76 worth of song files. [100] Almost a year after the jury returned that verdict, however, District Judge Michael J. Davis set the verdict aside, and ordered a new trial, on the ground that his instruction to the jurors—that they did not need to find that any files were actually distributed in order to find a violation of plaintiffs' distribution right—was a "manifest error of law". [101] The Judge's 44-page decision agreed with Howell and London-Sire and rejected so much of Barker as intimated the existence of a viable "offer to distribute" theory.
There may be indications that the RIAA has been jettisoning its "making available" theory. In a San Diego, California, case, Interscope v. Rodriguez , where the Judge dismissed the RIAA's complaint as "conclusory", "boilerplate", "speculation", the RIAA filed an amended complaint which contained no reference at all to "making available". [102] In subsequent cases, the RIAA's complaint abandoned altogether the "making available" theory, following the model of the Interscope v. Rodriguez amended complaint.
In its place, it is apparently adopting the "offer to distribute" theory suggested by Judge Karas. In the amended complaint the RIAA filed in Barker , it deleted the "making available" argument—as required by the judge—but added an "offer to distribute" claim, as the judge had suggested. [103] It remains to be seen if it will follow that pattern in other cases.

Secondary infringement liability
Secondary liability, the possible liability of a defendant who is not a copyright infringer but who may have encouraged or induced copyright infringement by another, has been discussed generally by the United States Supreme Court in MGM v. Grokster , [74] which held in essence that secondary liability could only be found where there has been affirmative encouragement or inducing behavior. On remand, the lower court found Streamcast, the maker of Morpheus software, to be liable for its customers' copyright infringements, based upon the specific facts of that case. [104]
Under US law "the Betamax decision" ( Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc. ), holds that copying "technologies" are not inherently illegal, if substantial non-infringing use can be made of them. Although this decision predated the widespread use of the Internet, in MGM v. Grokster , the U.S. Supreme Court acknowledged the applicability of the Betamax case to peer-to-peer file sharing, and held that the networks could not be liable for merely providing the technology, absent proof that they had engaged in "inducement."
In 2006 the RIAA initiated its first major post-Grokster, secondary liability case, against LimeWire in Arista Records LLC v. Lime Group LLC , where the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York held that LimeWire induced copyright infringement and granted a permanent injunction against LimeWire .

Electronic Frontier Foundation
The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) seeks to protect and expand digital rights through litigation , political lobbying , and public awareness campaigns. The EFF has vocally opposed the RIAA in its pursuit of lawsuits against users of file sharing applications and supported defendants in these cases. The foundation promotes the legalization of peer-to-peer sharing of copyrighted materials and alternative methods to provide compensation to copyright holders. [105]
In September 2008 the organization marked the 5th 'anniversary' of the RIAA's litigation campaign by publishing a highly critical, detailed report, entitled "RIAA v. The People: Five Years Later", [106] concluding that the campaign was a failure.

Reported suspension of RIAA litigation campaign
Several months later, it was reported that the RIAA was suspending its litigation campaign, [107] followed by a report that it had fired the investigative firm SafeNet (formerly MediaSentry) operating on its behalf. [108] Some of the details of the reports, including claims that the RIAA had actually stopped commencing new lawsuits months earlier, and that its reason for doing so was that it had entered into tentative agreements with Internet service providers to police their customers, proved to be either inaccurate or impossible to verify [109] and RIAA's claim not to have filed new cases "for months" was false. [110]

Notable cases

Orphan works
An orphan work is a copyright protected work for which rightsholders are positively indeterminate or uncontactable. Sometimes the names of the originators or rightsholders are known, yet it is impossible to contact them because additional details cannot be found. [1] A work can become orphaned through rightsholders being unaware of their holding , or by their demise (e.g. deceased persons or defunct companies) and establishing inheritance has proved impracticable. [2] In other cases, comprehensively diligent research fails to determine any authors, creators or originators for a work.

Extent
Precise figures of orphan works are not readily available, even though libraries, archives and museums hold a vast number of them. In April 2009, a study estimated that the collections of public sector organisations in the UK hold about 25 million orphan works. [2] Examples of orphan works include photographs that do not note the photographer, such as photos from scientific expeditions and historical images, old folk music recordings, little known novels and other literature. [1] Software which became an orphaned work is usually known as abandonware . The Computerspielemuseum Berlin estimates that around 50 % of their video game collection consists of at least partial orphans. [3] Source code escrow can prevent software orphaning but is seldom applied.

Impact
In countries whose laws do not specifically allow for the use of orphan works, orphan works are not available for legal use by filmmakers, archivists, writers, musicians, and broadcasters. Because rightsholders cannot be identified and located in order to obtain permission, historical and cultural records such as period film footage, photographs, and sound recordings cannot be legally incorporated in contemporary works in such countries (unless the incorporation qualifies as fair use ). [4] Public libraries , educational institutions and museums , who digitise old manuscripts, books, sound recordings and film, may choose to not digitise orphan works, or make orphan works available to the public, [4] for fear that a re-appearing rightsholder may sue them for damages. [1]

Causes
According to Neil Netanel the increase in orphan works is the result of two factors: (1) that copyright terms have been lengthened, and (2) that copyright is automatically conferred without registration or renewal. [4] Currently only a fraction of old copyrighted works is available to the public. Netanel argues that rightsholders have "no incentive to maintain a work in circulation" or otherwise make their out-of-print content available unless they can hope to earn more money doing so than by producing new works or engaging in more lucrative activities. [4]

Specifics by country

Canada
Canada has created a supplemental licensing scheme, under Section 77 of its Copyright Act, that allows licenses for the use of published works to be issued by the Copyright Board of Canada on behalf of unlocatable rightsholders, after a prospective licensor has made "reasonable efforts to locate [holders of] copyright". [5] As of August 2008, the Board had issued 226 such licenses, [6] and denied 7 applications. [7]

European Union
The European Commission , the civil branch of the European Union , created a report on Digital Preservation of Orphan Works and Out-of-Print Works in 2007. [8] In 1998 with the passing of the Fairness in Music Licensing Act in the United States the European Commission brought an arbitration against the United States in the World Trade Organization for violation of the Berne Convention . The WTO sided with the EC in 2000, [9] and the US and EC announced a temporary settlement arrangement on June 23, 2003, with the Fairness in Music Licensing Act remaining in effect [10] and the US paying to a fund established in the EU for the benefit of rights-holders. [11] As of May 7, 2010, the US continues to file required status reports, with the WTO stating that they still working on a resolution with all parties. [12]
On June 4, 2008 European representatives of museums, libraries, archives, audiovisual archives and rightsholders signed a Memorandum of Understanding , [13] an orphan works legislation supported by rightsholders. It will help cultural institutions to digitize books, films and music whose authors are unknown, making them available to the public online. [8] In 2009 the Strategic Content Alliance and the Collections Trust published a report [2] on the scope and impact of orphan works and their effect on the delivery of web services to the public.
In October 2012 the European Union adopted Directive 2012/28/EU on Orphan Works. [14] The directive applies to orphan works that were created in the EU as printed works (books, journals, magazines and newspapers), cinematographic and audio-visual works, phonograms and works embedded or incorporated in other works or phonograms (e.g. pictures in a book). Under certain conditions, the directive can also apply to unpublished works (such as letters or manuscripts). [15] Whether orphaned software and video games (" Abandonware ") fall under the audiovisual works definition is a matter debated by scholars. [16]

United Kingdom
On the 29th October 2014 the Intellectual Property Office launched an online licensing scheme for orphan works. [17] [18]

United States

Other nations
Hungary , [19] India , [20] Japan , [21] Saudi Arabia , [22] and South Korea [23] have established state licensing options for orphan works.

Patent troll
Patent troll is a categorical or pejorative term applied to person or company that attempts to enforce patent rights against accused infringers far beyond the patent's actual value or contribution to the prior art , [1] often through hardball legal tactics ( frivolous litigation , vexatious litigation , SLAPP , chilling effects , and the like). Patent trolls often do not manufacture products or supply services based upon the patents in question. However, some entities which do not practice their asserted patent may not be considered "patent trolls" when they license their patented technologies on reasonable terms in advance.
Other related terms include patent holding company ( PHC ), patent assertion entity ( PAE ), and non-practicing entity ( NPE ), which may or may not be considered a "patent troll" depending on the position they are taking and the perception of that position by the public. While in most cases the entities termed "trolls" are operating within the bounds of the legal system, their aggressive tactics achieve outcomes contrary to the origins of the patent system as a legislated social contract to foster and protect innovation (in the absence of such legislation, exclusivity of ideas is generally not a natural property right); the extremely rapid rise of the modern information economy has put the global intellectual property system under strain.

Patent trolling has been less of a problem in Europe than in the U.S. because Europe has a loser pays costs regime . [2] In contrast, the U.S. generally used the so-called American rule , providing that each party is responsible for paying its own attorney's fees, until the U.S. Supreme Court decided Octane Fitness, LLC v. ICON Health & Fitness, Inc. on April 29, 2014.
In 2015, 45% of all patent cases were filed in the Eastern District of Texas in Marshall , as this Court was known for favoring plaintiffs and for its expertise in patent suits. [3] However, in May 2017 the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in an unanimous decision in TC Heartland LLC v. Kraft Foods Group Brands LLC that patent litigation cases must be heard in the state which the defendant is incorporated, shutting down this option for plaintiffs. [4]

Etymology and definition
The term "patent troll " was used at least once in 1993 with a slightly different meaning, to describe countries that file aggressive patent lawsuits. [5] The 1994 educational video, The Patents Video also used the term, depicting a green troll guarding a bridge and demanding fees. [6] [7] The origin of the term patent troll has also been variously attributed to Anne Gundelfinger, or Peter Detkin, both counsel for Intel , during the late 1990s. [8] [9]
Patent troll is currently a controversial term, susceptible to numerous definitions, none of which are considered satisfactory from the perspective of understanding how patent trolls should be treated in law. [10] Definitions include a party that does one or more of the following:
The term "patent pirate" has been used to describe both patent trolling and acts of patent infringement. [16] Related expressions are "non-practising entity" (NPE) [17] (defined as "a patent owner who does not manufacture or use the patented invention, but rather than abandoning the right to exclude, an NPE seeks to enforce its right through the negotiation of licenses and litigation"), [17] "patent assertion entity" (PAE), [18] "non-manufacturing patentee", [19] "patent shark", [20] "patent marketer", [19] [21] "patent assertion company", [22] and "patent dealer". [23]
Confusion over use of the term patent troll is clear in research and media reporting. In 2014, Price Waterhouse Coopers published research into patent litigation including a study of non-practicing entities including individual inventors and non-profit organisations such as universities. [24] In quoting that research, media outlets such as the Washington Post labelled all non-practicing entities as patent trolls. [25]

Legal and regulatory history
According to RPX Corporation , a firm that helps reduce company patent-litigation risk by offering licenses to patents it owns in exchange for an agreement not to sue, [26] patent trolls in 2012 filed more than 2,900 infringement lawsuits nationwide (nearly six times higher than the number in 2006). [27]
In addressing the America Invents Act (AIA) passed by Congress in September 2011 reforming US patent law, U.S. President Barack Obama said in February 2013 that US "efforts at patent reform only went about halfway to where we need to go." The next indicated step was to pull together stakeholders and find consensus on "smarter patent laws." [28]
On June 4, 2013, President Obama referenced patent trolls and directed the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to take five new actions to help stem the surge in patent-infringement lawsuits tying up the court system. Saying "they don't actually produce anything themselves, they're just trying to essentially leverage and hijack somebody else's idea and see if they can extort some money out of them," the President ordered the USPTO to require companies to be more specific about exactly what their patent covers and how it is being infringed. [29]
The Administration further stated the USPTO will tighten scrutiny of patent claims that appear overly broad, and will aim to curb patent-infringement lawsuits against consumers and small-business owners using off-the-shelf technology. The President asked Congress to enact legislation to more aggressively curb "abusive" lawsuits. [30] [31] David Kravets said "[t]he history ebooks will remember the 44th president for setting off a chain of reforms that made predatory patent lawsuits a virtual memory." [32]
In the U.S. Congress , Senator Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) sponsored legislation in 2013 intended to reduce the incidence of patent trolling. The bill, called the Patent Litigation Integrity Act, would help judges make patent trolls pay for the cost of the lawsuits, especially if the trolls lost the lawsuits. [33]
In February 2014, Apple filed two friend-of-the-court briefs for cases pending in the U.S. Supreme Court, claiming to be the #1 target for patent trolls, having faced nearly 100 lawsuits in the preceding three years. [34]
In November 2014, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) settled its first consumer-protection lawsuit against a company, for using “deceptive sales claims and phony legal threats”. [35] The FTC found that defendant MPHJ had sent letters to more than 16,000 small to mid-size businesses threatening patent infringement lawsuits if the companies did not comply with its demand for licensing fees of $1,000 to $1,200 per employee, but never making preparations for such lawsuits. [35] The 2014 settlement provided for a $16,000 fine per letter that MPHJ or its attorneys would send. [36]

State responses in the United States
In May 2013, Vermont's Consumer Protection Act took effect. The Vermont law prohibits bad faith infringement threats, with bad faith indicated by: lack of specificity of the alleged infringement, settlement demands or damage claims that include excessive licensing fees, and unreasonably short deadlines for payment of demanded monies. [37] Vermont's statute gives recipients of threat letters the right to counter-sue in state court, thus making it a less lucrative business model to send out large numbers of threat letters. [37] As of August 2013, the Vermont legislation had not been tested in court as to violation of federal preemption , the legal principle that bars states from interfering in matters regulated or administrated by the federal government (such as aviation), or enforcement of federal law. [37]
In August 2013, Nebraska's Attorney General sent warnings to a patent troll's law firm, asserting that to send frivolous licensing demands to Nebraska businesses may constitute unfair and deceptive business practices and violate Nebraska’s unfair competition law. [38]
In 2013, Minnesota's Attorney General obtained a settlement prohibiting MPHJ Technology Investments LLC from continuing its licensing campaign, Minnesota said to be the first state to obtain such a settlement. [39]
In April 2014, the Wisconsin passed legislation that would make patent trolling Wisconsin companies more difficult. The legislation imposes strict notification duties on the entity claiming infringement, and there are potentially strict penalties for non-compliance with the notification process. [40]
In the 2014, legislative session, Idaho Lieutenant Governor Brad Little sponsored Senate Bill 1354, or the “Patent-troll” bill which protected companies from “bad faith assertions of patent infringement,” in which a patent holder frequently harasses businesses for purportedly infringing on a patent in order to collect an extortionate licensing fee. [41] [42]

Causes
The cost of defending against a patent infringement suit, as of 2004, is typically $1 million or more before trial, and $2.5 million for a complete defense, even if successful. [43] Because the costs and risks are high, defendants may settle even non-meritorious suits they consider frivolous for several hundred thousand dollars. [43] The uncertainty and unpredictability of the outcome of jury trials in the United States also encourages settlement. [44]
It has also been suggested that distortions in the patent market, such as those caused by the examination backlog , promote patent trolling. [45]
If the patent office accepts claims that have been invented, published or even patented before, ignoring material prior art , then even existing technologies in use are subject to patent trolling. Reexamination to invalidate the patent based on prior art can be requested, but requests are typically made only after a lawsuit is filed or threatened (about 0.33% of patents in U.S. have reexam requested but this number also reflects the low percentage of issued patents for which re-examination is requested.) [46] and often in conjunction with an infringement lawsuit. [47] Only the patent holder will participate in this process, and the party requesting the reexamination has no right of appeal and is estopped from using the same evidence in any subsequent civil action; this risk keeps the popularity of reexamination low despite its lower cost. [48] [ self-published source? ] Furthermore, the most common outcome is not the validation or invalidation of the patent, but narrowing the scope of the claims. [47]
There is also no obligation to defend an unused patent immediately, thus manufacturing companies may produce the patented product for years until the patent troll sues them. For example, the JPEG format, intended to be free of license fees, was subject to two patent attacks , one by Forgent Networks during 2002–2006 and another by Global Patent Holdings during 2007–2009. Both patents were eventually invalidated based on prior art, [49] [50] but before this, Forgent collected more than $100 million in license fees from 30 companies and sued 31 other companies [51] (see JPEG#Patent issues and references therein).

Effects
In 2011, United States business entities incurred $29 billion in direct costs because of patent trolls. [52] Lawsuits brought by "patent assertion companies" made up 61% of all patent cases in 2012, according to the Santa Clara University School of Law. [53] From 2009 through mid-2013, Apple Inc. was the defendant in 171 lawsuits brought by non-practicing entities (NPEs), followed by Hewlett-Packard (137), Samsung (133), AT&T(127), and Dell (122). [54] Patent troll-instigated litigation, once mostly confined to large companies in patent-dependent industries such as pharmaceuticals, came to involve companies of all sizes in a wide variety of industries. [37] In 2005, patent trolls sued 800 small firms (those with less than $100 million annual revenue), the number growing to nearly 2,900 such firms in 2011; the median defendant's annual revenue was $10.3 million. [55] A July 2014 PricewaterhouseCoopers study concluded that non-practicing entities (NPEs) accounted for 67 percent of all patent lawsuits filed—up from 28 percent five years earlier—and though the median monetary award size has shrunk over time, the median number of awards to NPEs was three times higher than those of practicing companies. [56]
A 2014 study from Harvard University, Harvard Business School and the University of Texas concluded that firms forced to pay patent trolls reduce R&D spending, averaging $211 million less than firms having won a lawsuit against a troll. [57] That 2014 study also found that trolls tend to sue firms with fewer attorneys on staff, in effect encouraging firms to invest in legal representation at the expense of technology development. [57] The 2014 study reported that trolls tend to opportunistically sue firms with more available cash, even if the firm's available cash was not earned in the technology that is the subject of the patent lawsuit, and targeting the firms long before a product begins turning a profit, thus disincentivizing investment in new technologies. [57]
Emphasis became progressively focused on patents covering software rather than chemical or mechanical inventions, given the difficulty in defining the scope of software patent claims in comparison to the more easily defined specific compounds in chemical patents. [58] A GAO study concluded that the proportion of patent lawsuits initiated by trolls hadn’t changed significantly from 2007 through 2011, the GAO speculating that the raw numerical increase in both troll and non-troll instituted lawsuits may be due to the "inherently imprecise" language and a lack of common, standardized, scientific vocabulary in constantly evolving emerging technologies such as software. [59] Software patents were described as "particularly prone" to abuse because software is "inherently conceptual," with research indicating that a software patent is four times as likely as a chemical patent to be involved in litigation, and a software "business method patent" is thirteen times more likely to be litigated. [60]
On June 4, 2013, the National Economic Council and Council of Economic Advisers released a report entitled Patent Assertion and U.S. Innovation [61] that found significant harm to the economy from such entities and made recommendations to address them. The report further stated: "Specific policies should focus on fostering clearer patents with a high standard of novelty and non-obviousness, reducing disparity in the costs of litigation for patent owners and technology users, and increasing the adaptability of the innovation system to challenges posed by new technologies and new business models, would likely have a similar effect today." [28]
A core criticism of patent trolls is that "they are in a position to negotiate licensing fees that are grossly out of alignment with their contribution to the alleged infringer's product or service", [62] notwithstanding their non-practising status or the possible weakness of their patent claims. The risk of paying high prices for after-the-fact licensing of patents they were not aware of, and the costs for extra vigilance for competing patents that might have been issued, in turn increases the costs and risks of manufacturing.
On the other hand, the ability to buy, sell and license patents is seen by some as generally productive. The Wall Street Journal argued that by creating a secondary market for patents, these activities make the ownership of patents more liquid, thereby creating incentives to innovate and patent. [23] [63] Patent Licensing Entities also argue that aggregating patents in the hands of specialized licensing companies facilitates access to technology by more efficiently organizing ownership of patent rights. [64] [65]
In an interview conducted in 2011, former U.S. federal judge Paul R. Michel regarded "the 'problem' [of non-practicing entities, the so-called "patent trolls"] to be greatly exaggerated." Although there are a number of problems with the U.S. patent system, i.e. "most NPE infringement suits are frivolous because the defendant plainly does not infringe or the patent is invalid", "patent infringement suits are very slow and expensive", and venue abuses, "[...] NPEs may add value to the patents by buying them up when manufacturers decline to do so. Inventors may have benefited from the developing market in patent acquisition." [66]
This view was supported in an article in 2014 that suggests that the pejorative term 'Patent Trolls' works for the benefit of large organisations who infringe patents and resent smaller inventors being represented by someone with the clout to take them on. The argument against the use of the term is that NPEs, in the main, return the majority of a settlement to the original inventor. [67] Similarly, New York Times columnist Joe Nocera wrote that legislation on patent reforms considered by the United States Congress that are "allegedly aimed at trolls" often instead "effectively tilt the playing field even further towards big companies with large lobby budget". [68]

Mechanics
Patent trolls operate much like any other company that is protecting and aggressively exploiting a patent portfolio . However, their focus is on obtaining additional money from existing uses, not from seeking out new applications for the technology. They monitor the market for possibly infringing technologies by watching popular products, news coverage and analysis. They also review published patent applications for signs that another company is developing infringing technology, possibly unaware of their own patents. They then develop a plan for how to proceed. They may start by suing a particularly vulnerable company that has much to lose, or little money to defend itself, hoping that an early victory or settlement will establish a precedent to encourage other peer companies to acquiesce to licenses. Alternately they may attack an entire industry at once, hoping to overwhelm it.
An individual case often begins with a perfunctory infringement complaint , [43] or even a mere threat of suit, which is often enough to encourage settlement for the nuisance or "threat value" of the suit by purchasing a license to the patent. In the United States, patent suits previously could be filed any United States District Court , allowing plaintiffs to "shop around" to find the court with the highest chances of success; in 2015, 45% of all patent cases were filed in the Eastern District of Texas in Marshall , as this Court was known for favoring plaintiffs and for its expertise in patent suits. [3] However, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in an unanimous May 2017 decision in TC Heartland LLC v. Kraft Foods Group Brands LLC that patent litigation cases must be heard in the state which the defendant is incorporated, shutting down this option for plaintiffs. [4]
The uncertainty and unpredictability of the outcome of jury trials also encourages settlement. [44] If it wins, the plaintiff is entitled as damages an award of at least a "reasonable" royalty determined according to the norms of the field of the patented invention. [69]
Patent trolls are at a disadvantage in at least two ways. First, patent owners who make and sell their invention are entitled to awards of lost profits. However, patent trolls, being non-manufacturers, typically do not qualify. [ citation needed ] Further, patent owners' rights to bar infringers from manufacture, use, or sale of technologies that infringe their patents has recently been curtailed in the 2006 court decision eBay v. MercExchange . Rather than automatically granting an injunction, the US Supreme Court stated that Courts must apply a standard reasonableness test to determine if an injunction is warranted. Writing in Forbes about the impact of this case on patent trolls, writer Jessica Holzer concludes: "The high court's decision deals a blow to patent trolls, which are notorious for using the threat of permanent injunction to extort hefty fees in licensing negotiations as well as huge settlements from companies they have accused of infringing. Often, those settlements can be far greater than the value of the infringing technology: Recall the $612.5 million that Canada's Research in Motion forked over to patent-holding company NTP, Inc. , to avoid the shutting down of its popular BlackBerry service." [70]
The non-manufacturing status of a patent troll has a strategic advantage, in that the target infringer cannot counter-sue for infringement. In litigation between businesses who make, use or sell patented technology, the defendant will often use its own patent portfolio as a basis to file a counterclaim for infringement. The counterclaim becomes an incentive for settlement, and in many industries, discourages patent infringement suits. Additionally, a patent suit carries with it the threat of an injunction or mutual injunction, which could shut down manufacturing or other business operations. [71] If a patent owner does not make, use or sell technology, then the possibility of a counter-suit for infringement would not exist. For this reason, a patent troll is able to enforce patents against large companies which have substantial patent portfolios of their own. Furthermore, patent trolls may use shell companies . [72]

Facing patent trolls
Patent trolls are neither using nor marketing the inventions covered by their patents, but instead plan to make money by threatening or filing lawsuits. [73] Using the justice system to make money gives patent trolls a financial advantage because patent troll plaintiffs are typically immune from defense strategies large business employ against legitimate smaller patent plaintiffs (e.g., litigation costs are significantly higher for the defendant/infringer than for a purported damaged plaintiff who has a "no recovery, no fee" contingency-fee lawyer; trolls have an almost-unrestricted ability to choose plaintiff-friendly forums , frequently the Eastern District of Texas). [43]
Strategies used by companies to protect themselves from legitimate competition are ineffective against patent trolls. Defensive techniques include: monitoring patent activities of competitors to avoid infringing patents (since patent trolls are not competitors, productive companies usually have no way to find out about the troll or its patents until after significant investments have been made to produce and market a product); going on the offensive with counterclaims that accuse the patent plaintiff of infringing patents owned by the defendant (the mutual threat often leads the parties to arrive at a mutually beneficial cross-licensing arrangement); or a "scorched earth" defense designed to drive up litigation costs (which is equally ineffective because patent trolls plan for and have the finances to fully litigate a case; [43] in fact, some are able to draw on hedge funds and institutional investors to finance their patent cases). [74] Patent "pooling" arrangements where many companies collaborate to bring their patented knowledge together to create new products are also inapplicable to patent trolls because they do not produce products. It is possible to perform offensive techniques to ward off patent trolls with the open source release of concepts preemptively to prevent patent trolls from establishing intellectual property on building block technology. [75] A Google -led initiative, LOT Network , was formed in 2014 to combat PAEs by cross-licensing patents that fall into the hands of enforcers. [76] Another Google-affiliated organization, Unified Patents , seeks to reduce the number and effectiveness of patent trolls by filing inter partes reviews on patents owned by trolls. [77]
Large companies who use patent litigation as a competitive tool risk losing their patent rights if a defendant claims patent misuse . However, the misuse defense is difficult against a patent troll because antitrust violations typically involved require significant market power on the part of the patent holder. [78] Nevertheless, manufacturers do use various tactics to limit their exposure to patent trolls. Most have broader uses as well for defending their technologies against competitors. These include:

Commercial use of copyleft works
Commercial advantage of copyleft works differs from traditional commercial advantage of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) . The economic focus tends to be on monetizing other scarcities, complimentary goods rather than the free content itself. One way to make money with copylefted works is to sell consultancy and support for users of a copylefted work. [1] Generally, financial profit is expected to be much lower in a "copyleft" business than in a business using proprietary works. [2] Another way is to use the copylefted work as a commodity tool or component to provide a service or product. Android phones, for example, are based on the Linux kernel . Firms with proprietary products can make money by exclusive sales, by single and transferable ownership, and litigation rights over the work.

Internal use
Businesses and governments can obtain value and cut costs by using copyleft software internally. See for example Linux adoption .

Development
By building on existing free software, businesses can reduce their development costs. With software that is copyleft, the business will then have the disadvantage that selling licences is rarely possible (because anyone can distribute copies at no cost), but the business will have the advantage that their competitors can't incorporate that improved version into a product and then distribute it without that competitor also making their modifications available to the original distributor, thereby avoiding a type of free rider problem .
Copyleft enables volunteer programmers and organizations to feel involved and contribute to software and feel confident any future derivatives will remain accessible to them, and that their contributions are part of a larger goal, like developing the kernel of an operating system (OS). Copylefting software makes clear the intent of never abusing or hiding any knowledge that is contributed. Copyleft also ensures that all contributing programmers and companies cannot fork proprietary versions to create an advantage over another.
The argument for investments in research and development for copyleft businesses may seem weak, by not having exclusivity over the profits gained from the result. Economically, copyleft is considered the only mechanism able to compete with monopolistic firms that rely on financial exploitation of copyright, trademark and patent laws.

Distribution
Commercial distributors of Linux -based systems (like Red Hat and Mandriva ) might have had some ups and downs in finding a successful construction (or business model ) for setting up such businesses, but in time it was shown to be possible to base a business on a commercial service surrounding a copylefted creation. One well-known example is Mandrake, which was one of the first companies to succeed on the stock market after the implosion of large parts of the IT market in the early 21st century. They also had success in convincing government bodies to switch to their flavor of Linux .
However, excluding some notable exceptions like the Debian Project (which is expressly noncommercial and committed to free software on principle), most Linux distributors don't actively seek to limit their usage of proprietary software or restrict the proliferation of non-free licenses in connection with their distributions . There appears to be no real reason why an exploitation of commercial services surrounding copylefted creations would not be possible in small-scale business, which as a business concept is no more complex than making money with a "public domain" recipe for brewing coffee—successfully exploited by so many cafeteria owners. However, there are few examples so far of SMEs having risked such a leap for their core business . UserLinux , a project set up by Bruce Perens , supports the emergence of such small-scale business based on free software , that is, copylefted or otherwise freely licensed computer programs. The UserLinux website showcased some case studies and success stories of such businesses. [3]

Art
In art, making commercial services out of a copylefted creation is more difficult to do in practice than in software development. Public performances could be considered as one of a few possibilities of providing such "services".
The music industry objected to peer-to-peer file exchanging software, but the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) gave some suggestions to resolve the issue. [4]
Objections to the appropriation of ideas for commerce believe intellectual works should not be compared to material property. Giving someone a physical object results in lost possession and control of that thing and can require asking for something in return, payment or barter. But when someone gives an idea to someone, they lose nothing, and need not ask for anything in return.
Often copylefted artistic creations can be seen to have a (supporting) publicity function, promoting other, more traditionally copyrighted creations by the same artist(s). Artists sticking to an uncompromising copylefting of the whole of their artistic output, could, in addition to services and consultancy, revert to some sort of patronage (sometimes considered as limiting artistic freedom), or to other sources of income, not related to their artistic production (and so mostly limiting the time they can devote to artistic creation too). The least that can be said is that copylefting in art tends toward keeping the art thus produced as much as possible out of the commercial arena—which is considered as an intrinsic positive goal by some.
Some artists, such as Girl Talk and Nine Inch Nails , use copyleft licenses such as the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike license that don't allow commercial use. In this way they can choose to sell their creations without having to compete with others selling copies of the same works. However, some argue that the Attribution-NonCommercialShareAlike license is not a true copyleft. [5]
Where copylefted art has a large audience of modest means or a small audience of considerable wealth, the act of releasing the art may be offered for sale. See Street Performer Protocol . This approach can be used for the release of new works, or can be used for the conversion of proprietary works to copylefted works. See Blender .

Open Music Model
The Open Music Model is an economic and technological framework for the recording industry based on research conducted at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . It predicts that the playback of prerecorded music will be regarded as a service rather than as individually sold products, and that the only system for the digital distribution of music that will be viable against piracy is a subscription-based system supporting file sharing and free of digital rights management . The research also indicated that US$ 9 per month for unlimited use would be the market clearing price at that time, but recommended $5 per month as the long-term optimal price. [1]
Since its creation in 2002, a number of its principles have been adopted throughout the recording industry, [2] and it has been cited as the basis for the business model of many music subscription services . [3] [4]

Overview
The model asserts that there are five necessary requirements for a viable commercial music digital distribution network:
The model was proposed by Shuman Ghosemajumder in his 2002 research paper Advanced Peer-Based Technology Business Models [1] at the MIT Sloan School of Management . The following year, it was publicly referred to as the Open Music Model. [5]
The model suggests changing the way consumers interact with the digital property market: rather than being seen as a good to be purchased from online vendor, music would be treated as a service being provided by the industry, with firms based on the model serving as intermediaries between the music industry and its consumers. The model proposed giving consumers unlimited access to music for the price of US$ 5 per month [1] (as of 2002), based on research showing that this could be a long-term optimal price, expected to bring in a total revenue of over US$ 3 billion per year. [1]
The research demonstrated the demand for third-party file sharing programs. Insofar as the interest for a particular piece of digital property is high, and the risk of acquiring the good via illegitimate means is low, people will naturally flock towards third-party services such as Napster and Morpheus (more recently, Bittorrent and The Pirate Bay ). [1]
The research showed that consumers would use file sharing services not primarily due to cost but because of convenience, indicating that services which provided access to the most music would be the most successful. [1]

Industry adoption
The model predicted the failure of online music distribution systems based on digital rights management . [5] [6]
Criticisms of the model included that it would not eliminate the issue of piracy. [7] Others countered that it was in fact the most viable solution to piracy, [8] since piracy was "inevitable". [9] Supporters argued that it offered a superior alternative to the current law-enforcement based methods used by the recording industry. [10] One startup in Germany , Playment, announced plans to adapt the entire model to a commercial setting as the basis for its business model. [11]
Several aspects of the model have been adopted by the recording industry and its partners over time:

Video on demand
Video on demand (display) ( VOD ) are systems which allow users to select and watch/listen to video or audio content such as movies and TV shows when they choose to, rather than having to watch at a specific broadcast time, which was the prevalent approach with over-the-air broadcasting during much of the 20th century. IPTV technology is often used to bring video on demand to televisions and personal computers . [1]
Television VOD systems can either "stream" content through a set-top box , a computer or other device, allowing viewing in real time, or download it to a device such as a computer, digital video recorder (also called a personal video recorder ) or portable media player for viewing at any time. The majority of cable - and telephone company -based television providers offer both VOD streaming, including pay-per-view and free content, whereby a user buys or selects a movie or television program and it begins to play on the television set almost instantaneously, or downloading to a digital video recorder (DVR) rented or purchased from the provider, or downloaded onto a PC or to a portable device, for viewing in the future. Internet television , using the Internet , is an increasingly popular form of video on demand. VOD can also be accessed via desktop client applications such as the Apple iTunes online content store.
Some airlines offer VOD as in-flight entertainment to passengers through individually controlled video screens embedded in seatbacks or armrests or offered via portable media players . Some video on demand services such as Netflix use a subscription model that requires users to pay a monthly fee to access a bundled set of content, which is mainly movies and TV shows. Other services use an advertising-based model, where access is free for Internet users, and the platforms rely on selling advertisements as their main revenue stream.

Functionality
Downloading and streaming video on demand systems provide the user with all of the features of Portable media players and DVD players . Some VOD systems that store and stream programs from hard disk drives use a memory buffer to allow the user to fast forward and rewind digital videos. It is possible to put video servers on local area networks , in which case they can provide very rapid response to users. Streaming video servers can also serve a wider community via a WAN , in which case the responsiveness may be reduced. Download VOD services are practical to homes equipped with cable modems or DSL connections. Servers for traditional cable and telco VOD services are usually placed at the cable head-end serving a particular market as well as cable hubs in larger markets. In the telco world, they are placed in either the central office, or a newly created location called a Video Head-End Office (VHO).

History
The first video on demand (VOD) systems used tapes as the realtime source of video streams . GTE started as a trial in 1990 with AT&T providing all components. By 1992 VOD servers were supplying previously encoded digital video from disks and DRAM . [2]
In the US the 1982 anti-trust break-up of AT&T resulted in a number of smaller telephone companies called Baby Bells. Following this the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984 prohibited telephone companies from providing video services within their operating regions. In 1993 the National Communication and Information Infrastructure (NII) was proposed and passed by the US House and senate, thus opening the way for the seven Baby Bells Ameritech , Bell Atlantic , BellSouth , NYNEX , Pacific Telesis , Southwestern Bell and U S WEST to implement VOD systems. All of these companies and others began holding trials to set up systems for supplying video on demand over telephone and cable lines.
In November 1992 Bell Atlantic announced a VOD trial. IBM was developing video server code-named Tiger Shark. Concurrently Digital Equipment was developing a scalable video server (configured from small to large for a range of video streams). Bell Atlantic selected IBM and April 1993 the system became the first VOD over ADSL to be deployed outside the lab, serving 50 video streams.
In June 1993 US West filed for a system consisting of the Digital Equipment Corporation Interactive Information Server, with Scientific Atlanta providing the network, and 3DO as the set-top box , with video streams and other information to be deployed to 2500 homes. In 1994-5 US West went on to file for VOD at several cities. 330,000 subscribers in Denver, 290,000 in Minneapolis, and 140,000 in Portland.
Many VOD trials were held with various combinations of server, network and set-top. Of these the primary players in the US were the telephone companies, using DEC, Microsoft, Oracle, IBM, Hewlett-Packard, USA Video, nCube, SGI, and other servers. The DEC server system was used in more of these trials than any other. [3] [4] [5] [6]
The DEC VOD server architecture used interactive gateways to set up video streams and other information for delivery from any of a large number of VAX servers, enabling it in 1993 to support more than 100,000 streams with full VCR -like functionality. In 1994 it would upgrade to the DEC Alpha computer for its VOD servers, allowing it to support more than a million users. [7] By 1994 the Oracle scalable VOD system used massively parallel processors to support from 500 to 30,000 users. The SGI system supported 4000 users. [8] The servers connected to networks of increasing size to eventually support video stream delivery to whole cities.
In the UK, from September 1994, a VOD service formed a major part of the Cambridge Digital Interactive Television Trial [9] in England. This provided video and data to 250 homes and a number of schools connected to the Cambridge Cable network (later part of NTL, now Virgin Media ). The MPEG-1 encoded video was streamed over an ATM network from an ICL media server to set top boxes designed by Acorn Online Media. The trial commenced at a speed of 2 Mbit/s to the home, subsequently increased to 25 Mbit/s. [10] The content was provided by the BBC and Anglia Television . Although a technical success, difficulty in sourcing content was a major issue, and the project closed in 1996.
In 1997, Enron Corporation had entered the broadband market, constructing and purchasing thousands of miles of fiber optic cables throughout the United States. [11] [12] In 2001, Enron and Blockbuster Inc. attempted to create a 20-year deal to stream movies on demand over Enron's fiber optic network. [13] However, the "heavily promoted" deal fell through, with Enron's shares dropping following the announcement. [13]
In 1998, Kingston Communications became the first UK company to launch a fully commercial VOD service and the first to integrate broadcast TV and Internet access through a single set-top box using IP delivery over ADSL. By 2001, Kingston Interactive TV had attracted 15,000 subscribers. After a number of trials, HomeChoice followed in 1999, but were restricted to London . After attracting 40,000 customers, they were bought by Tiscali in 2006 who were in turn bought by Talk Talk in 2009. Cable TV providers Telewest and NTL (now Virgin Media ) launched their VOD services in the United Kingdom in 2005, competing with the leading traditional pay TV distributor BSkyB . BSkyB responded by launching Sky by broadband , later renamed Sky Anytime on PC . The service went live on 2 January 2006. Sky Anytime on PC uses a legal peer-to-peer approach, based on Kontiki technology, to provide very high capacity multi-point downloads of the video content. Instead of the video content all being downloaded from Sky's servers, the content comes from multiple users of the system who have already downloaded the same content. Other UK TV broadcasters have implemented their own versions of the same technology, such as the BBC 's iPlayer , which launched on 25 December 2007, and Channel 4 's 4oD (4 On Demand) which launched in late 2006. Another example of online video publishers using legal peer-to-peer technology is based on Giraffic technology which was launched in early 2011 with large Online Video-on-Demand publishers such as US based VEOH and UK based Craze's OnlineMoviesBox movie rental service.
The BBC , ITV and Channel 4 planned to launch a joint platform provisionally called Kangaroo in 2008. [14] This was abandoned in 2009 following complaints investigated by the Competition Commission . That same year, the assets of the defunct Kangaroo project were bought by Arqiva , [15] who used the technology behind Kangaroo to launch the SeeSaw service in February 2010. [16] A year later, however, SeeSaw was shut down from lack of funding. [17]
VOD services are now available in all parts of the United States , which has the highest global take-up rate of VOD. [18] In 2010, 80% of American Internet users had watched video online, [19] and 42% of mobile users who downloaded video preferred apps to a normal browser. [20] Streaming VOD systems are available on desktop and mobile platforms from cable providers (in tandem with cable modem technology) who use the large downstream bandwidth present on cable systems to deliver movies and television shows to end users, who can typically pause, fast-forward, and rewind VOD movies due to the low latency and random-access nature of cable technology. The large distribution of a single signal makes streaming VOD impractical for most satellite television systems. Both EchoStar / Dish Network and DirecTV offer video on demand programming to PVR -owning subscribers of their satellite TV service. In Demand is a cable VOD service that also offers pay-per-view. Once the programs have been downloaded onto a user's PVR, he or she can watch, play, pause, and seek at their convenience. VOD is also quite common in more expensive hotels . VOD systems that store and provide a user interface for content downloaded directly from the Internet are widely available. [ citation needed ]
According to the European Audiovisual Observatory , 142 paying VOD services were operational in Europe at the end of 2006. The number increased to 650 by 2009. [21] At the January 2010 Consumer Electronic Show in Las Vegas , Sezmi CEO Buno Pati and president Phil Wiser showed a set-top box with a one- terabyte hard drive which could be used for video on demand services previously offered through cable TV or broadband . A movie, for example, could be sent out once using a broadcast signal, rather than numerous times over cable or fiber-optic lines, and this would not involve the expense of adding many miles of lines. Sezmi planned to lease broadcast spectrum to offer a subscription service which National Association of Broadcasters president Gordon H. Smith said would provide a superior picture to that of cable or satellite, at a lower cost. [22]
Developing VOD required extensive negotiations to identify a financial model that would serve both content creators and cable providers while providing desirable content for viewers and an acceptable price point. Key factors identified for determining the economic viability of the VOD model included VOD movie buy rates and setting Hollywood and cable operator revenue splits. [23] Cable providers offered VOD as part of digital subscription packages, which by 2005, primarily allowed cable subscribers to only access an "on-demand" version of content that was already provided in linear traditional broadcasting distribution. These on-demand packages sometimes include "extras" and "bonus footage" in addition to the regular content.

Role of piracy and peer-to-peer
Although video on demand generally refers to delivery mechanisms operating in accordance with applicable laws, the motivation for the development of video on demand services can be traced back to peer-to-peer (P2P) networking and the development of file sharing software. These innovations proved that it was technically possible to offer the consumer potentially every film ever made, in a way which does not burden the original provider with the linear costs associated with centralised streaming media . Some P2P services offered movies and TV shows without having paid for the rights. Torrenting is a popular alternative to legal streaming [24] with 6% [25] of global internet traffic involved in file sharing applications. Many legal services such as Spotify [26] use peer-to-peer distribution to better "scale" their platforms. Netflix is considering switching to a P2P model [27] to cope with net neutrality problems from downstream providers.

Types

Transactional
Transactional video on demand (TVOD) is a distribution method by which customers pay for each individual piece of video on demand content. [28] For example, a customer would pay a fee for each individual movie or TV show that they watch. TVOD has two sub-categories: electronic sell-through (EST), by which customers can permanently access a piece of content once purchased via Internet; and download to rent (DTR), by which customers can access the content for a limited time upon renting. [29] [30] Examples of TVOD services include Apple's iTunes online store and Google 's Google Play service.

Catch-up TV
A growing number of TV stations offer "catch-up TV" as a way for viewers to watch TV shows though their VOD service hours or even days after the original television broadcast. This enables viewers to watch a program when they have free time, even if this is not when the program was originally aired. Some studies show that catch up TV is starting to represent a large amount of the views and hours watched, and that users tend to watch catch up TV programs for longer, when compared to live TV (e.g., regular scheduled broadcast TV). [31]

Subscription models
Subscription VOD (SVOD) services use a subscription business model , where subscribers are charged a monthly fee to access unlimited programs. These services include Netflix , Hulu Plus , Amazon Video , Videoland , HBO Go and CuriosityStream . [32]

Near video on demand
Near video on demand (NVOD) is a pay-per-view consumer video technique used by multi-channel broadcasters using high-bandwidth distribution mechanisms such as satellite and cable television . Multiple copies of a program are broadcast at short time intervals (typically 10–20 minutes) providing convenience for viewers, who can watch the program without needing to tune in at only scheduled point in time. A viewer may only have to wait a few minutes before the next time a movie will be programmed. This form is very bandwidth -intensive and is generally provided only by large operators with a great deal of redundant capacity and has been reduced in popularity as video on demand is implemented.
Only the satellite services Dish Network and DirecTV continue to provide NVOD experiences. These satellite services provide NVOD because many of their customers have no access to the services' broadband VOD services. Before the rise of video on demand, the pay-per-view provider In Demand provided up to 40 channels in 2002, with several films receiving up to four channels on the staggered schedule to provide the NVOD experience for viewers. [33] As of 2014, only four channels (two in high definition, two in standard definition) are provided to facilitate live and event coverage, along with existing league out-of-market sports coverage channels (varied by provider) by the service. In Australia, pay TV broadcaster Foxtel offers NVOD for new release movies. [34]

Push video on demand
Push video on demand is so-named because the provider "pushes" the content out to the viewer's set-top box without the viewer having requested the content. This technique used by a number of broadcasters on systems that lack the connectivity and bandwidth to provide true "streaming" video on demand. Push VOD is also used by broadcasters who want to optimize their video streaming infrastructure by pre-loading the most popular contents (e.g., that week's top ten films or shows) to the consumers' set-top device. In this way, the most popular content is already loaded onto a consumer's set-top DVR. That way, if the consumer requests one of these films, it is already loaded on her/his DVR. A push VOD system uses a personal video recorder (PVR) to store a selection of content, often transmitted in spare capacity overnight or all day long at low bandwidth. Users can watch the downloaded content at the time they desire, immediately and without any buffering issues. Push VOD depends on the viewer recording content, so choices can be limited. [35]
As content occupies space on the PVR hard drive, downloaded content is usually deleted after a week to make way for newer programs or movies. The limited space on a PVR hard drive means that the selection of programs is usually restricted to the most popular content. A new generation of Push VOD solution recently appeared on the market which, by using efficient error correction mechanisms, can free significant amount of bandwidth and that can deliver more than video e.g. digital version of magazines and interactive applications.

Advertising video on demand
Advertising video on demand is a VOD model which uses an advertising-based revenue model. This allows companies that advertise on broadcast and cable channels to reach people who watch shows using VOD. As well, this model allows people to watch programs without paying subscription fees. Hulu has been one of the major AVOD companies, though the company ended free service in August 2016. Ads still run on the subscription service. Yahoo View continues to offer a free AVOD model. Advertisers may find that people watching on VOD services do not want the same ads to appear multiple times. Crackle has introduced the concept of a series of ads for the same company that tie in to what is being watched. [36] [37]

Electronic Frontier Foundation
The Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) is an international non-profit digital rights group based in San Francisco, California .
EFF provides funds for legal defense in court, presents amicus curiae briefs, defends individuals and new technologies from what it considers abusive legal threats, works to expose government malfeasance, provides guidance to the government and courts , organizes political action and mass mailings, supports some new technologies which it believes preserve personal freedoms and online civil liberties, maintains a database and web sites of related news and information, monitors and challenges potential legislation that it believes would infringe on personal liberties and fair use , and solicits a list of what it considers abusive patents with intentions to defeat those that it considers without merit .

History

Foundation
The Electronic Frontier Foundation was formed in July 1990 by John Gilmore , John Perry Barlow and Mitch Kapor in response to a series of actions by law enforcement agencies that led them to conclude that the authorities were gravely uninformed about emerging forms of online communication, [5] and that there was a need for increased protection for Internet civil liberties .
In April 1990, Barlow had been visited by a U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation agent in relation to the theft and distribution of the source code for a series of Macintosh ROMs. Barlow described the visit as "complicated by [the agent's] fairly complete unfamiliarity with computer technology. I realized right away that before I could demonstrate my innocence, I would first have to explain to him what guilt might be." Barlow felt that his experience was symptomatic of a "great paroxysm of governmental confusion during which everyone's liberties would become at risk".
Barlow posted an account of this experience to The WELL online community and was contacted by Mitch Kapor, who had had a similar experience. The pair agreed that there was a need to defend civil liberties on the Internet. Kapor agreed to fund any legal fees associated with such a defense and the pair contacted New York lawyers Rabinowitz, Boudin, Standard, Krinsky and Lieberman about defending several computer hackers from a Harper's magazine forum on computers and freedom who had been the target of Secret Service raids. [5] This generated a large amount of publicity which led to offers of financial support from John Gilmore and Steve Wozniak . Barlow and Kapor continued to research conflicts between the government and technology and in June 1990, Barlow posted online the influential article entitled "Crime & Puzzlement" in which Barlow announced his and Kapor's plans to create an organization to "raise and disburse funds for education, lobbying, and litigation in the areas relating to digital speech and the extension of the Constitution into Cyberspace." [6]
This generated further reaction and support for the ideas of Barlow and Kapor. In late June, Barlow held a series of dinners in San Francisco with major figures in the computer industry [ citation needed ] to develop a coherent response to these perceived threats. Barlow considered that: "The actions of the FBI and Secret Service were symptoms of a growing social crisis: Future Shock. America was entering the Information Age with neither laws nor metaphors for the appropriate protection and conveyance of information itself." [7] Barlow felt that to confront this a formal organization would be needed; he hired Cathy Cook as press coordinator, and began to set up what would become the Electronic Frontier Foundation.
The Electronic Frontier Foundation was formally founded on July 10, 1990, by Kapor and Barlow, who very soon after elected Gilmore, Wozniak, and Stewart Brand to join them on the Board of Directors. [7] Initial funding was provided by Kapor, Wozniak, and an anonymous benefactor. [8] [9]
In 1990, Mike Godwin joined the organization as its first staff counsel. Then in 1991, Esther Dyson and Jerry Berman joined the EFF board of directors. By 1992 Cliff Figallo became the director of the original office in Cambridge, Massachusetts , and in December 1992, Jerry Berman became the acting executive director of the organization as a whole, based in a new second office in Washington, D.C.

Early cases
The creation of the organization was motivated by the massive search and seizure on Steve Jackson Games executed by the United States Secret Service early in 1990. Similar but officially unconnected law-enforcement raids were being conducted across the United States at about that time as part of a state–federal task force called Operation Sundevil . However, the Steve Jackson Games case , which became EFF's first high-profile case, was the major rallying point around which EFF began promoting computer- and Internet-related civil liberties. In 1993, their offices moved to 1001 G Street in Washington, D.C.
EFF's second big case was Bernstein v. United States led by Cindy Cohn , in which programmer and professor Daniel J. Bernstein sued the government for permission to publish his encryption software, Snuffle, and a paper describing it. More recently, the organization has been involved in defending Edward Felten , Jon Lech Johansen and Dmitry Sklyarov .

Expansion and development
The organization was originally located at Mitch Kapor's Kapor Enterprises offices in Cambridge. By the fall of 1993, the main EFF offices were consolidated into a single office, in Washington, D.C., headed by Executive Director Jerry Berman. During this time, some of EFF's attention focused on influencing national policy , to the dislike of some of the members of the organization. In 1994, Berman parted ways with EFF and formed the Center for Democracy and Technology , while Drew Taubman briefly took the reins as executive director.
In 1995, under the auspices of Executive Director Lori Fena , after some downsizing and in an effort to regroup and refocus on their base of support, the organization moved offices to San Francisco, California. There, it took up temporary residence at John Gilmore's Toad Hall, and soon afterward moved into the Hamm's Building at 1550 Bryant St. After Fena moved onto the EFF board of directors for a while, the organization was led briefly by Tara Lemmey , followed by Barry Steinhardt (who had come from the closely allied Technology and Liberty Program at the American Civil Liberties Union , and eventually returned to the ACLU). Not long before EFF's move into new offices at 454 Shotwell St. in SF's Mission District, Mike Godwin departed, long-time Legal Director Shari Steele was appointed as executive director, and staff attorney Cindy Cohn became the legal director.
In the spring of 2006, EFF announced the opening of an office again in Washington, D.C., with two new staff attorneys. [10]
In 2012, EFF began a fundraising campaign for the renovation of a building located at 815 Eddy Street in San Francisco, to serve as its new headquarters. [11] The move was completed in April, 2013. [12]
On April 1, 2015, Shari Steele stepped down as Executive Director. [13] Cindy Cohn became the new executive director, Corynne McSherry became the legal director, and Kurt Opsahl became the general counsel.

DES cracker
By the mid-1990s the EFF was becoming seriously concerned about the refusal of the US Government to license any secure encryption product for export unless it utilized key recovery and claims that governments could not decrypt information when protected by DES , continuing even after the public breaking of the code in the first of the DES Challenges . They coordinated and supported the construction of the EFF DES cracker (nicknamed Deep Crack), using special purpose hardware and software and costing only $210,000. [14] [15] This brought the record for breaking a message down to 56 hours on 17 July 1998 and to under 24 hours on 19 Jan 1999 (in conjunction with distributed.net ).
The EFF published the plans and source code for the cracker. [16] Within four years the Advanced Encryption Standard was standardized as a replacement for DES.

Activities

Legislative activity
The EFF is a leading supporter of the Email Privacy Act . [17]

Litigation
The EFF regularly brings and defends lawsuits at all levels of the US legal system in pursuit of its goals and objectives. Many of the most significant technology law cases have involved the EFF, including MGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd. , Apple v. Does , and others.

Awards
The EFF organizes two sets of awards to promote work in accordance with its goals and objectives:
The EFF Pioneer Awards are awarded annually to recognize individuals who in its opinion are "leaders who are extending freedom and innovation on the electronic frontier." [18] In 2009, the honorees were Limor Fried , Harri Hursti , and Carl Malamud .
The EFF Cooperative Computing Awards are a series of four awards meant "to encourage ordinary Internet users to contribute to solving huge scientific problems," to be awarded to the first individual or group who discovers a prime number with a significant record number of decimal digits. The awards are funded by an anonymous donor. [19] The awards are:

Patent Busting Project
The Patent Busting Project is an Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) initiative challenging patents that the organization claims are illegitimate and suppress innovation or limit online expression. The initiative launched on April 19, 2004 and involves two phases: documenting the damage caused by these patents, and submitting challenges to the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).

Publications
EFF publishes through several outlets such as the online periodical EFFector (ISSN 1062-9424), [22] as well as its websites, blogs, and on social networking services.
EFF's first book was published in 1993 as The Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet , a beginners' how-to manual by contracted technical writer Adam Gaffin, and made available for free download in many formats. MIT Press published it in paperback form in 1994 as Everybody's Guide to the Internet ( ISBN 9780262571050 ). The online edition was updated regularly throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, and translated into dozens of languages.
The organization's second book, Protecting Yourself Online ( ISBN 9780062515124 ), an overview of digital civil liberties, was written in 1998 by technical writer Robert B. Gelman and EFF Communications Director Stanton McCandlish, and published by HarperCollins .
A third book, Cracking DES: Secrets of Encryption Research, Wiretap Politics & Chip Design ( ISBN 9781565925205 ), focusing on EFF's DES Cracker project, was published the same year by O'Reilly Media .
A digital book, Pwning Tomorrow , an anthology of speculative fiction , was produced in 2015 as part of EFF's 25th anniversary activities, and includes contributions from 22 writers, including Charlie Jane Anders , Paolo Bacigalupi , Lauren Beukes , David Brin , Pat Cadigan , Cory Doctorow , Neil Gaiman , Eileen Gunn , Kameron Hurley , James Patrick Kelly , Ramez Naam , Annalee Newitz , Hannu Rajaniemi , Rudy Rucker , Lewis Shiner , Bruce Sterling , and Charles Yu . [23]
The Electronic Frontier Foundation's blog , DeepLinks , is a major section of its main website at EFF.org.
The EFF sent a video message of support to global grassroots movement CryptoParty . [24]

Recent Activism
The EFF was active in the United States presidential election 2016 because of online phishing related to the controversy over fabrication of election results. J. Alex Halderman , a computer security professor at the University of Michigan , wrote an article that was published in Medium in 2016 stating he thought it was advisable to have a recount on some of the election results from states like Wisconsin , Michigan , and Pennsylvania . [25] In retaliation for Halderman standing up for the uncertain election results, a hacker sent anti-Semitic and racist emails to students at University of Michigan signed from Halderman. The EFF publicizes these controversies and promotes the reduction of online phishing. [26]

Software
The EFF has developed some software and browser add-ons, including Switzerland , HTTPS Everywhere , and Privacy Badger .

Secure Messaging Scorecard
The EFF has also conducted a project named Secure Messaging Scorecard which "evaluated apps and tools based on a set of seven specific criteria ranging from whether messages were encrypted in transit to whether or not the code had been recently audited." [27] Version 1.0 is accessible here . As of April 21, 2017, a revised version is under development. [27]

Support
Charity Navigator has given the EFF an overall rating of four out of four stars, including four stars for its financial efficiency and capacity. [28]

Financial
EFF as of 2014 had $23 million in assets, [29] having received multiple grants or donations above 1 million dollars in its history. This paragraph lists the main ones.
On February 18, 2004, the EFF announced that it had received a bequest of US$ 1.2 million from the estate of EFF member Leonard Zubkoff, a software developer and entrepreneur. [30] It used $1 million of this money to establish the EFF Endowment Fund for Digital Civil Liberties.
Beginning in 2010, the EFF began regularly receiving income from the Humble Indie Bundle . In 2010, these donations made up 14% of EFF's total revenue. [31] Between 2011 and 2014, the amount received from Humble Bundle reached $7.5 millions or 23% of the EFF total revenues. [29] [32] [33]
In 2011, the EFF received $1 million from Google as part of a settlement of a class action related to privacy issues involving Google Buzz . The Electronic Privacy Information Center and seven other privacy-focused nonprofits protested that the plaintiffs' lawyers and Google had, in effect, arranged to give the majority of those funds "to organizations that are currently paid by Google to lobby for or to consult for the company." An additional $1 million was obtained from Facebook in a similar settlement. [34]
In December 2014, the Adams Charitable Foundation granted EFF a $3 million endowment to fund the new Adams Chair for Internet Rights. [29]

Other
The agitprop art group Psychological Industries has independently issued buttons with pop culture tropes such as the logo of the Laughing Man from the anime series Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex (with the original The Catcher in the Rye quotation replaced with the slogan of Anonymous ), a bleeding roller derby jammer , and the " We Can Do It! " woman (often misidentified as Rosie the Riveter ) on a series of buttons on behalf of the EFF. [35]
In late June 2014 the EFF flew a GEFA-FLUG AS 105 GD/4 [36] blimp owned by, and in conjunction with, Greenpeace over the NSA 's Bluffdale -based Utah Data Center in protest against its purported illegal spying. [37]

In literature
The EFF is mentioned in many novels that deal with cryptography or digital rights issues, including Digital Fortress by Dan Brown (1998; released the same year the EFF DES cracker was built), and the works of Cory Doctorow (who is a former EFF regional director for Europe).

Pirate Party
Pirate Party is a label adopted by political parties in different countries. Pirate parties support civil rights , direct democracy and participation in government , reform of copyright and patent law , free sharing of knowledge ( open content ), information privacy , transparency , freedom of information , free speech , anti-corruption and Internet neutrality . [1]

History
The first Pirate Party to be established was the Pirate Party of Sweden ( Swedish : Piratpartiet ), whose website was launched on 1 January 2006 by Rickard Falkvinge . Falkvinge was inspired to found the party after he found that Swedish politicians were generally unresponsive to Sweden's debate over changes to copyright law in 2005. [2]
The United States Pirate Party was founded on 6 June 2006 by University of Georgia graduate student Brent Allison. The party's concerns were abolishing the Digital Millennium Copyright Act , reducing the length of copyrights from 95 years after publication or 70 years after the author's death to 14 years, and the expiry of patents that do not result in significant progress after four years, as opposed to 20 years. However, Allison stepped down as leader three days after founding the party. [3]
The Pirate Party of Austria ( German : Piratenpartei Österreichs ) was founded in July 2006 in the run-up to the 2006 Austrian legislative election by Florian Hufsky and Jürgen "Juxi" Leitner. [4]
The 2009 European Parliament election took place between the 4 and 7 June 2009, and various Pirate Parties stood candidates. The most success was had in Sweden , where the Pirate Party of Sweden won 7.1% of the vote, and had Christian Engström elected as the first ever Pirate Party Member of European Parliament (MEP). Engström described the result as "fantastic" and said "we will use all of our strength to defend personal integrity and our civil rights". [5] [6] Following the introduction of the Treaty of Lisbon , the Pirate Party of Sweden were afforded another MEP in 2011, that being Amelia Andersdotter .
On 30 July 2009, the Pirate Party UK was registered with the Electoral Commission . Its first Leader was Andrew Robinson, and its Treasurer was Eric Priezkalns. [7] [8] [9]
In April 2010, an international organisation to encourage cooperation and unity between Pirate Parties, Pirate Parties International , was founded in Belgium. [10]
In the 2011 Berlin state election to the Abgeordnetenhaus of Berlin , the Pirate Party of Berlin (a state chapter of Pirate Party Germany ) won 8.9% of the vote, which corresponded to winning 15 seats. [11] [12] John Naughton , writing for The Guardian , argued that the Pirate Party of Berlin's success could not be replicated by the Pirate Party UK , as the UK does not use a proportional representation electoral system. [13]
In the 2013 Icelandic parliamentary election , the Icelandic Pirate Party won 5.1% of the vote, returning three Pirate Party Members of Parliament . Those were Birgitta Jónsdóttir for the Southwest Constituency , Helgi Hrafn Gunnarsson for Reykjavik Constituency North and Jón Þór Ólafsson for Reykjavik Constituency South . [14] [15] Jónsdóttir had previously been an MP for the Citizens' Movement (from 2009 to 2013), representing Reykjavik Constituency South. Currently, it is the largest political party in Iceland. In the most recent election, it won 23.9% of the vote. [16]
The 2014 European Parliament election took place between the 22 and 24 May. Julia Reda was at the top of the list for Pirate Party Germany , and was subsequently elected as the party received 1.45% of the vote. Other notable results include the Czech Pirate Party , who received 4.78% of the vote, meaning they were 0.22% off getting elected, the Pirate Party of Luxembourg , who received 4.23% of the vote, and the Pirate Party of Sweden , who received 2.19% of the vote, but lost both their MEPs. [17]
Reda had previously worked as an assistant in the office of former Pirate Party MEP Amelia Andersdotter. [18] On 11 June 2014, Reda was elected Vice-President of the Greens/EFA group in the European Parliament. [19] Reda was given the job of copyright reform rapporteur. [20]
The Icelandic Pirate Party was leading the national polls in March 2015, with 23.9%. In the entire history of Iceland as an independent country, this was the first time a political party other than the Independence Party polled as the largest party. The Independence Party polled 23.4%, only 0.5% behind the Pirate Party. According to the poll, the Pirate Party would win 16 seats in the Althing . Rick Falkvinge described the news as "bloody awesome". [21] [22]
In April 2016, in the wake of the Panama Papers scandal, polls showed the Icelandic Pirate Party at 43% and the Independence Party at 21.6%, [23] although the Pirate Party eventually won 15% of the vote in the 29 October 2016 parliamentary election .
In April 2017, a group of students at University of California, Berkeley formed a Pirate Party to participate in the Associated Students of the University of California senate elections, winning the only third-party seat. [24]

Common policies
While parties vary insofar as specific policies go, common themes of the Pirate movement include:

Copyright and censorship
Some campaigns have included demands for the reform of copyright and patent laws. [25] In 2010, Swedish MEP Christian Engström called for supporters of amendments to the Data Retention Directive to withdraw their signatures, citing a misleading campaign. [26]

International organizations

Pirate Parties International
Pirate Parties International (PPI) is the umbrella organization of the national Pirate Parties. Since 2006, the organization has existed as a loose union [27] of the national parties. Since October 2009, Pirate Parties International has had the status of a non-governmental organization (Feitelijke vereniging) based in Belgium . The organization was officially founded at a conference from 16 to 18 April 2010 in Brussels , when the organization's statutes were adopted by the 22 national pirate parties represented at the event. [28]

European Pirate Party
The European Pirate Party ( PPEU ) is a European political party founded in March 2014 which consists of various pirate parties within European countries. [29]

Pirates without Borders
Pirates Without Borders is an international association of pirates. Unlike Pirate Parties International (which accepts only parties as voting members and organizations as observing members), Pirates Without Borders accept individuals as members. The PWB see themselves as a basis for international projects. Through global cooperation, they strive to reveal the impact of multinational trade agreements on all people on Earth, and foster freedom and democracy. [30] PWB originates from an independent committee for the coordination of Pirate parties in German-speaking countries, known as DACHLuke (DACHL = Germany-Austria-Switzerland-Luxembourg).
Since the Pirate Parties International Conference 2011 on 12 and 13 March 2011, PWB is an "observing member" of Pirate Parties International. The previously independent project "pirate streaming" has become a part of Pirates without Borders since 3 May 2011.

Parti Pirate Francophone
In Parti Pirate Francophone, the French-speaking Pirate Parties are organized. Current members are the pirates parties in Belgium, Côte d'Ivoire, France, Canada, and Switzerland. [ citation needed ]

Lawrence Lessig
Lester Lawrence "Larry" Lessig III (born June 3, 1961) is an American academic, attorney, and political activist . He is the Roy L. Furman Professor of Law at Harvard Law School and the former director of the Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics at Harvard University . [1] Lessig was a candidate for the Democratic Party 's nomination for President of the United States in the 2016 U.S. presidential election , but withdrew before the primaries.
Lessig is a proponent of reduced legal restrictions on copyright , trademark , and radio frequency spectrum, particularly in technology applications. In 2001, he founded Creative Commons , a non-profit organization devoted to expanding the range of creative works available for others to build upon and to share legally. Prior to his most recent appointment at Harvard, he was a professor of law at Stanford Law School , where he founded the Center for Internet and Society , and at the University of Chicago . He is a former board member of the Free Software Foundation and Software Freedom Law Center ; the Washington, D.C. lobbying groups Public Knowledge and Free Press ; and the Electronic Frontier Foundation . [2]
As a political activist, Lessig has called for state-based activism to promote substantive reform of government with a Second Constitutional Convention . [3] In May 2014, he launched a crowd-funded political action committee which he termed Mayday PAC with the purpose of electing candidates to Congress who would pass campaign finance reform . [4] Lessig is also the co-founder of Rootstrikers , and is on the boards of MapLight and Represent.Us . [5] He serves on the advisory boards of the Democracy Café [6] and the Sunlight Foundation . [7]
In August 2015, Lessig announced that he was exploring a possible candidacy for President of the United States, promising to run if his exploratory committee raised $1 million by Labor Day . [8] [9] After accomplishing this, on September 6, 2015, Lessig announced that he was entering the race to become a candidate for the 2016 Democratic Party 's presidential nomination . [10] Lessig has described his candidacy as a referendum on campaign finance reform and electoral reform legislation. He stated that, if elected, he would serve a full term as president with his proposed reforms as his legislative priorities. [11] In November 2015, he ended his campaign. [12]

Academic career
Lessig earned a B.A. degree in Economics and a B.S. degree in Management ( Wharton School ) from the University of Pennsylvania , an M.A. degree in Philosophy from the University of Cambridge ( Trinity ) in England, and a J.D. degree from Yale Law School in 1989. After graduating from law school, he clerked for a year for Judge Richard Posner , at the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago , Illinois , and another year for Justice Antonin Scalia at the Supreme Court . [13]
Lessig started his academic career at the University of Chicago Law School , where he was Professor from 1991 to 1997. As co-director of the Center for the Study of Constitutionalism in Eastern Europe there, he helped the newly-independent Republic of Georgia draft a constitution. [14] From 1997 to 2000, he was at Harvard Law School , holding for a year the chair of Berkman Professor of Law, affiliated with the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society . [13] He subsequently joined Stanford Law School , where he established the school's Center for Internet and Society . [15]
Lessig returned to Harvard in July 2009 as Professor and Director of the Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics. [16] In 2013, Lessig was appointed as the Roy L. Furman Professor of Law and Leadership; his chair lecture was titled "Aaron's Laws: Law and Justice in a Digital Age." [17] [18]

In popular culture
Lessig was portrayed by Christopher Lloyd in " The Wake Up Call ", during season 6 of The West Wing . [19]

Political background
Lessig has been politically liberal since studying philosophy at Cambridge in the mid-1980s. By the late 1980s when he was selected to serve as a law clerk for two influential conservative judges, Judge Richard Posner and Justice Antonin Scalia , he was effectively the token liberal on their staffs, chosen for his brilliance rather than for his ideology. [20] Posner would later call him "the most distinguished law professor of his generation." [21]
Lessig has emphasized in interviews that his philosophy experience at Cambridge radically changed his values and career path. Previously, he had held strong conservative or libertarian political views, desired a career in business, was a highly active member of Teenage Republicans , served as the Youth Governor for Pennsylvania through the YMCA Youth and Government program [22] in 1978, and almost pursued a Republican political career.
What was intended to be a year abroad at Cambridge convinced him instead to stay another two years to complete an undergraduate degree in philosophy and develop his changed political values. During this time, he also traveled in the Eastern Bloc , where he acquired a lifelong interest in Eastern European law and politics.
Lessig remains skeptical of government intervention but favors some regulation, calling himself "a constitutionalist." On one occasion, Lessig also commended the John McCain campaign for discussing fair use rights in a letter to YouTube where it took issue with YouTube for indulging overreaching copyright claims leading to the removal of various campaign videos. [23]
Lessig has known President Barack Obama since their days of both teaching law at the University of Chicago. In 2007, Lessig came out in favor of then Democratic primary candidate Barack Obama, citing the transformative nature of the Obama campaign as one of his chief reasons. He was subsequently mentioned as a candidate to head the Federal Communications Commission , which regulates the telecommunications industry. [24]

Internet and computer activism

"Code is law"
In computer science, "code" typically refers to the text of a computer program (the source code ). In law, "code" can refer to the texts that constitute statutory law . In his 1999 book Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace , Lessig explores the ways in which code in both senses can be instruments for social control , leading to his dictum that "Code is law." Lessig later updated his work in order to keep up with the prevailing views of the time and released the book as Code: Version 2.0 in December 2006.

Remix Culture
Lessig has been a proponent of the Remix culture since the early 2000s, [25] in his 2008 book Remix [26] [27] he presents this as a desirable concept for society.

Free Culture
On March 28, 2004 he was elected to the FSF's Board of Directors. [28] He proposed the concept of " Free Culture ". [29] He also supports free and open source software and open spectrum . [30] At his Free Culture keynote at the O'Reilly Open Source Convention 2002, a few minutes of his speech was about software patents , [31] which he views as a rising threat to free software , open source software and innovation.
In March 2006, Lessig joined the board of advisors of the Digital Universe project. [32] A few months later, Lessig gave a talk on the ethics of the Free Culture Movement at the 2006 Wikimania conference. In December 2006, his lecture On Free, and the Differences between Culture and Code was one of the highlights at 23C3 Who can you trust? . [33]
Lessig claimed in 2009 that, because 70% of young people obtain digital information from illegal sources, the law should be changed. [34]
In a foreword to the Freesouls book project, Lessig makes an argument in favor of amateur artists in the world of digital technologies: "there is a different class of amateur creators that digital technologies have ... enabled, and a different kind of creativity has emerged as a consequence." [35]
Lessig is also a well-known critic of copyright term extensions.

Net neutrality
Lessig has long been known to be a supporter of net neutrality . In 2006, he testified before the US Senate that he believed Congress should ratify Michael Powell 's four Internet freedoms and add a restriction to access-tiering, i.e. he does not believe content providers should be charged different amounts. The reason is that the Internet, under the neutral end-to-end design is an invaluable platform for innovation, and the economic benefit of innovation would be threatened if large corporations could purchase faster service to the detriment of newer companies with less capital. However, Lessig has supported the idea of allowing ISPs to give consumers the option of different tiers of service at different prices. He was reported on CBC News as saying that he has always been in favour of allowing internet providers to charge differently for consumer access at different speeds. He said, "Now, no doubt, my position might be wrong. Some friends in the network neutrality movement as well as some scholars believe it is wrong—that it doesn't go far enough. But the suggestion that the position is 'recent' is baseless. If I'm wrong, I've always been wrong." [36]

Legislative reform
Despite presenting an anti-regulatory standpoint in many fora, Lessig still sees the need for legislative enforcement of copyright. He has called for limiting copyright terms for creative professionals to five years, but believes that creative professionals' work, many of them independent, would become more easily and quickly available if bureaucratic procedure were introduced to renew trademarks for up to 75 years after this five-year term. [37] Lessig has repeatedly taken a stance that privatization through legislation like that seen in the 1980s in the UK with British Telecommunications is not the best way to help the Internet grow. He said, "When government disappears, it's not as if paradise will take its place. When governments are gone, other interests will take their place," "My claim is that we should focus on the values of liberty. If there is not government to insist on those values, then who?" "The single unifying force should be that we govern ourselves." [38]

Legal challenges
Lessig's political opinions on copyright law have led to legal challenges where he has attempted to put them into action without legislative change. In March 2003, he acknowledged severe disappointment with his Supreme Court defeat in the Eldred copyright-extension case, where he unsuccessfully tried to convince Chief Justice William Rehnquist, who had sympathies for de-regulation, to back his "market-based" approach to intellectual property regulation. [42]
In August 2013, Lawrence Lessig brought suit against Liberation Music PTY Ltd., after Liberation issued a takedown notice of one of Lessig's lectures on YouTube which had used the song " Lisztomania " by the band Phoenix , whom Liberation Music represents. [43] [44] Lessig sought damages under section 512(f) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act , which holds parties liable for misrepresentations of infringement or removal of material. [45] Lessig was represented by the Electronic Frontier Foundation and Jones Day . [46] In February 2014, the case ended with a settlement in which Liberation Music admitted wrongdoing in issuing the takedown notice, issued an apology, and paid a confidential sum in compensation. [47] [48]

Killswitch
In October 2014, Killswitch , a film featuring Lawrence Lessig, as well as Aaron Swartz , Tim Wu , and Edward Snowden received its World Premiere at the Woodstock Film Festival , where it won the award for Best Editing. In the film, Lessig frames the story of two young hacktivists, Swartz and Snowden, who symbolize the disruptive and dynamic nature of the Internet. The film reveals the emotional bond between Lessig and Swartz, and how it was Swartz (the mentee) that challenged Lessig (the mentor) to engage in the political activism that has led to Lessig's crusade for campaign finance reform . [49] [50]
In February 2015, Killswitch was invited to screen at the Capitol Visitor's Center in Washington DC by Congressman Alan Grayson . The event was held on the eve of the Federal Communications Commission's historic decision on Net Neutrality . Lessig, Congressman Grayson, and Free Press (organization) CEO Craig Aaron spoke about the importance of protecting net neutrality and the free and open Internet. [51] [52]
Congressman Grayson states that Killswitch is "One of the most honest accounts of the battle to control the Internet -- and access to information itself.". [51] Richard von Busack of the Metro Silicon Valley , writes of Killswitch , "Some of the most lapidary use of found footage this side of The Atomic Café". [49] Fred Swegles of the Orange County Register , remarks, "Anyone who values unfettered access to online information is apt to be captivated by Killswitch , a gripping and fast-paced documentary." [50] Kathy Gill of GeekWire asserts that " Killswitch is much more than a dry recitation of technical history. Director Ali Akbarzadeh, producer Jeff Horn, and writer Chris Dollar created a human centered story. A large part of that connection comes from Lessig and his relationship with Swartz." [53]

The Electors Trust
In December 2016 Lawrence Lessig and Laurence Tribe established The Electors Trust under the aegis of EqualCitizens.US to provide pro bono legal counsel as well as a secure communications platform for those of the 538 members of the United States Electoral College who are regarding a vote of conscience against Donald Trump in the presidential election [54]

Money in politics activism
At the iCommons iSummit 07, Lessig announced that he would stop focusing his attention on copyright and related matters and work on political corruption instead, as the result of a transformative conversation with Aaron Swartz , a young internet prodigy whom Lessig met through his work with Creative Commons . [55] This new work was partially facilitated through his wiki , Lessig Wiki, which he has encouraged the public to use to document cases of corruption. [56] Lessig criticized the revolving door phenomenon in which legislators and staffers leave office to become lobbyists and have become beholden to special interests. [57]
In February 2008, a Facebook group formed by law professor John Palfrey encouraged him to run for Congress from California's 12th congressional district , the seat vacated by the death of U.S. Representative Tom Lantos . [58] Later that month, after forming an "exploratory project", he decided not to run for the vacant seat. [59]

Rootstrikers
Despite having decided to forgo running for Congress himself, Lessig remained interested in attempting to change Congress to reduce corruption. [59] To this end, he worked with political consultant Joe Trippi to launch a web based project called " Change Congress ". [60] In a press conference on March 20, 2008, Lessig explained that he hoped the Change Congress website would help provide technological tools voters could use to hold their representatives accountable and reduce the influence of money on politics. [61] He is a board member of MAPLight.org , a nonprofit research group illuminating the connection between money and politics.
Change Congress later became Fix Congress First , and was finally named Rootstrikers . [62] [63] In November 2011, Lessig announced that Rootstrikers would join forces with Dylan Ratigan 's Get Money Out campaign, under the umbrella of the United Republic organization. [64] [65] Rootstrikers subsequently came under the aegis of Demand Progress , an organization co-founded by Aaron Swartz.

Article V convention
In 2010, Lessig began to organize for a national Article V convention. [66] He co-founded Fix Congress First! with Joe Trippi . [67] In a speech in 2011, Lessig revealed that he was disappointed with Obama's performance in office, criticizing it as a "betrayal", and he criticized the president for using "the (Hillary) Clinton playbook". [68] Lessig has called for state governments to call for a national Article V convention, [69] including by supporting Wolf PAC, a national organization attempting to call an Article V convention to address the problem. [70] The convention Lessig supports would be populated by a "random proportional selection of citizens" which he suggested would work effectively. He said "politics is a rare sport where the amateur is better than the professional." [69] He promoted this idea at a September 24–25, 2011, conference he co-chaired with the Tea Party Patriots ' national coordinator, [71] in Lessig's October 5, 2011, book, Republic, Lost : How Money Corrupts Congress—and a Plan to Stop It, [72] and at the Occupy protest in Washington, DC. [73] Reporter Dan Froomkin said the book offers a manifesto for the Occupy Wall Street protestors, focusing on the core problem of corruption in both political parties and their elections. [74] An Article V convention does not dictate a solution, but Lessig would support a constitutional amendment that would allow legislatures to limit political contributions from non-citizens, including corporations, anonymous organizations, and foreign nationals, and he also supports public campaign financing and electoral college reform to establish the one person, one vote principle. [75]

New Hampshire Rebellion
The New Hampshire Rebellion is a walk to raise awareness about corruption in politics. [76] The event began in 2014 with a 185-mile march in New Hampshire. [77] In its second year the walk expanded to include other locations in New Hampshire. [78]
From January 11 to 24, 2014, Lessig and many others, like New York activist Jeff Kurzon , marched from Dixville Notch, New Hampshire to Nashua (a 185-mile march) to promote the idea of tackling "the systemic corruption in Washington". [ citation needed ] Lessig chose this language over the related term "campaign finance reform," commenting that "Saying we need campaign finance reform is like referring to an alcoholic as someone who has a liquid intake problem." [ citation needed ] The walk was to continue the work of NH Native Doris "Granny D" Haddock , and in honor of deceased activist Aaron Swartz . [76] The New Hampshire Rebellion marched 16 miles from Hampton to New Castle on the New Hampshire Seacoast. [79] The initial location was also chosen because of its important and visible role in the quadrennial "New Hampshire primaries", the traditional first primary of the presidential election. [79]

2016 presidential candidacy
Lessig announced the launch of his presidential campaign on September 6, 2015. On August 11, 2015, Lessig announced that he had launched an exploratory campaign for the purpose of exploring his prospects of winning the Democratic Party 's nomination for President of the United States in the 2016 election . [9] [80] Lessig pledged to seek the nomination if he raised $1 million by Labor Day 2015. [80] The announcement was widely reported in national media outlets, and was timed to coincide with a media blitz by the Lessig 2016 Campaign. Lessig was interviewed in The New York Times and Bloomberg . Campaign messages and Lessig's electoral finance reform positions were circulated widely on social media. [80] [81] His campaign was focused on a single issue: The Citizen Equality Act , a proposal that couples campaign finance reform with other laws aimed at curbing gerrymandering and ensuring voting access . [80] As an expression of his commitment to the proposal, Lessig initially promised to resign once the Citizen Equality Act became law and turn the presidency over to his vice president, who would then serve out the remainder of the term as a typical American president and act on a variety of issues. In October 2015, Lessig abandoned his automatic resignation plan and adopted a full policy platform for the presidency, though he did retain the passage of the Citizen Equality Act as his primary legislative objective. [80]
He announced the end of his campaign on November 2, 2015. [12]

Awards and honors
In 2002, Lessig received the Award for the Advancement of Free Software from the Free Software Foundation (FSF). [28] He also received the Scientific American 50 Award for having "argued against interpretations of copyright that could stifle innovation and discourse online." [82] Then, in 2006, Lessig was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences . [83]
In 2011, Lessig was named to the Fastcase 50, "honoring the law's smartest, most courageous innovators, techies, visionaries, and leaders." [84] Lessig was awarded honorary doctorates by the Faculty of Social Sciences at Lund University , Sweden in 2013 and by l'Université Catholique de Louvain in 2014. [85] [86] Lessig received the 2014 Webby Lifetime Achievement award for co-founding Creative Commons and defending Net Neutrality and the free and open software movement. [87]

Personal life
Lessig was born in Rapid City, South Dakota , the son of Patricia, who sold real estate, and Lester L. "Jack" Lessig, an engineer. [88] [89] He grew up in Williamsport, Pennsylvania .
In May 2005, it was revealed that Lessig had experienced sexual abuse by the director at the American Boychoir School , which he had attended as an adolescent. [90] Lessig reached a settlement with the school in the past, under confidential terms. He revealed his experiences in the course of representing another student victim, John Hardwicke, in court. [91] In August 2006, he succeeded in persuading the New Jersey Supreme Court to restrict the scope of immunity radically, which had protected nonprofits that failed to prevent sexual abuse from legal liability. [92]
Lessig is married to Bettina Neuefeind, a German-born Harvard University colleague. The two married in 1999. [93] He and Neuefeind have three children (Willem, Teo, and Tess). [94]
